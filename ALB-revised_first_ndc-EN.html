      <h1><a>1. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</a></h1>
      <p>The Republic of Albania is a Balkan country in Southeast Europe. It is located to the North of Greece and to the South of Montenegro and Kosovo. To the West, it borders the Ionian (South) and the Adriatic (North) seas, in the Mediterranean Sea, for 450 km. Albania’s land area totals 28,748 km2. The country’s average altitude is 700 meters above sea level, as 70% of the territory is mountainous.</p>
      <p>Albania has a subtropical Mediterranean climate, which involves mild and humid winters and hot and dry summers, with some continental influence. The mean annual temperature (1901-2016) is 11.5°C, and mean precipitation is 1019.8 mm. <strong>Error! Reference source not found.</strong> below shows the average monthly temperature and rainfall.</p>

      <p>Albania is a highly biodiverse country. The mountainous topography, the different geological strata, types of soil and Mediterranean climate with some continental influence contribute to this diversity. About 17% of Albanian territory had protected status in 2016. Albania possesses important water resources. They are an important source of hydropower, producing 90% of the country’s energy and providing irrigation for agriculture. Water resources have been polluted in populated areas. Albania also counts with metals and oil.</p>
      <p>In 2019, Albania had an estimated population of 2.88 million. Recent demographic developments show that Albania's population is shrinking and heading towards aging. This is due to negative natural growth and most importantly negative net migration. Most studies project that the demographic decline will continue.</p>
      <p>Albania is fairly densely populated. In 2018, the average population density was 99.7 inhabitants per km2. Albania has experienced a strong urbanization process: urban population increased from one-third in the early 1990s to an estimate of almost two-thirds (62%) in 2020. The largest city is Tirana, the country’s capital, which had an estimated population of 421,000 in 2020, with a greater metropolitan population of 764,000. The second-largest metropolitan area in Albania is the ancient city of Durrës, only 30 km from Tirana, with an estimated population of 201,519 in 2020. Other major cities include Vlorë, Elbasan and Shkodër. The urban population share is expected to rise.</p>
      <p>After 50 years of communist rule, Albania has transformed from one of the poorest countries in Europe in the early 1990s to an upper-middle-income country in 2020. As a result of three decades of remarkable economic growth, in 2019, its GDP amounted to USD 15.3 billion, and its GDP per capita to USD 5,450.</p>
      <p>This economic growth has been associated with structural economic changes, with a transition from an economy based on raw materials and agriculture and industry, into a more diverse economy, where the service sector plays a leading role. In 2019, the service sector (represented by the subsectors of trade, transport, commercial activities and telecommunication services) constituted about 50% of the GDP of the country. Industry and construction made up about 20% of the GDP and the agriculture sector contributed about 19% of the GDP. Public debt was over 65% in 2019.</p>
      <p>Over the last three decades social indicators have improved in Albania. In 2019 Albania’s Human Development Index (HDI) value, which considers life expectancy at birth, education and gross national income per capita, was 0.795— which put the country in the high human development category— positioning it at 69 out of 189 countries and territories<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In 2012, the most recent year with official poverty figures, 14.3% of Albanians lived below the national poverty line<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, while 1.1% lived below the international extreme poverty line and 39.1% lived below the upper middle income poverty line. Unemployment reached a historically low 11.4 percent in Q3 of 2019. The latest Gini index was estimated at 33.2 in 2017 (0 representing equality and 100 inequality).</p>
      <p>The socio-economic progress of Albania has been recently hampered by two shocks. The country was hit by a devastating earthquake in November 2019. The earthquake, measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale, the strongest in 30 years, caused 51 fatalities, injured at least 913 people and affected over 200,000 people (17,000 people were displaced). It caused extensive damage to physical assets in 11 municipalities, including the two most populous and developed municipalities (Tirana and Durres). Tourism assets and housing were hit the hardest. The earthquake led to losses equivalent to an estimated 7.5% of GDP.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the reconstruction efforts, the COVID-19 crisis is putting more pressure on the Government’s budget and response, and the country’s socio-economic progress, as it forced Albania, as other countries, to put key economic sectors in lockdown. The tourism sector, a key driver of growth, was hit especially hard because of containment measures and travel restrictions. In the second quarter of 2020, employment declined by 3.6% year-on-year. The earthquake and the pandemic are expected to significantly increase poverty, resulting in poverty rates comparable to those in 2005.</p>
      <p>Since the early 1990s, Albania has implemented important structural reforms to promote equitable economic growth and improve governance and public service delivery. In a transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy, this has included macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability, financial sector stabilization, energy reform, social assistance and disability reform, and territorial decentralization.</p>
      <p>The key national planning document currently in place is the National Strategy for Development and Integration 2015-2020 (NSDI-II), which was adopted by the Government of Albania in May 2016. This strategic document reflects the vision, priorities, objectives and means for social and economic development of the country up to 2020. About 37 sectoral strategies<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> adopted by the Albanian Government (and in three cases, by the Parliament) complement the NSDI-II. The NSDI-II is organized around 13 cross-cutting foundations on good governance, democracy and rule of law, and four main sectoral pillars: i) growth through macroeconomic and fiscal stability; ii) economic growth through enhanced competitiveness and innovation; ii) investing in social capital and social cohesion and iv) growth through sustainable use of natural resources and territorial development. National elections took place in April 2021.</p>
      <p>The overarching goal of NSDI-II is the accession to the European Union (EU). After the EU’s decision in March 2014 to open accession talks with the country, Albania is advancing the EU integration agenda. As part of the process, the country is transposing and implementing parts of the EU legislation - most national plans or actions, including in the environmental domain, are now designed to take into account policies and directives of the EU. Albania is also considering the EU’s strategies and plans for the Western Balkans of which Albania is part<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, such as the EU Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, adopted in October 2020, the EU Green Deal for the Western Balkans<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, adopted in November 2020, and the the Decision Nr. 90, date 17.2.2021 « On approval of National Plan for European Integration, 2021–2023 »among others.</p>
      <p>Besides the EU, Albania is an active participant in multilateral organizations and agreements. The Republic of Albania is a signatory Party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was ratified by the Albanian Parliament in 1994. In April 2016, Albania signed the Paris Agreement. In December 2017 the Albanian Parliament unanimously approved a resolution confirming the country’s commitment to Agenda 2030 and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs).</p>
      <p>In line with global and regional commitments and national priorities, Albania has made progress on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In 2014, the Albanian government established the Inter-Ministerial Working Group on Climate Change (IMWGCC), which coordinates all institutions involved in climate change processes and facilitates the integration of climate change into relevant new and existing policies, programs and activities. In July 2019 Albania approved a National Climate Change Strategy and corresponding national mitigation and adaptation plans. The country has implemented several mitigation and adaptation projects and studies.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Albania submitted its first NDC in November 2015, with the commitment “to reduce CO2 emissions compared to the baseline scenario in the period of 2016 and 2030 by 11.5%, or 708 kT CO2 emission reduction in 2030”. Regarding mitigation, the scope was limited in terms of both gases and sectors. The NDC only covered CO2 gases - it did not include other relevant gases such as CH4, N2O, F-gases; and it only covered energy and industrial processes sectors - it did not include agriculture, Forest and Other Land Use (FOLU) and waste sectors. No references to specific mitigation actions or adaptation were included.</p>

          <h2><a>2.1 Situation of the country</a></h2>
              <h3>2.1.1. Historical GHG emissions trends</h3>
              <p>Albania’s greenhouse gas (GHG) mean annual emissions, according to the national inventory prepared for the 4th National Communication and the final draft of 1st BUR, amounted to 10.8 Mt CO2e/y in the period 2009-2016. Compared to the rest of Europe, this level of emission is low. While the level of emissions per capita is 8.7 t CO2e/hab in the EU-27 in 2018, the level of emission per capita in Albania is 3.5 t CO2e/hab in 2016.</p>
              <p>During this period, emissions have increased only slightly: they amounted to 9,925 kt CO2e in 2009 and to 10,139 kt CO2e in 2016 (+2.2%). During this period, only important variation in terms of emissions is due to exceptional episodes of forest fires in 2011-2012 that are accounted in the FOLU sector.</p>

              <p>This overall national evolution hides discrepancies between individual sectors:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Emissions of the Energy sector amounted to 4,243 kt CO2e in 2009 and to 4,664 kt CO2e in 2016 (+9.9%).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Emissions of the Industrial processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector amounted to 1,356 kt CO2e in 2009 and to 1,020 kt CO2e in 2016 (-24.8%). This decrease is mainly due to a technology switch in the Iron & Steel sector between 2009 (Direct Reduced Iron Production) and 2010 (Electric Arc Furnace).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Emissions of the Waste sector amounted to 621 kt CO2e in 2009 and to 838 kt CO2e in 2016 (+35.1%).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Emissions of the Agriculture sector amounted to 2,239 kt CO2e in 2009 and to 2,344 kt CO2e in 2016 (+4.7%).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Emissions of the Forest and Other Land Use (FOLU) sector amounted to 1,467 kt CO2e in 2009 and to 1,274 kt CO2e in 2016 (-12.4%). Emissions peaks are caused by the effect of exceptional episodes of forest fires in 2011-2012. However, the fuelwood demand is the important driver of FOLU trends in general and is the main reason why the FOLU is not a net carbon sink during the period as CO2 emissions from the combustion of wood are reported under the FOLU sector and not under the energy sector.</p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                  <p>Specific trends per sector are presented on the figure below:</p>

              <h3>2.1.2. 2016 GHG inventory</h3>
              <p>In 2016, according to the national inventory figures from the draft of the first BUR and the 4th National Communication, used as a base for the NDC projections, Albania emitted 10,184 kt CO2e, 46.0% from the Energy sector; 23.1% from the Agriculture sector; 12.6% from the FOLU sector; 10.1% from the IPPU sector and 8.3% from the Waste sector.</p>

          <h2><a>2.2. Projections</a></h2>
              <h3>2.2.1. BAU scenario</h3>
              <p>The NDC relies on the comparison between a Business as Usual scenario (BAU) and a NDC scenario considering mitigation measures. Projections rely on macro-economic assumptions such as GDP and population forecast but also on historical trends, strategies and plans as endorsed at national level. Population is expected to remain constant on the time-series. GDP forecast considered in the assumptions is presented on the figure below.</p>
              <p>Figure 5. Historical data and GDP forecast<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
              <p><img width="551" height="264" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-5.png"></p>
              <p>The BAU scenario relies on current trends and future economic development. It considers the national circumstances such as the current energy poverty. No major technology switch is taken into account. The BAU considers only very small scale improvements for Energy Efficiency (energy efficiency based on technology improvement and fleet renewal) and Renewable energy as well as laws adopted before 2016 (increase of biofuels share in the road transport to reach 10% in 2030) and introduction of imported Natural gas in the country around 2023.</p>
              <p>The NDC scenario takes into account national strategies and action plans as detailed at sectoral level below (<a href="#bookmark18">summary; more details are provided in</a> <a href="#bookmark18">Annex 1. Mitigation calculations (details for</a> sectors)).</p>

              <p><img width="568" height="227" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-6.png"></p>
              <p>Considering all sectors (including FOLU), emissions for the BAU scenario increase from 10,139 kt CO2e in 2016 to 15,148 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of +49.4%.</p>
            </li>

              <h3>NDC scenario</h3>
              <p>The figure below presents the projected evolution of emissions for all sectors according to the NDC scenario. The relative contribution of each sector to the total of emissions remains similar to the situation of the reference year, except for the FOLU sector that has a decreasing impact, due to a higher level of absorption by sinks and a lower level of emissions by sources.</p>
              <p>Figure 7. Evolution of emissions per sector (kt CO2e) according to the NDC scenario</p>
              <p><img width="570" height="227" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-7.png"></p>
              <p>The aggregated effect of mitigation actions is presented in the following figure.</p>
              <p>Considering all sectors (including FOLU), emissions for the NDC scenario (with mitigation measures) increase from 10,139 kt CO2e in 2016 to 11,978 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an increase of +18.1%. The difference, in 2030, with the BAU scenario, is -3,170 kt CO2e, which represents a mitigation impact of -20.9%.</p>
              <p>Overall, the mitigation actions accounted in the NDC scenario could help avoid, in total during the period 2021-2030, 16,828 kt CO2e compared to the BAU scenario. This is the cumulative effect of the emissions reduction between NDC scenario and BAU scenario.</p>

                  <p>Electricity generation has been historically met almost exclusively by hydropower plants, with a total installed power capacity of 2,011 MW at the end of 2016. The country has exploited approximately 50% of its hydropower potential, and future expansion of hydropower capacity is possible mainly along the Drini, Mati, Devolli, and Bistrica rivers. Given that one of the most important natural renewable energy resources for electricity generation in our country is the hydro it is very important that Water Secretariat Responsible for Water Resources Administration should be monitoring all new licenses issued for hydro power plants. Monitoring of water resources should guarantee the protection and preservation of water resources in the country, in accordance with the policies integrated in the field of water resource management.</p>
                  <p>The only thermal power plant, Vlora TPP, is not yet operational, and its conversion to natural gas is foreseen following construction of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). Albania imports electricity from neighboring countries, although imports have progressively dropped in the last ten years following the increase in domestic power generation and the reduction of (technical and non-technical) electricity losses in the distribution system, which have been reduced from 45% in 2013 to 28% by the end of 2016<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> with a clear investment and management plan to reduce them further to 17% by the end of 2022. Albania’s electricity market is under transition from a centrally planned to a market-based system. The wholesale power market is dominated by the state- owned, regulated generation company KESh, which supplies to OSHEE the electricity needed for captive customers under regulated “full supply” condition.

                  <p>(summary; more details are provided in Annex 1. Mitigation calculations (details for sectors)<i>)</i></p>
                  <p>In the Energy sector, consumptions are expected to increase rapidly according to economic development based on current technologies. GHG emissions for the BAU scenario increase from 4,664 kt CO2e in 2016 to 8,466 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of +81.5%.</p>

                  <p>The BAU scenario is based on the most likely evolution of the Albanian energy sector according to the baseline scenario of the National Strategy of Energy approved by the Albanian Government on August 8, 2018 and with no further policy interventions. It was developed accordingly to the National Energy Strategy considering new set of macro-economic drivers such as GDP and population. LEAP was the energy model used for energy demand forecast for baseline and other scenarios for policy makers (see below for further description) taking as base year 2015 and carry out yearly energy demand until 2030.</p>
                  <p>LEAP is a widely used model-building tool for analyzing energy systems in the medium to long term. LEAP is a user-friendly accounting framework that can be used to analyze the integrated energy and environment results of a baseline and alternative scenarios of the energy system as it grows over time. An Albania-LEAP model has been in use since 1997. A basic characteristic of LEAP models is that the calculation of energy demands is based on a “bottom-up” approach with many decentralized data, such as end-use energy intensities, the efficiency and penetration rates of different equipment and the demand for energy services at the residential, commercial, agriculture, industry and transport sectors levels. Given these sectoral demands, LEAP software calculates the demand for primary energy sources, electricity and all other energy commodities. LEAP also calculates a variety of emissions that are generated from the fuels used.</p>
                  <p>Nowadays, the Albanian economy is predominantly based on the service sector. Agriculture has also been one of the most important economic sectors in Albania. Nonetheless, during the last decade the Albanian economy has shifted towards industry and service due to increased urbanization and emigration. Consequently, the service sector is today the largest contributor to GDP, comprising around 60% of the total, followed by agriculture and manufacturing industry. All these factors have been incorporated into the Baseline sectoral demand projections.</p>
                  <p>The main drivers of energy consumption in the residential sector are population and the number of households. Data on the number of persons per household in developed European countries and countries in transition show that household size decreases as the standard of living grows. The decrease occurs due to the aging of the population and the increase in the number of one- member and two-member households. In Albania, the number of persons per household is expected to decrease from 2.92 in 2014 to 2.41 in 2030.</p>
                  <p>To reflect the various climatic zones in Albania, households were categorized into three zones with respect to their heating and cooling demands. Breakdown between zones is done based on the concept of Heating Degree Days according to the Albanian Energy Building Code (approved by the Albanian Council of Ministers in January 2003). Zone 1 is most of the urban centers in coastal area of Albania with heating degree days lower than 1300 °C, Zone 2 with cities with heating degree days higher than 1300 °C and lower than 2300 °C, and Zone 3 is mountainous areas with heating degree days higher than 2300 °C.</p>
                  <p>The basic measure of heating standard in the model is heated area. The heated area of the average household was determined based on statistical data and calibrating with the data from the energy balance. The share of heated area in total living area (load factor) is 31% and is the result of the purchasing ability of the population, the availability of firewood, the price of electricity, and life priorities arising from tradition and cultural heritage. Therefore, with standard growth, the further increase of the share of heated area in a total area of housing units is 70% by 2030.</p>
                  <p>In order to calculate the energy demand, the Service Sector was divided in two branches: Public Service and Private, or Commercial Service. The Public Service Sector is based on the traditional approach to heat demand, mainly using not efficient technologies, installations and organization, although in some recent cases new schemes have been introduced. Commercial Service Sector approach is based on rapid introduction of modern technology, but improvements are needed regarding the efficient utilization. Private Service Sector has inherited some traditional repair-service and small shops/restaurants that have neither possibility nor demand for space heating and air conditioning. Meanwhile, in many services, the private sector has experienced modern and qualitative developments. This service group includes business categories such as hotels, restaurants, banks, tourist agencies, consulting and insurance offices, etc. as well as many parallel services with the public service such as education, culture, health, etc., aiming the maximal comfort. Analysis of the energy demand is based on the general tendency of the previous period. A number of driving factors were taken into consideration as determining factors for the future energy demands. The public service buildings have as a special driving factor the total volume, divided in the heated stock and unheated stock. In order to increase the service quality, improve the working conditions and the comfort for the public administration, was forecasted that until the end of the period 2014-2030, the existing ratio would change in favour of the heated stock in 2030. The GDP growth from the service sector will be accompanied with energy demand increase due to high comfort requirements, the qualitative improvement of the services and changes of the ratio between the urban and rural populations in favour of the former.</p>
                  <p>The structure of the industry sector in Albania shows that three main industrial sectors are consuming the highest share of energy: food, metal and building materials industries. Each of these industries is represented by its final energy consumption of electricity and other fuels. The growth in GDP is the most influential determinant of energy demand in industry. In addition to overall GDP growth, the value-added structure of the GDP drives the energy consumption for the industry and agriculture sectors. In the early development of a society, agriculture contributes a significant share of GDP. GDP from agriculture has been dominant in the past. As the society develops, GDP from the Agriculture sector will increase in absolute terms, but the sectoral share will remain constant in relative terms while the share of industry grows. GDP from the Service sectors will increase in absolute terms. In developed economies the dominant GDP share belongs to services, followed by industry and then agriculture. The growth in GDP is the most influential determinant of energy demand in industry. For this analysis, given that little structural changes are anticipated in the near-future, the expected contribution from agriculture is expected to remain constant at 22.7%, while the contribution from the overall industry sector to be increased from 14.9% (2014) up to 25% at 2030.</p>
                  <p>The Transport Sector is the largest energy consuming sector in Albania and plays an important role in the consumption of energy resources. After 1990, there was a significant increase in the number of the transport modes, especially for road transport, which lead to a significant increase of transport activity and fuel consumption, mainly diesel and gasoline. In order to calculate the future transport energy demand, the sector was divided in two sub sectors: transport of freight and passengers. For the transport sector, two main indicators measure the demand for passenger and freight transport: passenger-km and ton-km. It is forecasted that ton-km will increase by 85% in 2030 compared to 2014, while passenger-km will increase by 37%. The vast majority of transport is undertaken by road vehicles. Albania’s transport sector has been increasing rapidly since 2000. The number of vehicles in circulation has increased and infrastructure is being improved, which leads to an ever-increasing total traffic load. The transport sector consumes significant quantities of energy (mostly in the form of diesel and gasoline).</p>
                  <p>Albania will continue to remain for many years a country where the agriculture dominates. The income increase from the agricultural production, livestock, agro-industry, fishing and forestry remains the main alternative for the economic and social development of the country. The development of the agriculture sector is conditioned by many factors where the most important are: Farms are of minimal sizes and fragmented; Problems exist over arable land property rights; Farm inputs have very high prices and the distribution system for agricultural production is unorganized and inefficient; There is a lack of available agriculture crediting, and Agricultural production is insufficiently mechanized. The organisation of farms brings energy savings in the NDC scenario.</p>
                  <h4>2.2.3.1. Energy NDC scenario</h4>
                  <p>The analysis of the Albanian Energy Sector was performed using the Albania-LEAP model results adjusted according to the latest development of the period 2014-2020, a proven tool used previously by the Albanian Government and commonly used by other countries in the region and globally. The analytical results provided quantitative metrics for assessing the likely outcomes of possible energy scenarios against the goals of this strategy.</p>
                  <p>Establishment of the NDC scenario for Energy Sector was based mainly on the Albania’s Energy Sector Strategy, which is harmonized in terms of goals, energy sector details and timeline with a number of other strategic and legal documents that are in force, adopted or drafted in the same time frame as this document. Building on and complementing these documents has led to synergies in the prioritization of policies and programs and in the development of strategic recommendations. The National Strategy for the Energy Sector (2017-2030) is aligned with the following key documents:</p>

                      <p>Achieving the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                      <p>To understand the costs and benefits of these possible policies, the following four other scenarios were developed and analyzed using the Albania-LEAP model.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Energy Efficiency (EE):</strong> This scenario assumes that Albania meets its Energy Community Treaty commitments by implementing the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and enforceing the Law on Energy Efficiency (together with improvement of the Law to transpose EED requirements) and the Law on Energy Performance in Buildings. EE target for 2030 has been defined to be 15%.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Renewable Energy Sources (RES):</strong> Assumes that Albania meets its Energy Community Treaty commitments of reaching a 38% renewable energy target in 2020 by implementing the Albanian National Renewable Energy Action Plan. RES target for 2030 has been defined to be 42.5%.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Natural Gas Promotion:</strong> Assumes maximum possible penetration of natural gas in line with the Gas Master Plan. Natural gas penetration rate of penetration target for 2030 has been defined to be 8-10% (National Natural Gas Master Plan). Natural gas in Albania will be mostly for guaranteeing the security of electricity supply since Albanian power sector is 100% based on the hydro resources and in electricity import.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Combined:</strong> Combines the EE, RES and Natural Gas Promotion scenarios. Under this scenario all above mentioned targets have been aggregated and guaranteeing so proper development scenario for development of energy sector until 2030.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The Energy sector NDC scenario is based on Combined – Strategy scenario calibrated with real figures for the period 2015-2019. The NDC scenario takes into account the introduction of natural gas in almost all sectors (including energy industry, manufacturing industry, transport, commercial, residential and agriculture). It also considers the implementation of the different National Energy Efficiencies Actions Plans (NEEAP) to increase energy efficiencies in both supply and demand reaching a 15% gain in 2030. It also takes into account the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) with objectives of a share of 38% of renewables in the final energy consumption in 2020 (already almost reached in 2019) and 42% in 2030.</p>
                  <p>Emissions for the NDC scenario (with mitigation measures) increase from 4,664 kt CO2e in 2016 to 6,544 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of +40.3%. The difference, in 2030, with the BAU scenario, is -1,921 kt CO2e representing a mitigation impact of -22.7%.</p>

                  <h4>2.2.4.1. Overview of the IPPU sector</h4>
                  <p>Almost 90% of GHG emissions from industrial processes depends on the cement production. Emissions from energy consumption in the manufacturing industry are considered under the Energy sector presented above.</p>
                  <h4>2.2.4.2. IPPU BAU scenario</h4>
                  <p>In the IPPU sector, emissions for the BAU scenario increase from 1,020 kt CO2e in 2016 to 1,854 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of +81.9%. The BAU scenario is based on the GDP trend for all sub-sectors (as considered in the GHG inventory) of the manufacturing industry except for F-gases. For F-gases, emissions are based on a model considering imports, bank, equipment market, refrigerant market share, equipment production, average characteristics of equipment. Albania has ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, in 2019. The impact is considered in the BAU. In 2030, HFCs are expected to represent about 16% of IPPU CO2e emissions.</p>

                  <h4>2.2.4.1. IPPU NDC scenario</h4>
                  <p>For the IPPU sector, no additional Policies & Measure are considered. Impact of energy efficiency (EE) or fuel switch measures in the industry are taken into account in the Energy sector. BAU and NDC scenarios are therefore identical.</p>

              <h3>2.2.5. Waste</h3>
                  <h4>2.2.5.1. Overview of the waste sector</h4>
                  <p>GHG emissions of the waste sector are mainly due to landfills (in 2016, CH4 emissions from landfills represented almost 80% of total waste emissions). The waste degradation being subject to a kinetics, this induces a gap between the maximum of buried waste and the peak of emissions observed.</p>
                  <p>The second sub-sector in terms of emissions is the wastewater treatment because of N2O emissions.</p>
                  <p>In Albania, urban solid waste collection systems are in place in most cities. Little recycling of waste is undertaken. The principal method of disposal is dumping. There are no collection systems in rural areas and small towns. Most of the waste from these areas is disposed of by dumping in ditches, ravines, or at the side of roads where it is washed and blown onto other land and ultimately into water courses.</p>
                  <p>There are some landfills already functioning in 2010 (Tirana and Shkoder Region), while the others remained at the project level (new landfills of Korce, Pogradec, Sarande, Vlore, and Durres).</p>
                  <p>Except for Kavaja and Pogradec wastewater treatment plants, there are no other wastewater treatment facilities in the country. These two facilities are relatively small to make a difference and almost all used water is discharged untreated to water bodies.</p>
                  <p>Albania started the construction of 3 incinerators of urban waste in Elbasan, Tirana and Fier. The first one entered in operation in 2017 to perform tests and all the incinerators should be operational in 2023. There is no segregated waste collection system in place yet, which is required by law since several years now. In the country, there are established waste recycling industries mainly for plastics and metals.</p>
                  <h4>2.2.5.2. Waste BAU scenario</h4>
                  <p>In the Waste sector, emissions for the BAU scenario increase from 838 kt CO2e in 2016 to 966 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of +15,3%.</p>
                  <p>Figure 17. Projected waste-related emissions</p>
                  <p><img width="593" height="166" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-19.png"></p>
                  <p>The BAU scenario assumes a stable level of waste produced per year and per capita, a stable ratio of waste going to landfill, no methane capture installation; an amount of composted, of incinerated and of open burnt waste per inhabitant equal to the mean value of the three recent years and evolves with the population trend. The wastewater treatment forecast is based on industrial production trend (more details are provided in Annex 1. Mitigation calculations (details for sectors)).</p>
                  <h4>2.2.5.3. Waste NDC scenario</h4>
                  <p>In the Waste sector, emissions for the NDC scenario increase from 838 kt CO2e in 2016 to 959 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of +14.5%. The difference, in 2030, with the BAU scenario, is -7 kt CO2e, which represents a mitigation impact of -0.7%.</p>
                  <p>The small difference observed between the 2 scenarios can be partly explained by the degradation kinetics of the waste sent to landfills. In fact, this kinetics induces a gap between the maximum of buried waste (960 kt in 2010) and the emission peak observed (728 kt CO2e in 2024).</p>
                  <p>In parallel, a strong increase of emissions associated with the development of waste incinerators in the country is considered.</p>

              <h3>2.2.6. Agriculture</h3>
                  <h4>2.2.6.1. Overview of the Agriculture sector</h4>
                  <p>Agriculture emissions are mostly driven by the livestock population. The main sources of emissions are methane emissions from enteric fermentation and from manure management. Historical data about livestock population is available, for the period 2009 to 2016, from the national inventory; and for the period 2017 to 2019, from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The decreasing emissions between 2016 and 2020 comes from these data sources.</p>
                  <p>Figure 19. Share of emission sources of the agriculture sector (2016)</p>
                  <p><img width="274" height="212" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-21.png"></p>
                  <h4>2.2.6.2. Agriculture BAU scenario</h4>
                  <p>The trend between 2019 and 2030 is based on an interpolation between 2030 values used in Albania’s Third National Communication (TNC) and the FAO values from 2019. The assumption from the TNC is an increase in most of the livestock populations (except for sheep, goats, horses, mule and asses) in line with the objective of promoting the Albanian agricultural production. It is assumed a constant animals’ feeding and associated productivity, and a constant distribution of animals per manure management systems. For the calculation of nitrogen from crop residues, the analysis considers stable areas per types of crops, except for wheat, which is decreasing, and makes hypothesis regarding the increasing evolution of the average yield of these crops. The mineral fertilization projection is based on the evolution of area of total cropland (in line with FOLU sector), assuming that the average nitrogen rate is constant for the BAU scenario. Assumptions of stability have been made regarding other nitrogen inputs. The area of histosols is assumed stable. For crop residues burning, data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) are taken into account for the period 2009-2018. Average rate of burning for wheat during this know period (2009-2018) equals 1.3% and is maintained for the whole period (2019-2030). For pasture burning, the average area burnt for 2009-2018 (5,154 ha) has been used for projected years more details are provided in Annex 1. Mitigation calculations (details for sectors)).</p>
                  <p>In the Agriculture sector, emissions for the BAU scenario decrease from 2,344 kt CO2e in 2016 to 2,140 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of -8.7%. However, the decreases from 2016 to 2019 is given through FAO datasets, and the projection for BAU considers a small increase from 2020 to 2030, in line with livestock population projected for the TNC.</p>
                  <p>Figure 20. Projected agriculture-related emissions</p>
                  <p>Agriculture</p>
                  <p><img width="360" height="23" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-22.png"></p>
                  <h4>2.2.6.3. Agriculture NDC scenario</h4>
                  <p>As for the BAU scenario, the decreases from 2016 to 2019 is based on FAO datasets, and the projection considers a small increase from 2020 to 2030, in line with livestock population projected in the TNC. Additional mitigation measures considered in Agriculture allow an improvement of fertilization, pasture, and animal feeding practices (see table 3.). However, these actions have little impact considering the importance of livestock population in the emissions. In line with the national strategy, and considering the national economic circumstances, the aim is an increase in production, no decrease of livestock population, and an increase in yields.</p>
                  <p>This explains that emissions for the NDC scenario for this sector (with mitigation measures) decrease from 2,344 kt CO2e in 2016 to 2,071 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of -11.6%. The difference, in 2030, with the BAU scenario, is -68 kt CO2e, which represents a limited mitigation impact of -3.2%.</p>

              <h3>2.2.7. FOLU</h3>
                  <h4>2.2.7.1. Overview of the FOLU sector</h4>
                  <p>In the FOLU sector, emissions (mainly carbon losses from the harvest of fuelwood, wood, and forest fires) are bigger than absorptions (the growth of forest biomass). Therefore, this sector does not represent a net sink. During the historical period, fuelwood harvested quantities did not vary much (around 1 million m3/y), and forest growth remained stable. On the other hand, there is a large magnitude of variation for forest fires, with one peak in 2011-2012 and another in 2017<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. While the main driver of the sector and for the projections remains the forest, agricultural land also presents mitigation potential that has been taken into account.</p>
                  <h4>2.2.7.2. FOLU BAU scenario</h4>
                  <p>The BAU scenario for FOLU sector considers the continuation of the situation and trends of the recent decade covered by the inventory, in particular in terms of trends for land-use change areas, wood and fuelwood harvests (stable, as in the 2009-2016 period). For wildfires, EFFIS data is used for 2017-2018, and it explains the second peak in 2017. Forest fires episodes, which happen at irregular times, cannot be projected: only a background level was projected, based on the whole period without considering exceptional episodes. it is assumed an increasing probability of fires for this background level, with a linear increase (<a href="#bookmark18">more details are provided in Annex 1.</a> <a href="#bookmark18">Mitigation calculations (details for</a> sectors)).</p>
                  <p>In the FOLU sector, emissions for the BAU scenario increase from 1,319 kt CO2e in 2016 to 1,772 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of +34.3%.</p>

                  <h4>2.2.7.3. FOLU NDC scenario</h4>
                  <p>In the FOLU sector, emissions for the NDC scenario (with mitigation measures) decrease from 1,319 kt CO2e in 2016 to 598 kt CO2e in 2030, which represents an evolution of -54.7%. The difference, in 2030, with the BAU scenario, is -1,174 kt CO2e, which represents a mitigation impact of -66.2%. As for the NDC scenario, big forest fires episodes caused the two peaks (2011-2012 and 2017) and such episodes could not be projected. However, it is considered, in line with the national policy (Draft Environmental Cross-cutting Strategy), that an effort is put to avoid such episodes through the improvement of the monitoring system to prevent wildfires. In addition to this action regarding the prevention of wildfires, other mitigation measures are considered in the NDC scenario: the diminution of the use of fuelwood (the assumption on fuelwood consumption being estimated in the Energy sector, so that FOLU and Energy sectors are consistent); new afforestation areas; improved efficiency of fuelwood harvest; improved sustainable management of forests, cropland and grassland to enhance carbon sequestration and protect biodiversity.</p>

      <h1>3. ADAPTATION</h1>
      <p>The projected changes in temperature, rainfall and sea-level (see section 4.2 below) will affect every Albanian region and every socio-economic sector in a specific way, depending on its own characteristics. On adaptation, this document focuses on the Albanian coastal area and the capital Tirana, which comprises a significant proportion of the population, as well as key infrastructure and is the main touristic destination in the country. Indeed, while within the Albanian coast climate change will affect every socio-economic sector, on adaptation this document focuses on settlements, populations and tourism. More specifically, on settlements the document considers the infrastructure and the built environment, water and energy; on populations, it considers lives and livelihoods and health; and on tourism, it considers changes in the touristic season and the touristic conditions. In addition, the Albanian agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector is analysed in great detail.</p>
      <p>Building on section 1 on national circumstances, this section on adaptation is structured in the following way. Section 4.1 introduces the Albanian coast and agriculture. Section 4.2 presents climate variability and change in Albania regarding temperature, precipitation and sea level rise. Section 4.3 analyses climate risks, impacts and vulnerability for the four priority sectors, namely settlements, populations, tourism and AFOLU. Finally, section 4.4 categorizes and prioritizes climate change adaptation measures.</p>

              <h3>3.1.1.The Albanian Coast</h3>
                  <h4>3.1.1.1. Overview</h4>
                  <p>The main part of the coastal area (the Adriatic coast and the most southern part of the Ionian coast –that belong to the Zone A in Map 1) is located in the Mediterranean field climatic Zone. The other part of the Ionian coast, in Zone B in Map 2, belongs to the Mediterranean Southern Mountainous climatic Subzone. Overall, the coast is warmer than the interior of the country. In the coastal area, maximum temperatures average 21.8°C in the summer and 14.6°C in the winter.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The centre of the coast gets less rain than the North and the Southwest (with the Southeast being the least rainy).</p>
                  <p>Albanian coasts are rich with sandy and rocky shores and include important ecosystems. Although the number of protected areas in the coast has increased over the years (there are currently eleven protected areas including a marine protected area), the coastal ecosystems are still facing significant risks and pressures, including:</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Deficiencies in waste management (waste from tourism facilities is reaching the coastal waters, and plastic litter accounts for more than 90% of the total solid waste found on beaches);</p>

                      <p>Climate change impacts, which are further described in section 4.3 below.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                      <p>According to the Integrated cross-sectoral plan for the coastal belt, coastal rivers are significantly polluted: water quality was poor or bad in 45% of the 22 water quality monitoring stations in the coast.</p>
                  <h4>3.1.1.2. Coastal settlements & demography</h4>
                  <p>The coastal region occupies 36.7% of the surface area of the country and has 39.3% of the population. The Integrated cross-sectoral plan for the coastal belt (ICSP) identifies the four following coastal spatial belts, as shown in <strong>Error! Reference source not found.</strong> below:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>The first belt, Zone A, is characterised by its urban development and tourism infrastructure and is known as “sun-sea belt”. The cities composing this zone are Durres, Vlora, Lezha, Saranda, Velipoja, Himara, Ksamili and Divjaka. Although technically not a coastal city, Tirana is sometimes considered as such, given its proximity to the coastline and the functional links with coastal city of Durres, which constitutes the main port of the country. The Tirana – Durres region comprises 8.4% of the territory and accommodates 37% of the country’s population. In 2015, this region generated 48% of the national GDP and represented the region with the highest income per capita, which is 1.32 times more than the national average.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>The second belt, Zone B, can be defined as the agricultural belt, includes vast field areas and low hills, and is composed of cities of secondary importance regarding the coastline (such as Shkodra, Fushe-Kruja, Tirana, Kavaja, Lushnja, Fieri and other smaller areas). Agricultural land represents 24% of the coastal territory. Farmers traditionally produce vegetables, potatoes, and fruits (olives, citrus, grape vines, etc). In some areas, production is possible all year long.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>The third belt, Zone C, includes cities and residences that are more in depth of the territory, that have important cultural, heritage, folkloric, polyphonic, music, arts values. Cities of this zone are Kruja, Elbasan, Berat, Tepelena, Permet and Gjirokastra; and</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>The fourth belt, Zone D, which is the maritime space. rich in flora and fauna, underwater resources of the bottom of the sea, including beaches, ports and their terrestrial territories, lagoons, estuaries, lakes, water, which communicate with the sea.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><img width="394" height="580" alt="Map Description automatically generated" src="img/ALB-NDC1-25.png"></p>
                  <p>Source: Integrated Cross-sectorial Plan for the Coast, NATP, 2015</p>
                  <p>The coastal zone has faced a chaotic development since the 1990s following an important immigration from the rest of the country (east to west). The coastal population density increased significantly for the last 2 decades, with about 1 million more residents in the period. This development resulted in many challenges including unemployment and poverty in rural areas; overpopulation in and expansion of coastal cities; habitation development conflicting with common urban, natural and cultural areas and with agricultural land; weak transport, water, sanitation and energy infrastructures; and limited provision of/access to services.</p>
                  <p>Currently, water supply is available in almost 80% of the urban areas and 50% in the rural areas (national level). Wastewater coverage is approximately 80% for the urban areas and 10% for the rural ones. At the national level, all energy supply is from hydropower, which covers 80 to 90% of the internal demand for energy, with 95% from 6 plants. However, 40% of the energy is lost in the distribution network, because of distance and poor state of the infrastructure. Only 35.4% of the hydro potential is being used, and the potential for solar energy and others is not yet exploited.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
                  <h4>3.1.1.3. Tourism</h4>
                  <p>According to the National Tourism Strategy (2019), in 2017 tourism directly contributed to 8.5% of the GDP (2017), and indirectly (multiplier effects) to 26.2%. It is growing and is projected to reach 9.3% of GDP by 2028. It employed 7.7% of total labour force in 2017, and possibly 8.8% by 2028<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. The different tourism locations along the coast are illustrated in Map 3 in Annex 2. Adaptation</p>
                  <p>Tourism is however an underdeveloped sector in Albania in view of its potential, hindered by its limited infrastructure and accommodation capacities, standards and quality of services, tourism offer and products, and cooperation and coordination among the players who are or could be an integral part of the industry.</p>
                  <p>Being dependent from summer tourism (starting from June-July, with a maximum number of visitors achieved in August and with an immediate decline in September), the majority of hotels and accommodations in the coastal areas are faced with seasonal functioning difficulties and as such, the phenomena of seasonal migration of habitants of coastal areas, especially in the South regions, is still evident.</p>
                  <p>Even though archaeology and cultural heritage is not the main drive to attract foreign or domestic visitors, these are identified as priorities in developing the tourism sector in the country and the coastal zone<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>
              <h3>3.1.2. AFOLU</h3>
              <p>Crops</p>
              <p>Agriculture accounts for about one-fifth of the gross domestic product. 50% of rural population is engaged in agriculture. The agriculture sector is dominated by small and family farms, with an average farm size of about 1.2 ha. A high level of agricultural land fragmentation remains one of the major challenges in the sector.</p>
              <p>The climatic conditions of the country allow the cultivation of cereals, fruits, vegetables, and fodder crops. About 35% of the arable land is cultivated for cereals, 8 % for vegetables, 50% for fodder crops and 7 % for other types of plants. In the last ten years the area under wheat has decreased by about 22% and the average yield stayed at the same level. The yields of maize, vegetables, fodder, fruits and grapes have increased by 8-12%.</p>
              <p>Despite the favourable climatic conditions and abundant water resources, the crops sector in Albania remains relatively underdeveloped and faces a number of challenges, including low productivity; limited area of cultivation; highly fragmented land ownership; low level of mechanization; negative climate impacts, especially flood and drought conditions; and low level of phytosanitary controls that limits agricultural export.</p>
              <p>Livestock</p>
              <p>Livestock production contributes more than 50% of the agriculture production value. Within the livestock sector, the primary output is cow milk followed by bovine meat. With regard to milk and dairy products in Albania is almost self-sufficient (at the level of 95%), while the eggs production has a surplus and eggs are exported to Italy, Croatia and Kosovo. At the same time, about 40% of meat consumed is imported. Livestock population is differently distributed across the country: in the lowland areas, cattle are the dominant livestock type, while in hilly and mountainous areas, small ruminants (sheep and goats) dominate. From 1997 to 2019 the number of ruminant species has declined, and the population of swine and poultry remained almost stable.</p>
              <p>The barriers towards more efficient livestock sector include small farm size; land fragmentation; broken rolling relief; poor infrastructure; limited availability of rural credit to farmers, processors and other small rural businesses; and inadequate rural institutions, especially extension services.</p>
              <p>Forests</p>
              <p>Forests cover around 36% of the land area in Albania with “high” forests covering 32.4%, coppice 46.2% and shrubs 21.4% of the forest area. The total forest area has declined since 1938, from</p>
              <p>1.385 million hectares to 1.051 million hectares in 2018. During the last decades, forests have experienced significant changes in their area and standing volume. During 2007-2019, the forest volume was reduced from 73.641 million cubic meters in 2009 to 57.7 million in 2018 or by 22%. The main negative factors are a lack of forest management capacity, illegal logging, and forest fires. During 2007-2019 about 337,800 ha of forests were burned, which constitutes around 33% of the national forest area. Almost all the forest fires have anthropogenic origin. Also, such species as black pine, chestnut, plane, oaks and box-tree are suffering from the damages caused by diseases and pests.</p>
              <p>Firewood is an important commodity for Albania because it is used for heating many households. In rural areas it is also used for cooking and water heating. Albanian forests have uneven age structure with predominantly young stands, which leaves limited timber volume to harvest. There are some limited areas of old-growth forests (mainly beech), but they are part of protected areas, where harvesting is prohibited. The Albanian forest age is relatively young and there is a strong need for improved forest management.</p>
              <p>Currently, 96% of the forest is owned by municipalities and the National Agency of Protected Areas and the rest is privately owned. In 2016, the Government of Albania transferred forest management (except protected areas) to 61 municipalities. Also, since 2016 there is a moratorium on forest harvesting with exception of harvesting by local governments to meet the needs of households and large public building users.</p>
              <p>Pastures and Meadows</p>
              <p>Pastures are defined as areas larger than 0.5 ha with herbaceous and dwarf species. The total pasture area in Albania is about 480,800 ha. The pasture area per capita varies widely among the districts from 0.009 ha/capita for Durres to 0.83 for Kolonje. About 50% of the pastures are owned by private individuals, about 44% by the state and only 6 % by local communities. There are about 60% summer pastures and 40% are winter pastures. The vast majority of the pastures are natural pastures; only a single pasture is defined as cultivated. A high percentage of the pastures are located on steep or very steep slopes (almost 80%) and only about 20% are on undulating terrain, posing some limitation on the management of the pasture resources. Most of the pasture areas show erosion signs with about 60% overutilized. About 50% of the pastures are at an altitude of less than 1000m, 50% are above 1000m. The grazing intensity has a definite influence on the sustainability of grazing, depending on carrying capacity and pasture conditions. More than 73% of the pastures are grazed moderately and 23% -- are being grazed heavily. Water supply is important for providing drinking water for the animals. Only 25% of pastures have a water source closer than 1 km, for almost 30% the closest water supply is more than 3 km away.</p>
              <p>Lagoons and Wetlands</p>
              <p>Wetlands and lagoons are an important element of Albania’s ecosystem diversity. Most of them are located along the coastal area of Adriatic and Ionian seas (Viluni, Kune Vain, Patok, Karavasta, Narta Orikum and Butriknti lagoons), as well as along the big lakes (Prespa, Ohrid and Shkodra Lakes). Many lagoons and wetlands a part of the Protected Areas Network, which covers 524,322.70 ha, or 18.24% of the total territory.</p>
              <p>Albania has four Ramsar sites: “Lagoon of Karavastasë-Pisha e Divjakës”, “Kanali i Çukës- Butrint-Kepi i Stillos”, “Lake Shkodra-Buna river”, “Lake of Prespa” with a total of 98180 ha. In Adriatic coast Divjaka and Karavasta lagoons are located, comprising the most important protected area along the Albania’s coastal space. The Karavasta Lagoon ranks among the lagoons of great importance providing habitat of over 20,000 wintering birds. The lagoon is known for the large colony of the curly pelican (Pelecanus crispus), the only coastal nesting point of Albania. Uncontrolled hunting remains the major risk factor for rare birds. Periodic hunting ban has led to a noticeable increase of the colony of pelicans, even flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) in Narta and Kune Vain. Coastal waters and lagoons as well as freshwater ecosystems have additional economic value as recreational fishing and hunting spots.</p>
              <p>Aquaculture and Fisheries</p>
              <p>Albania is rich in water resources, with a coastline of 476 km, where fishing activities take place in the 12 miles zone. Fishing activities are mainly concentrated on the continental shelf (on the Adriatic side in the north extends to 25 miles and 2–4 miles in the Ionian Sea). There is a gradual increasing trend of the average annual per capita consumption of fisheries and aquaculture products from 4.9 kg/year in 2010 to 5.3 kg/year in 2016. Today fisheries (including capture fisheries and aquatic organisms farming) take an important place in the Albanian economy, even though the contribution of the sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is relatively low (0.3%).</p>
              <p>The sector has a good growth potential to be exploited through formulation and adoption of appropriate policies sustained by efficient investments. Marine fisheries (represented by Large Scale Fisheries - LSF) provide more than 52% of the catch and 61% of the value with coastal areas, lagoons and inland waters (Small Scale Fisheries – SSF) yielding respectively 21% of the production, but only 13% of the value. The aquaculture sectors have been increasing in importance with 27% of the production and 26% of the value. The total full-time employment in the fisheries and aquaculture sector is estimated at more than 4200 persons with a significant number of women employed by the processing industry and ancillary services. The fish processing industry is represented by almost 20 companies involved in processing seafood mainly for the EU markets. The export of fish and seafood is quadrupling in comparison to 2013, while for instance in 2019 the value of Albanian fish exports reached 100 million euros and during the first six months of 2020, it was recorded a further increase of 24.5%. The development of the aquaculture sector has followed the domestic consumer demand, especially for marine finfish products. Nevertheless, the import of marine aquaculture products (European sea bass and gilthead sea bream) is still insufficient to cover the domestic demand. The main problems faced by aquaculture sector are related to a lack of national inputs. For instance, the fish feed is mainly imported from Italy, France, Germany and Turkey.</p>
          <h2><a>3.2. Climate variability and change</a></h2>
          <p>The climate change projections presented in this document are based on a set of scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for their Fifth Assessment Report (AR5, 2014) using data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMPI5). The four scenarios used are called the “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs) and are based on different emission pathways. This goes from RCP2.6 which assumes a peak of 490 parts per million (PPM) CO2 equivalent before 2100 (followed by a decline), which corresponds to what is known as the “2°C world”, to RCP 8.5, which involves more than 1370 PPM CO2 equivalent by 2100 and continued increase, also known as the “4°C world”. The reference period for the projections is 1986-2005.</p>

              <h3>3.2.1. Temperature</h3>
              <p>Temperature records since 1901 indicate that average yearly temperatures for Albania remained between 11 and 12°C for most of the century. Since 1998, the rolling average has remained above 12°C, and is in a clear increasing path, with 2016 average at 12.72°C.</p>
              <p>Projected trends indicate that the <strong>mean annual temperature in Albania will increase</strong> between 1.3°C and 2.2 °C by 2050 and between 1.2°C and 4.4°C by 2100 from the 1986-2005 baseline of 11.8°C.

Reference source not found.</strong> below, in summer months, maximum temperatures would increase between 1.5°C (RCP 2.6) and 6.4°C (RCP 8.5) by 2100. In winter months, minimum temperatures could increase between 0.9°C (RCP 2.6) and 3.8°C (RCP 8.5). The mean summer temperature in coastal areas could therefore be above 25°C by 2050 and around 30°C by 2100.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

              <p>The <strong>frequency of extremely high temperatures is expected to increase</strong>, as a significant decrease in return periods for maximum temperatures is also projected, meaning that temperatures of 38.1°C that occurred every 100 years in Tirana would be occurring every 9.2 years (RCP 2.6) or 3.6 years (RCP 8.5). In Fier (centre), the return period for 3 consecutive days with extreme temperatures above 40.5°C is expected to decrease from once every 30 years (approx.) to once every 6 to 8 years. Inversely, the return periods for extremely low temperatures is expected to increase. In Lezhe (North), average annual maximum temperatures are projected to increase from 29°C to 31°C (RCP 2.6) to 37°C (RCP 8.5) by 2100<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>
              <p>An increase in the number of tropical nights (&gt;20°C) is also projected, from a median of 1.3 tropical night/year between 1986 and 2005 to between 10 (RCP 2.6) and 70 (RCP 8.5) by 2100<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>
              <p>As a consequence, the number and duration of heat waves is expected to increase. As illustrated in <strong>Error! Reference source not found.</strong>, the Warm Spell Duration Index, which measures uninterrupted sequences of six days with temperatures above the 95th percentile of the 1986- 2005 baseline, is expected to increase significantly by 2050 according to all scenarios, with a median between 20 and 41 days, up from 2.5 days.</p>
              <h3>3.2.2. Precipitation</h3>
              <p>Mean precipitation levels have remained relatively stable since 1901, although with a slight decreasing trend. By 2050, precipitation for Albania is expected to decrease between 2.1% (RCP 2.6) and 4.3% (RCP 8.5) from the 1986-2005 baseline of 929.7 mm. By 2100, in a 2°C world, precipitation would have decreased by 1.8% (less than by 2050), while under a 4°C world, it would have decreased by 12.2%.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
              <p>Annual precipitation in coastal Albania is expected to decrease between 1.6 to 2.9% by 2050, and by 1.6 to 7.1% by 2100. Precipitation is expected to decrease the most during summer months (8.7 to 38.1% by 2100). However, precipitation would increase during winter months, between 1.8 to 3.2% by 2050 and between 1.8 to 7.8% by 2100. Combined with warmer temperatures, this increase means that more precipitation will be in the form of rain rather than snow, causing <strong>river flows to increase in the winter and decrease in the spring, summer and fall</strong>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
              <p>Variability of precipitation is expected to increase in the Albanian coastal area, with an increased frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events. Return periods for such events are expected to decrease (all scenarios), with events involving rainfall of 161 mm that occur every 100 years expected to occur every 60 to 75 years in Tirana. <strong>These could cause floods, especially during fall, winter and spring months.</strong></p>
              <p>During summer months, the combined increase in heavy rainfall events and the decrease in rainfall averages indicate that <strong>the frequency of droughts is projected to increase</strong>. For Albania, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which considers changes in the mean of 12-month cumulative water balance, taking into account evapotranspiration, is expected to decrease by a median of 0.34 to 2.08 by 2100, indicating negative and worsening water balance conditions, especially in the South of the country (<strong>Error! Reference source not found.</strong>).<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

              <h3>3.2.3. Sea-level rise (SLR)</h3>
              <p>Global mean sea level is rising increasingly fast as a result of climate change. Sea level anomalies registered since 1993 reveal a trend for an increase in sea level for the coast of Albania. SLR projections for the whole Albanian coast are not available. Projections for the Drini- Mati River Delta (North) indicate that sea level could increase anywhere from 45 cm (RCP 2.6) to 60 cm (RCP 8.5) by 2100, while projections for the Vjosa basin (South) indicate increases between 25 and 105 cm by 2100. Globally, there is medium confidence that an increase by 2°C of global temperatures would lead to an increase of 0.3 to 1.00 m of the global mean sea level relative to 1986-2005. By 2100, 70% of coastlines worldwide should experience SLR within +/- 20% of the global range.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

              <p>Infrastructure and built environment</p>
              <p>Projected changes in precipitation patterns during winter, fall and spring months increase the risk of river floods. In the Seman-Vjosa area (Vjosa basin), embankments and pumping stations installed to prevent floods have already been overcome in recent years, causing catastrophic damages to settlements.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Due to their flatness, coastal areas are not only vulnerable to the projected increased floods from rivers, but also those from storm surges due to SLR. The size and magnitude of floods and of erosion of coastal areas are expected to increase, affecting disproportionately beaches, river mouths and lagoons<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and causing landslides. According to the FNC, shoreline could regress between 7.5 and 15m by 2100. In the Vjosa mouth, coastal erosion will be enhanced by the interruption of the supply of fine sediments from the river, once (and if) the projected hydroelectric dams are constructed upstream.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

The Adriatic coast, and the Drini and Mati River Delta in particular are identified as “critically vulnerable” to climate change.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
                  <p>Coastal infrastructure is made vulnerable. The population growth in coastal cities has increasing number of people “living in poor-quality, highly exposed housing in disaster-prone areas”. In addition to this uncontrolled urbanization, other factors contribute to infrastructure vulnerability, including landscape degradation, uncontrolled modifications to river beds, water, air and land pollution, etc.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The ICSP identifies a number of coastal municipalities that are already considered as “endangered areas” because of coastal erosion, coastal and/or river floods, saltwater intrusion, or landslides. Climate change will worsen these risks.</p>
                  <p>In Tirana, transport, electricity, and water supply infrastructure as well as small scale industry are highly vulnerable to heavy precipitation and floods.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

                  <p>Water</p>
                  <p>Water supply infrastructure is among at-risk infrastructure from climate change, as floods and storm surges could affect the existing network and treatment plants. Furthermore, SLR is projected to increase the water level of rivers, flooding riversides and increasing salinization of coastal aquifers. While water availability has not been an issue in Albania due to its ample freshwater reserves, salinization of coastal aquifers adds on to water losses in the water supply system (due to its maintenance state).</p>
                  <p>Projected increases in temperature will lead to increased evaporation, especially in the summer which is when temperature increases the most. Water availability will be further affected by the projected decrease in precipitation projected to be strongest during summer months, resulting in decreased river runoff. As an example, in the Vjosa basin, annual runoff is expected to decrease between 3.4% (RCP 2.6) and 10.9% (RCP 8.5) by 2050 and between 3.15% (RCP 2.6) and 13.5% (RCP 8.5) by 2100. Runoff decrease is expected to be more important for other river basins.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
                  <p>On the other hand, water demand is expected to increase. This is largely related to increased access to water supply and increase in personal use of water for well-being, as well as challenges to water governance.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Although the marginal effect of climate change is difficult to project, heat waves and droughts are likely to lead to high peaks in demand.</p>
                  <p>Projections for the Vjosa River Basin indicate that during drought periods in the months of July, August, and September, under RCP 8.5, there could be an unmet demand between 3 and 4.5 million m3 per year by 2050.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
                  <p>Energy</p>
                  <p>Given the high reliance of the country on hydropower and the poor state of related infrastructure, the energy supply is vulnerable to climate change. The ICSP states that “seasonal fluctuations can have a negative effect in securing energy supply from these hydro power stations”, mentioning that “in the recent years, the water levels in reservoirs have sometimes been very low levelled, forcing the domestic operators to purchase energy from neighbour countries to cope with the need for energy supply.”</p>
                  <p>The projected decrease in annual river runoff will worsen this situation. Indeed, the National Climate Change Policy (2019) estimates that “by 2050, annual average electricity output from Albania’s large hydropower plants could be reduced by about 15% and from small hydropower plants by around 20%”. Even the projected new dams in Poçem on the Vjosa river will have to address significant streamflow reductions in the summer months, and moderate yearly streamflow reductions.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
                  <p>Hydroelectricity infrastructure could also be damaged during heavy rainfall events, which tend to cause unusually high amounts of sediments to flow into the rivers and dams.</p>
                  <p>On the demand side, increased temperatures will cause an overall increase in cooling degree days between May and September, which will reflect on higher demand for electricity. <strong>Error! Reference source not found.</strong> illustrates this for Albania, but the coast usually has more cooling days than the rest of the country<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>. During winter months, the number of heating days should decrease, along with related energy demand.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

                  <p>The energy network is thus exposed to increased demand precisely at the time of the year where its supply is expected to be the lowest. This should not be an issue in winter months, as river flows are expected to increase, but drier summer months, with higher evaporation and more frequent droughts will affect the level of the reservoirs in summer months.</p>

Disasters may affect means of production, such as offices, industrial production and processing plants, storage facilities and roads to transport products. Tourism, a major livelihood in the region, will also be affected, as discussed next. Agriculture would also be affected as a lot of marshlands below the sea level or at a low elevation have been turned into agricultural lands since the 1950s. <a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

                  <p>The increased frequency and intensity of heat waves and droughts is likely to increase the number of fires, especially forest fires, which threaten the natural environment, but also livelihoods, settlements, and lives. Data for the Vjosa basin demonstrates an increasing trend in the number of forest fires since 1990.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
                  <p>Health</p>
                  <p>Climate-related disasters will increase the risk of injury and preventable death among population, and especially among vulnerable groups.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Floods have been the natural hazard affecting most people between 1985-2019, and this trend has increased in recent years (<strong>Error!

                  <p>Projected temperature, precipitation and sea-level changes are also expected to affect health on various fronts:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>The decreased water availability, increased floods, and overall temperature increase will adversely affect the quantity and quality of drinking water and favour the spread of diseases.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

                <li>
                  <p>Increased temperatures will likely affect people’s lives and health, as adaptation of the human organism is not immediate. The increased number of heat days is expected to adversely affect Albania’s population. More tropical nights mean that people are less able to cool down at night and recover from the day’s heat.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Heat-related diseases and death (such as strokes, ischemic heart diseases, myocardial infarction, and chronic pulmonary diseases) are expected to increase proportionately with temperature rise. This will especially affect the older adults and the elderly, and other vulnerable groups of population,<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> whose numbers are expected to increase in the coming years.

                <li>
                  <p>Although the growing season is projected to become longer, the Albanian agricultural sector is vulnerable to climate change because of its dependence on water resources, the increased risks of drought and extreme temperatures, and floods and erosion due to SLR. This could affect food security.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All of the above will create an additional burden on the health system.</p>

              <h3>3.3.4. Risks and vulnerabilities of the tourism sector</h3>
              <p>The burgeoning tourism sector should be affected both favourably and unfavourably by projected climate change.</p>
              <p>Changes in touristic season</p>
              <p>The “sun and sea” tourism prevalent in the coastal area currently takes place essentially in the months of July and August, as these present the best temperature and precipitation conditions for this type of tourism. Changes in these variables will favour an extension of the touristic season, as described in <strong>Error! Reference source not found.</strong>.</p>

              <p>However, extreme temperatures and rainfall events will increasingly hinder the attractiveness of Albania’s coast during key summer months (June to September), regardless of the climate scenario.</p>
              <p>Touristic conditions</p>
              <p>The tourism sector will be affected by the same elements that affect Albanian coastal population and settlements.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Climate-related disasters will damage touristic infrastructure (e.g. hotels, villages, recreation parks, conference and fair centres, yacht harbours). They may also affect the much-needed increase in accommodation capacities and other touristic infrastructure that may be developed in order to support the projected growth of the sector.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>They will also damage supporting infrastructure such as airports, roads and ports, as well as the capacity to provide consistent energy and quality drinking water. It should be noted that, as of 2017, 81% of foreign visitors arrived to the country by land.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

                <li>
                  <p>Tourists will be exposed to some of the shorter-term health effects of the changed climatic conditions, such as heat strokes, skin burns, and vector-borne diseases.</p>
                  <p>Other factors may affect the attractiveness of Albania’s coast to tourists.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Loss of beach area due to SRL and erosion<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

              </ul>
              <p>The National Tourism Strategy 2019-2023 identifies climate change among the risks to the industry. The recent vulnerability assessment of the Vjosa region also projects that the growth of the sector will be limited by loss of beach area and limits to their carrying capacity.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
              <p>Anthropogenic pressure</p>
              <p>Tourists will bring additional anthropogenic pressure on water resources, on energy demand and on the natural environment. They may therefore contribute to further enhance the projected effects of climate change in the coastal area.</p>
              <p>Tables 8 and 9 summarize the analysis developed above. Table 8 summarizes the potential effects of changes in climate-related variables on settlements, populations and tourism sectors in the Albanian coast, while Table 9 summarizes the vulnerabilities and risk of these sectors with regards to the projected changes in climate-related variables.</p>

              <h3>3.3.5. Risks and vulnerabilities of the AFOLU sector</h3>
                  <h4>3.3.5.1. Current impacts of climate change</h4>
                  <p>Crops</p>
                  <p>Crop production in Albania is highly exposed and influenced by the effects of climate change that have occurred during the last decades. In recent decades, serious disturbances in climatic parameters have been observed and, this has been more evident in the precipitation regime in the country.</p>
                  <p>It is quite significant that during the period 2010-2020, the western lowlands of the country have been flooded many times, causing serious damage to agricultural production. However, based on the data obtained from various studies on climate change in the country, the annual precipitation has been decreasing, while the distribution of the precipitations during the year, has changed significantly, causing, heavy rainfall during the winter months, and long periods in summer without rainfall.</p>
                  <p>As a result of these changes, in the last decade, many floods have been observed. From these floods, about 10,000 ha of wheat, 15.000 ha of fodder crops, 1000 ha of fruit tree, and over 1500 ha of vineyards have been destroyed. The biggest damages were caused in the northwest (Shkodra and Lezha regions). Based on the estimates made by agricultural experts the resulting damages from floods to agricultural production were about 100 million USD. On the other side, it has been noticed that in the last decades, the summer season is becoming drier with rising average temperatures. The effects of these climate changes have led to an increase in the demand for irrigation water, as well as the demand for chemical treatments to protect plants from diseases and pests.</p>
                  <p>Livestock</p>
                  <p>As a result of floods, in addition to the loss of fodder crops some poultry have been also lost. The biggest damages were caused in the northwest (Shkoder and Lezha regions). Higher temperatures during summertime and lower precipitation strongly affect grazing systems because of their dependence on climatic conditions and limited adaptation opportunities<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a>. There could be far-reaching consequences for animal production through the effects on forage and range productivity. The small ruminant animals, sheep and goats in Albania are mainly kept in extensive pasture system and they are more vulnerable to climate change, including higher temperatures and shortage of forage.</p>
                  <p>The direct impacts of climate change are likely to be more limited in non-grazing systems mostly because the housing of animals in buildings allows for greater control of production conditions<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a>. The most productive animals, dairy cattle, laying hens, broilers and pigs are managed and housed in good conditions in Albania and the impact of climate change on them will be less than farm animals in the semi-intensive or extensive system. The surface planted with alfalfa, which makes the main forage used in ruminant animals feeding, is still stable with a slight increase. The high temperatures during the last few summer seasons may have affected the laying hens and dairy cattle production, but no data are available to quantify this impact.</p>
                  <p>The worst effect has been noticed in the area of diseases spread out in farm animals, because of high temperatures. Seven years ago, Albania had experienced the case of bluetongue diseases in cattle and then in sheep as climate change allowed its spread. Bluetongue disease is a non- contagious illness of ruminant animals that is transmitted through insects (Culicoides. Sp). In general, 900 head of cattle were infected, from which 175 died. Then the illness was spread out in small ruminant animals that infected 28,176 heads of sheep and 663 heads of goat from which were dead respectively 6379 and 142 Head of animals<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a>. These are the main financial losses without taking into account the losses from the low productivity of animals. Another disease that is affected by climate change is Krime-Kongo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) that is present in Albania and causes death in human being but affect animals. The warmer winter season helps the survival of larvae and rays spread out of CCHF. The same situation has happened with horses infected with the West Nile virus spread out by <i>Culex pipiens</i> mosquito that is adapted to high temperatures. In the year 2011, 22% of horses were infected.</p>
                  <p>Forests</p>
                  <p>Climate change directly affects the frequency and intensity of forest disturbances such as insect outbreaks, the increased presence of invasive species, fires, storms, etc. Also, rising temperatures, heat waves and reduced rainfall cause stress to trees, directly affecting the productivity of forests.</p>
                  <p>To date, there is no specific studies regarding the impact of climate change on Albanian forests. However, some impacts of those changes are already evident and consist of:</p>
                      <p>1. Damage to the coastal belt of Mediterranean pine forests (mainly <i>Pinus halepensis</i>). This damage occurred in two main areas:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>In Kune-Vain (Lezha municipality), where a forest belt of Mediterranean pines of about 80 ha has disappeared during 1985-2020 as a result of coastal erosion. The belt has a length of about 4 km and a maximum width of up to 400 meters. Coastal erosion in combination with a rising sea level has caused the loss of a significant amount of forest land in this area with an average extinction rate of about 2.3 ha/year.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>In Velipoje (Shkodra municipality), due to coastal erosion, a forest area of 34 ha with riparian forests was lost in the period 1985-2020. The rate of forest area of loss there has been about 1 ha/year.</p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>2. Changes have been observed in the vertical migration of forest areas. This has been observed to occur in the upper forest belt of Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) and Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce) where those forests are moving to the areas of alpine pastures. In some areas, a vertical shift of forest vegetation between 50-100 meters has been observed.</p>
                      <p>3. The high temperatures and heat waves that have invaded the country have led to substantial damage of forests by massive forest fires. The frequency of fires and the damage caused by them has increased in recent years. During the period 2011-2019, about 760 forest fires were identified, burning an area of 337,800 ha of the Albanian forests. The deforestation rate due to fires caused the 22% of forest area reduction over 12 years.</p>
                      <p>4. New pests and diseases are becoming more frequent and causing massive damages to forest fund. Especially the forests of black pine, chestnut, plane, oaks, and box-tree are suffering from the damages caused by diseases and pests. Thus, some of the diseases and pests have appeared that were not previously in our forests are Box tree moth, Chestnut gall wasp and plane trees canker stain. On the other hand, diseases and pests have increased the rate of their spread and intensity of infection of forest trees (The Pine processionary moth, Oak processionary moth, Box tree moth, Chestnut gall wasp, Chestnut blight etc.). In total, it is estimated that the rate of forest impact by pests and diseases is spread over an area of about 200,000 ha or 20% of the total forest area of Albania.</p>
                  <p>Pastures and Meadows</p>
                  <p>After 1990, pastures in Albania are not actively maintained due to lacking human and financial resources, resulting in changes in the vegetation and pasture degradation. Pastures at altitudes 1500-1800 m are turning to shrublands domination by Juniperus. Pastures at higher elevations, above 1800 m do not show significant change.</p>
                  <p>The analyses of digital photographs show a decrease of cover vegetation at 5 % of the alpine grasslands in Nemërçka Mt from 2004 to 2010<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>. On the other hand, overgrazing of the alpine pastures led to increased presence of thorny and pioneer species like Centaurea sp. Cirsium sps. or so-called “resistant” species like Sesleria tenerrima etc. The same study refers that higher presence of invasive and pioneer species that has changed the structure of alpine grasslands mostly observed in Wide and Nemërçka Mts.</p>
                  <p>Climate change effects on pastures were evident since the late 1990s, more precisely since the snowless winter of 1997. Since 1997, winters in Albania have become shorter and milder, whereas summers have become longer and hotter. Droughts in summer and sometimes even in autumn, and then sudden floods, have become more frequent. The climate change effects have increased the number and the intensity of fires in Albania negatively affecting grassland and pasture ecosystems.</p>
                  <p>Lagoons and Wetlands</p>
                  <p>Coastal lagoons are formed and maintained through sediment transport processes, which are affected by climaticchanges. Sediments carried by rivers, waves, currents, wind, and tides accumulate in the river and tidal deltas, on marshes and flats where submerged aquatic vegetation slows currents, and on wash over fans. The process of sedimentation which can eventually fill in lagoons is interrupted in rivers such as Drini heavily affecting the sediments on the Adriatic coast<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>. Therefore, lagoon barriers in Shengjin and Patok area are constantly eroded by climate change related waves and wind, requiring continuous sediment deposition to maintain them.</p>
                  <p>Water quantity and quality in the lagoons is influenced by the rate at which the lagoon loses or gains water from evaporation, precipitation, groundwater input, surface runoff, and exchange with the sea<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>. Lagoon–sea exchange is driven by tides and wave action and is often the largest component of lagoon water balance<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a>. Some of the lagoons such as Kune – Vain, Orikum have almost lost communication with the sea as the most of communication channels are closed. Rising temperatures lead to increased eutrophication and change in water quality and salinity.</p>
                  <p>There is observed and monitored change in the phytoplankton and zooplankton composition, as well as an increase of alien species population such as the blue crab <i>Callinectes sapidus</i>, competing will the local crab populations.</p>
                  <p>Strong human pressures and inappropriate management practices have significantly reduced the natural system’s adaptability and resilience. Climate change is an added stress for wetlands and will highly influence the nature and function of specific wetlands, in particular the hydrological regime and the biodiversity. Climate change in combination with human-induced pressures is likely to become increasingly important factor leading to wetlands degradation and loss.</p>
                  <p>Aquaculture and Fisheries</p>
                  <p>Albanian coast is part of the Mediterranean basin, which is warming 20% faster than the rest of the globe as a whole<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a>. Anticipated changes (increased sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity, greater frequency of heat waves, sea-level rise, decrease in precipitation and changes in oceanographic circulation<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a>, are expected to have a strong impact on habitats and ecosystems in general, and on fisheries and fisheries resources in particular. For instance, in the Adriatic Sea, the sardine, mackerel and anchovy respond to salinity changes, which are modulated by the climate oscillations, as described by the pressure differences between the mid-north Atlantic and the southeast Mediterranean. This behaviour change can be attributed to ongoing climatic changes, which change the migration patterns of pelagic fish in the Adriatic. Due to meridionalization and tropicalization several non-native species started to appear along the coasts of Albania during the last 2 decades. Those include blue fish, blue crab and silver- cheeked toadfish.</p>
                  <h4>3.3.5.2. Future impacts of climate change</h4>
                  <p>Crops</p>
                  <p>The future climatic changes in Albania are expected to have major effects on the crop production. Specifically in lowland areas it is predicted that the yield of maize will decrease by 17%, and the yield of tomatoes and watermelon will decline by 6-11%. In the agricultural areas with limited irrigation opportunities or no irrigation at all, it is expected that the yield of alfalfa will decrease by 6%, the yield of grapes -- by 17-23%, the yield of olives -- by 11 - 20%, while the yield of wheat is expected to increase by 4 - 5%.</p>
                  <p>Albania’s statistical data on the yield and agricultural production in recent decades suggests that the level of inputs (chemical fertilizers, quality seeds, pesticides) as well as the level of modernization (irrigation, harvesting technologies, etc.) have been growing at very low rates, compared to the European Union countries. In these conditions, taking into account the expected effects of climate change on agriculture the Albania's gross domestic product, will potentially lose 800-900 million USD of income from crop production by 2050 (expert assumption).</p>                  <p>Table 12.

                  <p>According to the World Bank study, the main projected climate changes that could impact the livestock sector are: (1) temperature increase and (2) precipitation becoming more variable. (3) damaging effects of severe floods. For some feedstock crops, the future climate impacts will be positive and for some other negative. The temperature stress effect on livestock will be gradual over time. The extensive and intensive livestock production systems will be affected differently by climate change and, thus, different adaptation strategies must be implemented. The impacts of climate change on livestock production are represented by:</p>

                  </ul>
                      <p>Temperature affects most of the critical factors for livestock production, such as water availability, animal production, reproduction and health. Forage quantity and quality are affected by a combination of increases in temperature, CO2 and precipitation variation. Livestock diseases are mainly affected by an increase in temperature and precipitation. Livestock in higher latitudes will be more affected by the increase of temperatures than livestock located in lower latitudes because livestock in lower latitudes is usually better adapted to high temperatures and droughts. Heat stress negatively affects milk and meat production as well as its quality, resulting in the alteration of cheese making properties and the merchandise value of milk. These changes result in significant, negative economic impacts for producers and consumers. High-producing dairy cows are more sensitive to heat stress. Negative effects can be noticed on beef breeds resulting in lower daily gains. In Albania, there are no pure beef breeds of ruminant animals, (cattle or sheep and goats). Meat production is based on young female animals not designated as overhaul animals and males or offspring of crosses between milk breeds with the semen of meat breeds. High temperatures have a negative impact on monogastric animals, pigs and poultry. According to literature (different authors) reduced and inconsistent growth, decreased feed efficiency, decreased carcass quality, poor sow performance, decreased reproductive performance (male and female), increased mortality, (especially in sows and market hogs), and morbidity is the main economic losses associated with heat stress in the swine industry. The poultry industry may also be compromised by low production at temperatures higher than 30oC. The climate impacts may vary by agro-ecological zone (Table 12).</p>

                      <p>In addition to problems caused by lack of capacities and support for the forestry sector, lack of law enforcement and forest fires, forests are expected to be significantly affected by future climatic changes. Forests on sites with the coldest conditions could experience, on average, an increase in productivity, while forests on the warmest sites may show a productivity decline. Additionally, pest and diseases will be more present, affecting more forest area and species in Albania.</p>
                      <p>Considering the situation of the Albanian forests and management capacities, the vulnerability assessment shows that some forest types are most at risk from climate change. Those forest types are: sweet chestnut forests, Mediterranean and Anatolian fir forest, Alpine Scots pine and Black pine forest, Coastal forests with Mediterranean pines, Riparian forests, Mediterranean and Anatolian Black pine forest. Other forest types that will be affected are: Boxtree forests, Illyrian mountainous beech forest, Plantations of site-native species with black pine, Mediterranean evergreen Oak forest, Mountainous Moesian beech forest and some other forest types (birch, floodplain forests, European spruce etc.).</p>
                      <p>Based on existing literature (Albanian National Communications to UNFCCC), some of the expected effects of climate changes on forests are:</p>

                          <p>In general, evergreen species and oak forests are expected to enlarge, while the area of beech forests, which are more important to produce wood, would reduce.</p>

                          <p>The species that resist high temperatures and severe long dry seasons would be able to survive. For those that need moisture (silver fir, etc.), the danger of being limited in distribution or disappearing does exist.</p>

                          <p>With the average annual temperature across the country increased between 0.8 – 1.0°C by 2025 and 2.9 – 5.3°C by 2100, shifts in the timing and frequency of climate extremes, such as drought and heatwaves, can generate sustained shifts in pasture and meadows function with important ecological and economic impacts, including a reduction of productivity. As the average annual precipitation across the country is expected to decline 2.6-3.4% by 2025 and 5.9-6.3% by 2050 this will result direct yield response. As described by PACE experiment<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> on the Pastures and Climate Extremes using a factorial combination of elevated temperature (ambient +3°C) and winter/spring extreme drought (60% rainfall reduction) resulted in productivity declines of up to 73%. Functional group identity was not an important predictor of yield response to drought. Cool season drought translates into significant reductions in annual biomass production for four species/mixtures, ranging from 33% to 70%. Many species recover rapidly once the drought ends, although there were carry-over effects on warm season (summer/autumn) growth on specific species/mixtures, spanning all functional groups.</p>

                          <p>Among other potential impacts, sea-level rise is projected to reduce the amount of available freshwater, as seawater pushes further into underground water tables. This is also likely to lead to much more saltwater intrusion into bodies of freshwater, affecting the water quality in lagoons and wetlands. It will also affect biodiversity in coastal habitats, and the natural services and goods they provide. Many wetland areas will be lost, threatening unique bird and plant species, and removing the natural protection these areas provide against storm surges.</p>
                          <p>According to Lefebre (2019) simulation of the future evolution of water balance, wetland condition and water volumes in 229 localities around the Mediterranean basin<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a>, the future projections of the relevant climatic variables under two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios are considered, assuming a stabilization (RCP4.5) or increase (RCP 8.5) of greenhouse gases emissions. Similar increases of water deficits at most localities around 2050 under both RCP scenarios are found. By 2100, however, water deficits under RCP 8.5 are expected to be more severe and will impact all localities. Simulations performed under current conditions show that 97% of localities could have wetland habitats in a good state. By 2050, however, this proportion would decrease to 81% and 68% under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, decreasing further to 52% and 27% by 2100.</p>
                          <p>The studies for the Mediterranean basin including Albanian coastal lagoons suggest that wetlands can persist with up to a 400 mm decrease in annual precipitation. Such resilience to climate change is attributed to the semi-permanent character of wetlands (lower evaporation on dry ground) and their capacity to act as a reservoir (when higher precipitation will occur during winter).</p>
                          <p>Although Albania, is not listed among the countries of higher risk of wetland degradation and loss, some specific areas such as Kune Vain, Patok and Orikum are more vulnerable due to very dynamic coastal shore. Degradation of wetlands with emergent vegetation will negatively affect their biodiversity and the services they provide by eliminating animal refuges and primary production.</p>

                          <p>The vulnerabilities for pelagic and demersal fisheries in the Adriatic sub-region seem nearly identical regarding wider society/economy implications, fisheries resources and community and livelihood relatives impacts, respectively61. In the case of fishing operations impacts comparisons, in the Adriatic sub-region, the demersal fisheries will be more severely impacted in comparison to the pelagic fisheries.</p>
                          <p>The comparison study has been conducted between the SST anomalies for RCPs near (2016- 2050) and distant (2066-2100) projections and the relative vulnerability index of Albanian marine fisheries62. In the most severe scenarios, the difference between the two projections (near and distant) SST anomalies become less evident, which means that it should be implemented an urgent and strategic plan of measures to tackle the effects coming from the SST anomalies. In the near projections, the vulnerability is decreasing in comparison between the less and more severe scenarios, while in the distant projections, there is no difference between the vulnerability index of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Probably this is because in the distant projections the effects of climate change on marine fisheries will be devastating, which would have required drastic measures to save the remaining marine fisheries sectors (as result these would be less vulnerable). Another important used tool63 by Bakiu, represented by DDS of the Aquaculture in Greece (developed in the frame of ClimeFish project implementation), showed that regarding the production/biological simulations in the two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), there is a higher growth rate in the first scenario, while the feed consumption (kg/weeks) is considerably higher than the second scenario – it probably creates a higher cost to support the growth of the European seabass by the farmers in the Vlora Bay. Furthermore, the total biomass for the same time seems to be lower in the second scenario – this is supported by the fact that the European seabass is considered to be highly vulnerable to SST increase in the Adriatic Sea. Other relative predictions showed an increase of heatwave days in each considered years for both scenarios, which could be considered as an alert signal regarding mussels farming and freshwater species in the Albanian territory. The temperature and the heatwave day’s number increase represent the climate change factors, which together with the factors indirectly linked to climate change can further enhance the impact of CC effects to the aquaculture sectors (marine and freshwater aquaculture).</p>

                        <p>Currently available analysis on how climate change affects men and women differently in Albania is limited and focuses on the agriculture sector. This is relevant given that agriculture is a labour- intensive sector highly dependent on environmental conditions. The different vulnerabilities in this sector depend to a large extent on the differentiated roles of women and men in the agricultural value chain.</p>
                        <p>According to a survey conducted for the Fourth National Communication (4NC), 39% of respondents believe there are differences in men’s and women’s ability to react to climate change, and among them, 53% believe men are more able to address climate change challenges.<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Increase of the workload by four hours on average, to clean up and due to lack of energy supply</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Increase in violence against women, both domestic and outside the home, with women heads of households facing a greater risk</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Decreased income</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Loss of access to services that helped alleviate women’s workload (e.g., kindergarten, schools, etc.)<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                    <p>The increase in violence against women and that of time use for main household chores were also identified as the main impacts of climate change on women’s living conditions in the FNC survey. The survey does not identify significant gender differences regarding the effects of increased conflicts in settlements or in reactions of hopelessness and sense of loss.<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> They survey also identified significant differences in access to information about adaptation to climate change.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
                    <p>Health</p>
                    <p>According to the 4NC survey, women reported a more significant increase in health, physical and emotional problems than men following climate-related disasters. This is reported to intersect with ethnicity and location (especially in areas with more vulnerable populations), poverty or migration status.</p>
                    <p>Exposure to high temperatures has adverse effects on pregnant women (teratogenic effect). Following floods, they can develop bronchitis or infections as they cleanup damp houses. Pregnant women are disproportionately more affected by healthcare access disruption following a disaster.</p>
                    <p>Energy</p>
                    <p>No studies are available on the effects of climate change on gender in the energy sector in Albania. According to UN Women, it is very likely that energy supply, use and consumption affect men and women differently, and intersects with factors such as location, age and financial status. Energy is considered to be a male topic, but household management is a women responsibility.<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
                    <p>Energy poverty may thus be worsened by climate change, as it affects energy consumption, means of heating, health and overall quality of life, including during winter, all topics typically falling under women’s purview.</p>

                        <p>The country has taken initial steps to mainstream gender in its climate change policies and programs. This included guidelines on mainstreaming gender in climate change mitigation and adaptation programs and plans in the 4NC. However, this has not been reflected in any of the recent climate-related policies and laws, none of which systematically address gender issues. This includes:</p>
                  <ul>

                </ul>
                    <p>Neither do gender-related strategies, such as the Third National Strategy on Gender Equality (NSGE) and its Action Plan 2016-2020, consider climate change issues. In contrast, climate change is identified in five Municipal Council’s Gender Equity Local Action Plans 2018-2020.<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
                    <p>Progress is hindered by the limited availability of data. Only a few studies on the effects of climate change on gender in Albania are available, and most focus on the agriculture sector. Disaster Risk Management and Environment, Energy Poverty and Climate Change were identified by UN Women as largely undocumented gender issues.<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The Albanian Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) has increased the use of gender indicators and added gender equality sections to some of its reports. Only a few ministries collect gender disaggregated data on issues related to climate change. This includes the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and its Agriculture and Rural Development Agency (ARDA) but not the Civil Protection Units. Uptake is greater at local level, where municipalities are establishing gender indicators in their budget monitoring systems.</p>
                    <p>The limited presence of women in key decision-making spheres is also a barrier to progress on this issue.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the 4NC identifies four driving forces for change:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>The various conventions ratified</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>The existence of national binding rules for updating the majority of strategies related to gender equality</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The pressure of the Albanian Government to align to requirements brought by the European Integration process</p>

                </ul>
                    <p>Section 4.4 includes the four objectives identified in the Gender Action Plan included in the 4NC.</p>
          <h2><a>3.4 Adaptation measures</a></h2>
              <h3>3.4.1. Overview of adaptation measures</h3>
              <p>Albania has developed and implemented a large number of adaptation related policies, strategies, plans, programmes, project and actions. Among others, the country has identified priority adaptation actions in the National Strategy on Development and Integration 2015-2020, the Third National Communication, the National Climate Change Policy and the NSCC and its National Adaptation Plan, the Adaptation Plan for Tirana, the national tourism strategy 2019- 2023, the national forest policy 2019-2030, the integrated cross-sectoral plan of Tirana-Durres area and the Green Climate Fund Country Programme that was developed in a participatory manner based on the previous documents. These documents identify a very large number of adaptation actions. These are categorized and summarized in tables below<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a>. In tune with the Paris Agreement’s adaptation objectives, these actions will enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, with a view to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature goal referred to in Article 2 of the Paris agreement.</p>
              <h3>3.4.2. Prioritization of adaptation measures</h3>
              <p>Considering that all the actions identified have significant potential to contribute to adaptation in Albania's coastal area, the prioritization exercise focused on two main aspects, namely:</p>
              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Co-benefit potential of the actions, which refers to the probability and the extent to which said actions can also generate (i) socio-economic development and (ii) mitigation benefits.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Ease of implementation, which seeks to identify actions whose implementation is easier to achieve. This aspect considers the complexity of (i) the institutional and (ii) technical requirements and (iii) the magnitude of costs (financial aspects) as inversely proportional to the ease of implementation, i.e., a very expensive measure is less “easy to implement” considering that a large budget needs to be mobilized. Feasibility was not analysed as all of the actions are considered both feasible and necessary.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>Each sub-category was rated as “low”, “medium” or “high”, and ratings were weighted and cumulated, leading to an overall priority rating.<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Detailed ratings are available in Annex 2. Adaptation</p>
              <p>Several measures related to policy and governance are rated as very high, largely due to their potential important development co-benefits and limited technical complexity and costs. These include developing sectoral adaptation plans and disaster risk management plans as well as mainstreaming adaptation into spatial/territorial and sectoral planning and legislation. Measures pertaining to enhancing technical capacity and awareness raising also have a very high priority as they have important co-benefits and are simple to implement.</p>
              <p>All measures pertaining to adapting the supporting natural environment are considered as having very high priority, given the extent of both mitigation and development co-benefits they could generate, and their limited institutional complexity and relatively low costs. Water and energy efficiency, and rainwater harvesting are the measures to prioritize in terms of adaptation of the supporting built environment. All measures related to promoting gender equality in relation to adaptation should also be considered as having very high priority. Gender-related measures are meant to be structuring in the sense that they are meant to ensure gender is mainstreamed across all the other measures, including for example sectoral adaptation plans.</p>
              <p>Several measures that are very important for adaptation, such as those related to generating scientific evidence in support of decision-making, to climate-proofing infrastructure, or to disaster risk management are not highlighted as having a “very high priority” mainly due to their high technical complexity and costs.</p>
              <p>It is important to highlight that while this prioritization exercise highlights the “low hanging fruits” in terms of adaptation, that can be enacted rapidly and can generate multiple benefits, Albania acknowledges the importance of planning, budgeting for and implementing more complex, costly and specific adaptation measures as well.</p>

      <h1><a>4. FAIRNESS, AMBITION AND CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CONVENTION</a></h1>
      <p>The revised NDC of Albania presents an ambition that contributes to achieving the objectives of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, and to achieve regional and national strategies and plans.</p>
      <p>At the <strong>national level</strong>, the NDC is aligned with Albania’s long term national and sectoral development strategies, plans and goals. On mitigation, sectoral projections used for the NDC scenario are based on national strategies, including the National Strategy on Development Integration 2015-2020, the National Strategy on Climate Change, the National Action Plan on Mitigation, the National Energy Strategy, and other sectoral plans. On adaptation, the planned adaptation measures for settlements, populations and tourism are aligned with the National Strategy for Development and Integration 2015-2020, especially the pillar 4th on Growth through the sustainable use of resources and territorial development. They are also in tune with the objectives of the National Adaptation Plan, as well as the ones of the Integrated Cross-Sectoral Plan for the Coast and the National Strategy for Sustainable Tourism Development 2019-2023, among others.</p>
      <p>The revised NDC is also in harmony with Albania’s post-earthquake/disaster and COVID-19 green recovery strategies and plans. The proposed adaptation measures, and especially the ones on the built environment and on disaster risk management, are aligned with and contribute to the guiding principles of the Albania post-disaster needs assessments, which specifically aims to achieve reconstruction and recovery in a manner that increases the resilience of infrastructures, ecosystems, the environment, and vulnerable communities to future disasters, including anthropogenic and climate shocks, and to promote adaptation to climate change by introducing specific measures into sectoral recovery and reconstruction programs. The revised NDC is also aligned and contributes to the UN Albania COVID-19 Socio-Economic Recovery and Response Plan, which complements the Government of Albania’s National Response Plan and the National Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The revised NDC supports the need to invest in a low-carbon and resilient economy, by promoting clean, green, sustainable and resilient investments, ensuring post COVID-19 green recovery.</p>
      <p>The revised NDC is closely aligned with the Fourth National Communication being developed in parallel, as well as the Third National Communication of Albania to the UNFCCC.</p>
      <p>At the <strong>regional level</strong>, the NDC is also aligned with EU’s Green Deal, which aims to enhance the EU climate 2030 objective, taking into account all sectors (including FOLU), to decarbonise the energy sector, supporting innovation in transport and industry; through an action plan in order to boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy. According to the EU Green Deal, a Just Transition Mechanism and Fund has been set up to help regions and sectors the most affected by the cost of transition, due to their reliance on fossil fuels such as coal.</p>
      <p>The Green Agenda for the Western Balkans, included in the Communication on an Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans adopted by the European Commission in 2020, has five pillars: (1) climate action, including decarbonisation, energy and mobility, (2) circular economy, addressing in particular waste, recycling, sustainable production and efficient use of resources, (3) biodiversity, aiming to protect and restore the natural wealth of the region, (4) fighting pollution of air, water and soil and (5) sustainable food systems and rural areas. The implementation of this Green Agenda requires substantial public and private funding, at national, regional and international level, and the EU considers supporting innovative financial instruments such as the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA). This revised NDC is aligned and directly contributes to the first pilar on climate action (both on mitigation and adaptation), as well as the 3rd one biodiversity (adaptation measures on adapting the supporting natural environment).</p>
      <p>At the <strong>global level</strong>, as presented in point 6 of section 3, implementation of this revised NDC contributes to achievement of the Paris Agreement, reflecting Albania’s own national circumstances. In this sense, Albania’s contribution is both fair and ambitious. Albania’s historical and current levels of GHG emissions are low, at the global level and in comparison to other European countries. Albania’s national GHG emissions represented only 0.02% of global emissions in 2016. While the average level of emissions per inhabitant was 8.7 t CO2e/hab in the EU-27 in 2018, the level of emission per capita in Albania was 3.5 t CO2e/hab in 2016. Albania is a country with an economy in transition and expects human and economic developments in the next decades, which would increase the level of emissions, which, as noted, are historically low. The NDC considers a lower level of emissions increase in comparison to the expected business- as-usual scenario (-16.3% in 2030), considering more sectors and gases than in its first NDC. This constitutes a high ambition given the capacities of the country. The emissions reduction objective is not defined as a general target but is based on a bottom-up approach taking into account possible mitigation actions sector by sector, ensuring that the final target remains a realistic and reachable figure, considering the current of implementation of existing mitigation actions, which is sometimes limited. Albania will take into account the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC in its future development and commits to decouple GHG emissions from its economic growth and embark on a low emission development pathway beyond 2030.This NDC also includes adaptation measures, which is an enhancement of the first NDC, and will absorb significant resources.</p>
      <p>In addition, the implementation of this NDC will directly contribute to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate action, and indirectly to SDG7: Affordable and Clean Energy (mitigation target), SDG3: Good health and well-being (adaptation health measures), and SDG 5: Gender equality (cross-cutting focus on the revised NDC, which is addressing gender differentiated vulnerabilities to climate change and gender gaps and structural barriers).</p>
      <p>The implementation of the mitigation and adaptation measures included in this revised NDC will contribute to human rights in a broader sense, in line with Albania’s national policies and regional and global commitments, including the 2030 Agenda and the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters, through participatory processes, including a strong engagement of youth.</p>
      <p>By promoting the climate proofing of residential and productive infrastructure, touristic accommodation and assets and health (and other social) facilities, and the strengthening of disaster risk management, the revised NDC is aligned and directly contributes to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 which outlines four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks: (i) Understanding disaster risk; (ii) Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; (iii) Investing in disaster reduction for resilience and; (iv) Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to "Build Back Better" in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>
      <h1><a>5. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</a></h1>
          <h2><a>5.1. Institutional and legal aspects</a></h2>
          <p>Strengths: The Inter-Ministerial Working Group on Climate Change (IMWGCC), which coordinates all institutions involved in climate change processes, will facilitate the implementation of this NDC, and will promote some of the proposed adaptation measures, especially on strengthening the enabling environment. Furthermore, Albania’s institutional arrangements already enable the preparation of national inventory and projections and comply with international reporting requirements. The existing coordination between the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, other ministries, UNDP, FAO-Albania, and other institutional actors, is a strength to improve the MRV framework in the country as well as the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions. General and sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies are well documented in specific legal and policy documents, such as the National Energy and Climate Plan. The National Climate Change Strategy included national mitigation and adaptation plans (NAP). The Government of Albania is currently developing an action plan for this NDC to provide direction and a timeline for implementing adaptation and mitigation actions.</p>
          <p>Gaps: Precise objectives or means of implementation are sometimes lacking, and some of the policy and legal documents have not been fully approved. There is a lack of consistency among different areas of policy, which relies on a high number of external consultancy projects. There is a need to move from a project-based approach to a more mainstreamed process. There is a lack of public awareness to acknowledge relevance of climate change. Adopted policies and measures are not always applied.</p>
          <p>The adaptation section of this NDC incorporates adaptation actions for the Albanian Coast encompassing all current policies and strategies targeting settlements, population and tourism. This structure provides an opportunity to adopt a systematic approach to implementing adaptation actions. The NAP focuses on mainstreaming adaptation into sectoral approaches. Doing this will contribute to strengthen the enabling environment when implemented.</p>
          <h2><a>5.2. Knowledge and capacity</a></h2>
          <p>Strengths: Some knowledge and capacities are available within the administration, universities and other Albanian institutions both on mitigation and adaptation. For example, technical capacities are available to develop the MRV for mitigation in all sectors.</p>
          <p>Gaps: However, scientific, technical and societal capacities could be further developed, to generate scientific evidence to support decision making on the most strategic measures and their implementation. For instance, on mitigation, the country is lacking harmonized, complete and consistent datasets for various sectors, such as for Waste and FOLU. Existing datasets could be improved for a more precise monitoring. Furthermore, there is no mitigation action tracking system that would enable the monitoring of implementation of policies and measures and of their impact in terms of GHG emissions reduction. In terms of adaptation, technical capacity to plan for adaptation, both on policy and on technical aspects, needs to be further strengthened at all levels.</p>
          <h2><a>5.3. Technology transfer</a></h2>
          <p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Albania already benefits from the creation of the <i>Units of Information, Technology and Communication</i> and the <i>Agency of Research, Technology and Innovation</i> (AKTI). In some sectors, there is no need for important technology transfer (Agriculture, FOLU). In the Waste sector, a technology transfer is already undergoing with the building of new incinerators.</p>
          <p>Gaps: Albania would benefit from updating its Technology needs Assessment (TNA), assessing the technology needs for both mitigation and adaptation in the different economic sectors. Its latest version was published in 2005 and is a bit outdated. For the energy sector, there is a need to enhance technology transfer, for example for the oil and gas sector and on renewable energy. According to the EU Low Carbon Economy Roadmap, significant investments and technological transfers will be needed, in particular in new low-carbon technologies, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and grid infrastructure. Adapting the supporting built environment and climate proofing residential and productive infrastructure, touristic accommodation and assets and health (and other social) facilities will also require accessing new technologies.</p>
          <h2><a>5.4. Finance</a></h2>
          <p>Strengths: Albania has a robust financial strategy on mitigation and adaptation, including financial needs and potential sources of funding. Adaptation measures were prioritized in this revised NDC according to the relative magnitude of their costs, among others. Several measures that are very important for adaptation also have a low cost including several measures related to generating scientific evidence in support of decision-making and to capacity-building. These could be more easily incorporated in budgets and short-term plans. In the agriculture sector, most mitigation actions have a low cost and even can deliver additional revenues.</p>
          <p><strong>Gaps</strong>: Albania does not currently integrate climate change considerations and criteria, as well as relevant policies, in the guidance, procedures and methodologies used for selection and appraisal of public investment programs and projects. Such criteria need to include: (i) impacts of the project on climate change mitigation efforts, to determine if the project will lead to an increase or decrease of GHG emissions. Projects that have significant impact on GHG emissions should conduct GHG accounting and use the shadow price of carbon in their economic analysis and (ii) assessment of climate change risks and vulnerabilities relevant for the project, as well as if the project outcomes contribute to adaptation efforts and strengthening climate resilience. Public and private investments shall be secured and tracked so that they ensure effective implementation of the NDC in all sectors. In addition, Albania has limited experience in carbon pricing instruments to promote decarbonisation, including the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. With regards to adaptation, some essential measures involving among other climate-proofing infrastructure, or disaster risk management are not highlighted as having a “very high priority” mainly due to their high technical complexity and costs.</p>

            <p>The Republic of Albania is a Balkan country in Southeast Europe, mostly mountainous. Albania has a subtropical Mediterranean climate, with some continental influence. In 2019, Albania had an estimated population of 2.88 million. Recent demographic developments show that Albania's population is shrinking and heading towards aging. Albania is fairly densely populated. In 2018, the average population density was 99.7 inhabitants per km2. Albania has experienced a strong urbanization process. After 50 years of communist rule, Albania has transformed from one of the poorest countries in Europe in the early 1990s to an upper-middle- income country in 2020. Economic growth has been associated with structural economic changes. In 2019, the service sector constituted about 50% of the GDP of the country. Industry and construction made up about 20% of the GDP and the agriculture sector contributed about 19% of the GDP. The socio-economic progress of Albania has been recently hampered by two shocks: the country was hit by a devastating earthquake in November 2019; and the COVID- 19 crisis. The earthquake and the pandemic are expected to significantly increase poverty.</p>

          <p>The NDC scenario is based on the National Energy Strategy and also takes into account the Gas Master Plan of Albania, considering the introduction of natural gas in almost all sectors (including energy industry, manufacturing industry, transport, commercial, residential and agriculture). This scenario considers the implementation of the different National Energy Efficiencies Actions Plans (NEEAP) to increase energy efficiencies in both supply and demand reaching a 15% gain in 2030. The 15% in final demand is split among sectors as presented in the table below.</p>

          <p>It also takes into account the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) with objectives of a share of 38% of renewables in the final energy consumption in 2020 and 42% in 2030.</p>
              <h3>7.1.1. Electricity Production</h3>
              <p>The BAU scenario is based on the following production mix evolution. It is expected that natural gas will enter the market in 2023 and then increase in 2026 with the entry into force of new CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine) installations.</p>
              <p>Table 28. Production mix evolution – BAU scenario</p>
              <p><img width="587" height="209" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-31.png"></p>
              <p>In the NDC scenario, new CCGT (300 MW) are replaced by additional renewable energy sources (+50 MW of solar PV and +50 MW of wind):</p>

              <p><img width="602" height="230" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-32.png"></p>
              <p>The impact in terms of Natural gas consumptions according to both scenarios is presented on the figures below.</p>
              <p>Figure 27. Fuel consumption – electricity and heat plants (BAU)</p>
              <p><img width="502" height="224" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-33.png"></p>
              <p>Natural gas consumption is reduced by 79% between the BAU and the NDC scenarios because of the reduction of electricity production from thermal power generation due to the increase in renewable electricity production and the reduction of distribution losses and final consumption thanks to energy efficiency actions.</p>

              <h3>7.1.2. Refining</h3>
              <p>It is expected that the crude oil amount refined will increase from 300 kt in 2016 to 900 kt in 2030 according to national full capacities. Emissions increase proportionally. BAU and NDC have similar trends.</p>
              <p>Figure 29. Fuel consumption – petroleum refining (BAU; NDC)</p>
                    <p><img width="406" height="224" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-35.png"></p>
              <h3>7.1.3. Manufacturing industry</h3>
              <p>In the BAU, activity trend evolves proportionally to the GDP forecast. The energy mix remains the same on the entire time series, mainly relying on petroleum products.</p>
              <p><img width="448" height="224" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-36.png"></p>
              <p>The NDC scenario takes into account the EE target in 2030. Total energy consumption (excluding electricity) is reduced by 18% in 2030 between the BAU and the NDC scenarios. Liquid fuels are reduced by 75% between the two scenarios as natural gas consumption is increasing.</p>
              <p>Figure 31. Fuel consumption – manufacturing industry (NDC)</p>
              <p><img width="527" height="224" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-37.png"></p>
              <h3>7.1.4. Aviation</h3>
              <p>Modelisation is based on LEAP assumptions: differences between the two scenarios are marginal.</p>
              <p>According to the report “Feasibility Study for an airport in the South of Albania” Republic of Albania - Civil Aviation Authority (2019), a correlation factor of 2 can be applied to the GDP growth.</p>
              <p><img width="224" height="84" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-38.png"></p>
              <p>This leads to a doubling of national consumption between 2016 and 2030 which is consistent with the coming opening of airports in the country.</p>
              <p>Figure 32. Fuel consumption – domestic and international aviation (BAU; NDC)</p>

              <h3>7.1.5. Road transport</h3>
              <p>Modelisation is based on LEAP assumptions distinguishing passenger and freight transport. The biofuel share is between 3 to 4% of the blend in the recent years and increases up to 10% in 2030 as officially endorsed.</p>
              <p>Figure 33. Fuel consumption – road transport (BAU)</p>
              <p><img width="446" height="232" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-40.png"></p>
              <p>NDC modelisation based on LEAP assumptions takes int account EE improvement. Natural gas is expected to enter the market from 2026 onwards. These assumptions were complemented by increasing penetration of electrical vehicles and bicycle ride lengths reducing overall passenger vehicles fuel consumptions by 14.5%. Total fuel consumption (excluding electricity) decreases by 16.6% between the BAU and NDC scenarios in 2030.</p>

              <h3>7.1.6. Activity data – Commercial</h3>
              <p>Modelisation is based on LEAP assumptions. The consumption is expected to increase by 136% between 2016 and 2030 due to the increase of heated surfaces (m²). This increase is driven by LPG (Liquefied petroleum gas) consumption as the wood consumption increase is expected to be limited to 15% maximum on the same period.</p>
              <p>Figure 35. Fuel consumption – commercial (BAU)</p>
              <p><img width="455" height="259" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-42.png"></p>
              <p>In the NDC scenario, the consumption is expected to decrease by 17.3% in 2030 compared to the BAU scenario. Natural gas will enter the market from 2023 onwards to reach almost 70% of the total fuel consumption (excluding electricity) in 2030.</p>

              <h3>7.1.7. Activity data – Residential</h3>
              <p>Modelisation is based on LEAP assumptions considering hot water, cooking, lighting, appliances, & air conditioning cooling. Energy consumption growth is based on the number of household growth (considering population and household size). The consumption is expected to increase by 54% between 2016 and 2030 due to the increase of heated surfaces (m²). This increase is driven by LPG consumption as the wood consumption increase is expected to be limited to 15% maximum on the same period (the share of wood drops from 64%in 2016 to 48% in 2030).</p>

              <p><img width="409" height="218" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-44.png"></p>
              <p>The total fuel consumption (excluding electricity) in 2030 is expected to be reduced by 19.3% between the BAU and NDC scenarios. The mix will evolve as biomass and liquid fuels consumptions will be reduced and compensated by natural gas from 2023 onwards which will reach 30% of total fuel consumption in 2030.</p>

              <h3>7.1.8. Activity data – Agriculture</h3>
              <p>Modelisation is based on LEAP. Energy consumption growth is based on GDP forecast, final energy intensity and energy mix variations. The consumption is expected to increase by 78% between 2016 and 2030, liquid fuels increasing from 64% to 88% in the mix.</p>

          <h2><a>7.2. IPPU</a></h2>
          <p>The BAU scenario is based on the GDP trend for all sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry. For F-gases, emissions are based on a model considering imports, bank, equipment market, refrigerant market share, equipment production, average characteristics of equipment, etc. The impact of the Kigali amendment ratification is considered in the BAU.</p>
          <p>In the NDC scenario, no improvements are expected concerning emissions from industrial processes - the scenario is the same as the BAU (this does not include energy consumption which is covered under the energy sector).</p>
          <h2><a>7.3. Waste</a></h2>
          <p>For the <strong>landfilling</strong> subsector, in the BAU scenario, it is assumed that no methane capture system is installed until 2030 and that the amount of waste produced per year and per capita remains stable.</p>

          <p><img width="603" height="186" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-48.png"></p>
          <p>In the NDC scenario, it is assumed that methane capture systems are installed between 2020 et 2030 and it is considered a decrease of the amount of biodegradable waste going on landfills.</p>
          <p><img width="616" height="162" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-49.png"></p>
          <p>For the <strong>composting</strong> subsector, in the BAU scenario, the amount of composted waste per inhabitant per year between 2017 and 2030 is considered equal to the average of the last three (03) years from the inventory. This average is applied to the evolution of the national population from 2017 to 2030.</p>

          <p>For the incineration subsector, in the BAU scenario, the amount of incinerated waste per inhabitant per year between 2017 and 2030 is considered equal to the average of the last three (03) years from the inventory. This average is applied to the evolution of the national population from 2017 to 2030.</p>

          <p>Figure 46. amount of waste incinerated - NDC</p>
          <p>In the NDC scenario, the total amount of clinical waste incinerated is considered constant until 2030. It is considered that the incineration of MSW started in 2017. Between 2017 and 2021, the amount of incinerated MSW increased slowly du to testing phases. Then, between 2021 and 2030, it is assumed an important rise of the total amount of incinerated MSW associated among other things with the diversion of waste from landfills.</p>
          <p><img width="566" height="193" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-53.png"></p>
          <p>For the <strong>open burning</strong> subsector, in the BAU scenario, the amount of burned waste per inhabitant per year between 2017 and 2030 is considered equal to the average of the last three (03) years from the inventory. This average is applied to the evolution of the national population from 2017 to 2030.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>The animals’ feeding and associated productivity are constant, implying no change in the nitrogen excretion rate or enteric methane emission factor.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>The distribution of animals per manure management systems is maintained through time.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <h4>7.4.1.2. Mitigation actions – Livestock</h4>
                  <p>Contrary to the BAU, for the NDC scenario, improved feeding techniques for animal in housing (where feeding can be controlled) are considered. The action corresponds to the action: A5 - Optimizing animal feeding in order to reduce N2O and CH4 emissions</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>For this action, only cattle in housing is considered. The improved feeding techniques lead to:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>A decrease in nitrogen excretion rate (N inputs from feeding fitting better to animal needs). A 10% reduction for improved feeding is assumed.</p>
                      <p>A decrease in enteric CH4 (add of fat in feeding): according to the GACMO (Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Model) tool, this can lead to a reduction of 4% of CH4 emissions for 1% of fat added.</p>
                      <p>For the first sub-action (N inputs from feeding fitting better to animal needs), it is considered that it can be applied to <strong>all the cattle in housing.</strong> For the second sub-action, it is considered that <strong>only 50% of the herd</strong> is housed, as it can be costly.</p>
                      <p>Another mitigation action is considered: <strong>Increasing the time spent in pasture</strong> (see action A4 in table 3). This action applies only to cattle. In 2016, dairy cows spent 18% of their time in pasture. It is considered that in 2030, they will spend 25% of their time grazing. In 2016, other cattle spent 20% of their time in pasture. It is considered that in 2030, they will spend 25% of their time grazing. This action increase carbon sequestration in pasture.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>7.4.1.3. Activity data – Crop area, production and fertilization</h4>
                  <p>For the calculation of nitrogen from crop residues, the following crops are considered: wheat, maize, oats, hop, barley, rye, dry beans, potatoes, vetch. From 2009 to 2019, area and production data are taken from FAO stat. For all these crops, except for wheat, a constant area through time has been considered then. For wheat, the area is decreasing since 2009, and it is assumed that it would stabilize around 55,000 ha in 2030.</p>
                  <p>Areas of crops and crop production are similar in the BAU and NDC scenario</p>

                  <p>Two types of burning are included: burning of crop residues and pasture burning. The data are taken from the EFFIS reports. For crop residues burning, the average rate of burning has been estimated for 2009-2018 for wheat: 1.3% of the area is burnt. The rate has been maintained for the whole period. For pasture burning, the average area burnt for 2009-2018 (5,154 ha) has been used for projected years. There is no difference between the BAU and NDC scenario for this smaller source of emissions.</p>
              <h3>7.4.2. FOLU</h3>
              <p>The following chapters present in detail the assumptions for the BAU scenario of the FOLU sector. The BAU scenario considers the continuation of the situation and trends of the recent decade covered by the inventory:</p>
                  <h4>7.4.2.1. Forest land</h4>
                  <p>Forest area had been slightly decreasing (-0.1% between 2009 and 2016), mostly via the decrease of coppice forest. However, there was an increase in 2016. These are no significant long-term changes so the BAU scenario considers the forest area to remain stable with no further afforestation of deforestation in the period 2016-2035. For high forests, the mean area of the period 2013-2016 is used for all years after 2016. For coppice and shrubs, the value from the year 2016 is kept, since there is no clear trend in the period 2013-2016.</p>
                  <p><img width="387" height="226" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-70.png"></p>
                  <p>In the BAU scenario, the forest remains a net source for the whole period. CO2 absorptions from forest growth is kept stable since forest area is stable and parameters are kept the same.</p>
                  <p>Fuelwood harvesting level increases in consistency with the Energy sector, which projects an increase of +14% of TJ of fuelwood consumption between 2016 and 2030. This leads to an increase in fuelwood removals in forest of also +14% between 2016 and 2030.</p>
                  <p>Figure 58. Projected data for fuelwood harvest</p>
                  <p><img width="460" height="215" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-71.png"></p>
                  <p>Emissions due to <strong>wood harvesting</strong> are also kept constant in the BAU scenario. Emissions from disturbances are calculated through two elements:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>The dumpings of fuelwood (that is left in forest due to lack of efficiency of the harvest), which is a loss of C from the biomass. This value is kept constant, in line with the mean value of estimated dumpings for the inventory period.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>The fires. EFFIS dataset is used for the years 2017 and 2018. Two peaks of fires are estimated: 2011-2012 and 2017. From 2019 on it is assumed a hypothesis of stability from the mean area affected by fires (excluding the peaks), for the BAU scenario. Future big fires episodes cannot be predicted and so they are excluded of the projection. For the fires, C losses lead to CO2 emissions (reported in forest land) but also the combustion lead to CH4 and N2O emissions (reported in biomass burning).</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><img width="373" height="204" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-72.png"></p>
                  <h4>7.4.2.2. Cropland</h4>
                  <p>Cropland areas decreased regularly at -1,500 ha/y between 2009 and 2016. However, the dynamics of the different subcategories were very different: cultivated cropland and fruit trees were increasing, abandoned cropland was stable, and uncultivated cropland was decreasing.</p>
                  <p>In the BAU scenario, the rate of these changes has been kept constant for all subcategories, except for uncultivated cropland, where the decrease of the areas was leading to the total loss of the category in 2025. Once a minimum threshold of 10,000 ha (10% of the initial area of 2009) is hit, the assumption is that it remains at this level after.</p>
                  <p>The CO2 absorption from fruit trees continues its trend after 2016. Figure 60. Projected CO2 absorptions for cropland</p>
                  <p><img width="554" height="211" alt="image" src="img/ALB-NDC1-73.png"></p>
                            <h4>7.4.2.1. Grassland</h4>
                            <p>Grassland areas have been increasing during the period 2009-2016 (+12,000 ha, i.e. +2%, during the period), and a constant annual increase of 4,239 ha/y from 2011 to 2016, mostly from the conversion of Other Land. Actually, this conversion is likely to be from other conversion types (Forest to grassland, Cropland to grassland…) but with the current methodology to monitor land- use evolutions this is not known, and Other Land category is used as a remaining category.</p>
                            <p>This trend (+4,239 ha/y) is continued in the BAU scenario. It does not lead to any new emissions and removals in the BAU scenario.</p>
                            <h4>7.4.2.2. Wetland</h4>
                            <p>Wetland areas are stable, at 135 000 ha each year except for 2016 when it reaches 136,511 ha. This increase in 2016 is not significant enough to derive an increasing trend from it. Therefore, in the BAU scenario, the area remains constant at this 2016 level.</p>
                            <p>There is no <strong>carbon stock change</strong> associated with this category in the historical inventory and in the BAU scenario.</p>
                            <h4>7.4.2.3. Settlements</h4>
                            <p>Settlements area increases in the inventory period and this trend is continued for the projection. However, there is no <strong>carbon stock change</strong> associated with this category in the historical inventory and in the BAU scenario.</p>
                            <h4>7.4.2.4. Other land</h4>
                  <p>“Other land areas” is used as a remaining category. However, there is no carbon stock change associated with this category in the historical inventory and in the BAU scenario.</p>
              <h3>7.4.3. FOLU NDC scenario</h3>
              <p>The following presents in detail the assumptions for the NDC scenario of the FOLU sector. The NDC scenario considers some specific mitigation actions that aim to reduce emissions by sources and to increase absorptions by sinks. The BAU scenario is used as a baseline scenario, and the mitigation actions that make the NDC scenario differ from this baseline. The following mitigation actions are taken into account:</p>

                  <h4>7.4.3.1. Energy: changes in fuel mix, reduction of use of fuelwood. Moratorium on fuelwood (L1)</h4>
                  <p>As fuelwood harvesting is causing the majority of carbon losses in forests, to avoid and even eliminate illegal cuttings is targeted in different policies. Plus, the action on energy mix also helps to reduce this pressure on the forest resources. The evolution of fuelwood harvest is directly consistent with projections applied in the Energy sector regarding the evolution of fuel mix. The fuelwood consumption increases by 14% between 2016 and 2030 in the BAU scenario, while it decreases by 4% in the NDC scenario.</p>

                  <h4>7.4.3.2. New afforestation areas (L2)</h4>
                  <p>Total forest area has been almost stable, slightly decreasing (-0.1% between 2009 and 2016) in the past. Moreover, there is a large area of abandoned cropland, of shrubland and other land (with sparse vegetation) that could be afforested, naturally or via plantation programs. There is a significant opportunity for afforestation and hence, for more carbon sequestration in growing trees. In the TNC (2016), two afforestation scenarios were applied: 500 ha/y and 1000 ha/y.</p>
                  <p>Based on national circumstances, and considering the current trends, potential for afforestation areas is estimated at 300 ha per year.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, it can be considered that it is not the lack of potential area that is an issue, but the costs and organizational and monitoring costs of the plantation programs and the protection of growing trees that is at stake. For the NDC scenario, these ambitious afforestation areas are considered but with an increasing progressive rate (from 100 ha in 2021, to 300 ha/y from 2025 on).</p>
                  <h4>7.4.3.3. Improved management and monitoring to prevent wildfires (L3)</h4>
                  <p>While it is not possible to predict future episodes of wildfires, the improvement of monitoring and management of forest fires, as mentioned in national policy and plans (such as ECCS) will help reduce this risk. While the BAU scenario considers a mean risk of forest fires at 10 000 ha / year (less than bigger episodes but slightly higher than the other years to represent an increasing risk), the NDC considers a progressive reduction of 5% of this risk.</p>
                  <p>Exceptional events that cannot be predicted are excluded from the calculation. A background level is calculated, in line with the way Natural disturbances are treated in the Kyoto Protocol or the EU FOLU regulation. Albania pledge to continue efforts to reduce the scope and intensity of wildfires.</p>
                  <p>This exclusion of big events from the projection is made for both BAU and NDC scenario so it does not lead to a discrepancy between the NDC and the BAU.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in the NDC scenario, the prevention of wildfires for the background level is progressive and only reaches 5% in 2030 (compared to the BAU scenario).</p>

                            <h4>7.4.3.1. Improving efficiency of fuelwood harvest (L4)</h4>
                            <p>While the total annual harvested volume of fuelwood is estimated at a mean of 2.66 millions of m3 per year (FAO estimation), to be consistent with the Energy figures, it is estimated in the inventory, only a mean value of 1,09 millions of m3 of fuelwood harvested and actually used. It means there is a loss of efficiency in the harvesting process and that approximately 60% of the wood harvested is dumped. Improving the efficiency on use of fuelwood results in a decrease in wood dumpings. The reduction of these losses increases progressively from -0.25% in 2021 to - 3% in 2030, based on expert judgment with a conservative approach.</p>
                            <h4>7.4.3.2. Improved sustainable forest management (L5)</h4>
                            <p>This action aims to enhance carbon sequestration and protect biodiversity, including reforestation and restoration of degraded areas; development of official and certified wood harvesting, wood products and non-timber forest products Increase the protection areas (including the creation of natural corridors along rivers and ecotourism). This is mentioned in several national policy documents (ECCS; NSDI-II; NTP; IPARD; LANFPF; SPDBP; PDFS). Improved forestry management, applied progressively on 5000ha per year, allows a higher growth rate for the tree biomass in these areas. While the average annual above-ground biomass growth [Gw] is of 0.854 tdm/ha/y for coppice and high forest, and 1,0 tdm/ha/y for shrubs; a higher growth factor of 2,3 tdm/ha/y, from IPCC default values relevant for the country, is used.</p>
                            <h4>7.4.3.3. Improved sustainable grassland management (L6)</h4>
                            <p>This action is done to enhance carbon sequestration and protect biodiversity. Grassland mineral soil is improved by additional inputs from agricultural management (livestock management, more inputs, as seen in Agriculture sector). An input factor (Fi) of 1.11 is applied, using IPCC default values of table 5.5, to an increasing area of the total grasslands, from 2% in 2021 to 20% in 2030, based on expert judgment with national experts about available areas.</p>
                            <h4>7.4.3.4. Improved sustainable cropland management (L7)</h4>
                  <p>Development of agroforestry, as a widely recognized mitigation and adaptation opportunity, mentioned in national policy documents (ECCS; NSDI-II: NCCS), is projected to be progressively increasing to 100ha in 2030. Improvement of agricultural soil practices help storing carbon in soils in areas that increase progressively to 20% of cultivated cropland in 2030, based on expert judgment with national experts about available areas. A land use factor (FLU) of 0.8 and a management factor (FMG) of 1.02 is applied on these areas, using IPCC default values of table IPCC 2006 guidelines vol. 4 chapter 5 table 5.5.</p>

  <li id="fn73">To develop this table, three steps were followed. In the first step, for each sector (settlements, population and tourism) a list of actions was produced including all the actions indicated in the above- mentioned documents, presenting these actions exactly as they were presented in those documents. This resulted in very long lists (121 actions for settlements, 90 for tourism and 85 for populations) with a lot of duplication and some actions that were too general. In the second step, i) broad adaptation categories were defined taking into account a taxonomy that has been widely used internationally, and ii) actions were arranged per sector according to these broad categories. These involved merging and reformulating some of the actions that were included in the lists produced in step 3. The second step produced shorter list of actions for each sector. In the third step, the sector lists were triangulated to produce the table presented in this document. It is worth noting that given the cross-sectoral nature of coastal settlements and populations and the strong links between these sectors and between them and the coastal tourism the sector lists were very similar to each other, with significant coincidences (sometimes only the order changed).<a href="#fnref73">↩</a></li>
  <li id="fn74">The weights for co-benefits are 0.8 for development and 0.2 for mitigation. For ease of implementation, weights are 0.3 for institutional, 0.3 for technical, and 0.4 for financial. For each category, ratings of low, medium or high were associated respectively with 1, 2 or 3 points. The total weights equally consider the co-benefits and the ease of implementation criteria. The final priority level identifies as “Very high” the actions with a rating of &gt;4.5 points, as High those with 4.5&gt;x&gt;4.0, and with Medium priorities those with a rating &lt;4.0 (the maximum number of points an action could get is 6).<a href="#fnref74">↩</a></li>
