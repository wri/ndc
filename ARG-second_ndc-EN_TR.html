  <p> Update of Argentina's net emissions goal to 2030 </p>

  <h2> October 2021 </h2>

  <p> Buenos Aires, October 2021 </p>

  <p> Subject: Update of the net emissions goal to 2030 of the Argentina's Second NDC) </p>

  <p> Argentina has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, submitting the ratification document on September 21st, 2016. Therefore, the reviewed contribution presented in November 2016 replaced the intended National Determined Contribution (iNDC) according to paragraph 22nd of the Decision 1 / CP .21. </p>

  <p> In December 2020, aligned to the request of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, our Second NDC was submitted, committing to the goal of not exceeding the net emission of 359 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2030 . The proposed goal is absolute, unconditional and applicable to all sectors of the economy, in compliance with article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement. </p>

  <p> Argentina remains fully committed to ambitious national and global climate action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and has put the environmental and climate agenda at the center of its public policies priorities. </p>

  <p> Based on the best science available and recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, during the 2021 Leaders' Summit on Climate, our president Alberto Fernández announced an upgrade in the mitigation ambition of 2 percentage points. That represents a reduction in the limit to emissions of 27.7% compared to the First NDC submitted in 2016. </p>

  <p> The aim of this letter is to formally inform the UNFCCC secretariat that Argentina's updated goal is to not exceed the net emission of 349 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2030. This is the only modification made to the Second NDC submitted in December 2020. </p>

  <p> In terms of transparency, this submission includes the new text for goals chapter 5 "Goals" and a retrofitted version of title 6.2 from chapter 6 of our Second NDC "Information necessary for Clarity, Transparency and Understanding" in compliance with paragraph 4.8 of the Paris Agreement and with the provisions of paragraph 7 of decision 4 / CMA.1. </p>

  <p> Goal </p>

  <p> The Argentine Republic will not exceed the net emission of 349 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in the year 2030, applicable to all sectors of the economy. By 2030, Argentines will have knowledge of the adverse effects of climate change, the corresponding adaptation measures, and will have built capacities that allow them to respond in solidarity to the urgent challenge of protecting the planet. The climate policy of the Argentine Republic will have managed to increase the adaptation capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce the vulnerability of the different social, economic and environmental sectors, through measures that will prioritize communities and social groups in vulnerable situations and will incorporate the gender approach and intergenerational equity. All of this will be with a view to contributing to sustainable development, building a more equitable, just and caring society and achieving a response to climate change that is adequate and compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. </p>

  <p> The Argentine Republic's contribution to global efforts, based on the best available science, is both ambitious and equitable. However, it is relevant to note that both the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement establish that developed country Parties should take the initiative in combating climate change and its adverse effects through the provision and mobilization of financial resources. new and additional, including resources for technology transfer. </p>

  <p> In this sense, the Argentine Republic reaffirms the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities, as referenced in Principle 7 of the 1992 Rio Declaration, Articles 3 and 4 of the UNFCCC and the preamble of the Paris Agreement. This principle is, in turn, taken up and reaffirmed by its climate change law. </p>

  <p> In this sense, the policies and actions required to achieve the goal of this contribution will be implemented without prejudice to the use of the financial mechanisms provided by the Convention. Although the implementation of this Second NDC is not contingent on international support, Argentina understands that the support that developed countries can provide to fulfill their national ambition will generate significant global benefits. </p>

      <p> Although Argentina's Second NDC was not constructed from baselines or reference levels, the assumptions and methodological approaches used to understand the Determined Contribution at the National Level and estimate the corresponding emissions and removals, in order to guarantee the transparency of the document. </p>

      <p> Within the framework of the GNCC, the work to project emissions and removals was coordinated by the Secretariat for Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Innovation and carried out in conjunction with the technical staff of the enforcement agencies, who provided the modeling of the explanatory variables. These are key variables that account for the greatest changes in the level of GHG emissions in the different sectors of the country. These include population, gross domestic product, energy supply and demand, cattle stocks, agricultural production, and land use change. </p>

      <p> The projection of emissions and removals for 2030 was carried out using a simplified model consistent with the methodology and sources of emissions and removals estimated in the INGEI 2016, reported in IBA 3 in December 2019. In the INI of the IBA 3, reported in March 2020, contains the details of the methodology and the emission factors used in the modeling. To obtain the projections, various technical workshops were held to increase the ambition of the trajectories and maintain coherence and consistency between the different sectors. Each sector of the INGEI was modeled separately, and then the results were integrated and aggregated by the technical team of the National Directorate of Climate Change. </p>

      <p> In the case of the variables related to the energy sector, the same energy demand and supply models used for national energy planning were used. A growing demand for consumption by the population was contemplated, with energy efficiency measures in all sectors, a significant increase in the percentage of renewable energy and distributed generation, and a higher production of natural gas in absolute and relative terms. regarding oil production. In the transportation subsector, active policies were taken into account to increase the efficiency and use of natural gas and electricity. In turn, cutting with biofuels was included. </p>

            <p> For the PIUP sector, a slight increase in emissions is expected, given the growth of GDP. Compliance with the Kigali amendment for hydrofluorocarbon gases was contemplated. Regarding waste, a growth is projected in the percentage of urban solid waste disposed of in sanitary landfills, as well as in the capture of the methane that it originates. These measures would make it possible to maintain relative constancy in the sector's emissions. </p>

            <p> In the livestock subsector, a slight increase in emissions was seen, mainly driven by higher bovine, poultry and pig production. In the case of bovine livestock, an increase in production efficiency was contemplated. For agriculture, an increase in emissions is also expected due to increased production as a result of the use of fertilizers and improved crop yields. </p>

            <p> The decrease in emissions from the Forestry and Other Land Uses subsector stems from a strong boost to forest plantations and a drastic reduction in deforestation. </p>

            <p> A unified economic growth percentage was used for all sectors, which is consistent with the country's recovery and a sustained increase in population. </p>

            <p> The equity, justice and ambition of this Contribution are analyzed from various perspectives, understanding that there is no single indicator that can accurately reflect a globally equitable, fair and ambitious distribution of the efforts of the Parties. </p>

            <p> In the case of Argentina, the factors that explain the profile and trend of its emissions and removals do not respond to merely population or economic aspects, so the emission intensity indicators do not fully address equity, justice and ambition of the country's efforts. </p>

            <p> Likewise, as a developing country and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the Argentine Republic has the responsibility to promote actions and policies to achieve a sustainable, inclusive and balanced development model, in such a way that it guarantees not to leave anyone back and is consistent with the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. </p>

      <p> Although the country's emissions have increased in absolute terms compared to 1990, there is a decrease in the historical trend of recent years, after reaching a peak in 2007. This represented a maximum share of 0.95 % <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"> <sup> 4 </sup> </a> with respect to total global emissions for the same period. </p>

      <p> On the other hand, if we take 2005 as a reference, a reduction in net emissions is observed <a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"> <sup> 5 </sup> </a> of 4.3% in 2010 and of 9.6% in 2016. </p>

      <p> Given that policies and measures to respond to climate change must take into account the circumstances of each country and be articulated with national development priorities, it is considered that the Second NDC of the Argentine Republic is fair, equitable and ambitious, since: </p>

      <ul>

        <li>

          <p> It will maintain by 2030 a level of emissions similar to those reported in IBA 3 (2019); </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> Through its goal, it will maintain a participation percentage of less than 0.9% with respect to global emissions, according to the projection of the Emissions Gap Report 2019 <a href = "# fn6" class = "footnoteRef" id = " fnref6 "> <sup> 6 </sup> </a>. In this way, the share of Argentine emissions would remain below the maximum reached in 2007; </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> presents an absolute and unconditional goal applicable to all sectors of the economy, in compliance with article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement; </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> incorporates an adaptation component, including a specific goal; </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> In its construction, efforts have been made to achieve a balanced approach between the components of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation and to establish synergies between them; </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> it incorporates improvements in terms of transparency when presenting the Information necessary for Clarity, Transparency and Comprehension, in compliance with paragraph 4.8 of the Paris Agreement and with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Decision 4 / CMA 1, together with the Second Adaptation Communication. </p>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p> Argentina, in addition to considering the three central dimensions of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, understands that the concepts of ambition, justice and equity imply the need for plans and policies to be inclusive and take into account transversal contributions that allow promoting synergies in climate action. In line with this, the Second NDC advances in the design of a transversal approach to the gender dimension throughout the sectors, as well as notions aimed at guaranteeing the just transition of the workforce. Likewise, it is proposed to deepen the role of education as a motor of social change and to consolidate a robust link with the scientific and technological system as a source of knowledge and possible tools to tackle climate change. </p>

            <p> The Second NDC of the Argentine Republic represents an improvement compared to the update of the first NDC of 2016 since it presents an absolute goal that is 27.7% more ambitious and unconditional. </p>

            <p> Likewise, the current goal was estimated using a model based on INGEI 2016, reported in IBA 3, which represents a substantial improvement compared to INGEI 2014, corresponding to IBA 2 and used as the basis for estimating the goal. previous. This improvement in the quality of the inventories consists of a significant increase in the area represented, improvements in the calculation method and the emission factors used, greater coherence in the time series, a greater number of sources and sinks included - for example, emissions associated with the use of lubricants, greases and paraffin waxes, and of products as substitutes for substances that deplete the ozone layer—, among others <a href = "# fn7" class = "footnoteRef" id = "fnref7 "> <sup> 7 </sup> </a>. </p>
