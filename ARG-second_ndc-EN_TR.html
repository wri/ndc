<h2 id="prólogo">Foreword</h2>

<p>The pandemic has forced us to reflect on the importance of human health and its interrelation with the health of the planet. Climate change is a reality that is affecting humanity as a whole, which requires immediate and coordinated action from leaders around the world.</p>
<p>The world reconstruction of the post-pandemic is the opportunity we have to advance in this sense, where international cooperation and multilateralism inevitably play a leading role. "Rebuilding ourselves better" is the slogan that mobilizes us towards integral and sustainable development in a framework of just transition that allows us to stand up and emerge better from this crisis.</p>
<p>The Argentine Republic reaffirms its commitment to the Paris Agreement, in the light of science, and adopts climate change as State policy. For this reason, despite the economic and social situation derived from unsustainable indebtedness and the recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to advance the presentation of the Second National Contribution in 2020.</p>
<p>Our country pays a high price for the impact of climate change on its territory and on its social and productive structure, and makes a huge effort in mitigation and adaptation actions, the amount of which amounts to an estimated USD 15,000 million with international financing. Although ambitious, this is insufficient. Greater commitment and cooperation on the part of the more developed countries is imperative to expand it.</p>
<p>With true conviction, we assume the following commitments, which will guide Argentina's climate policy and action in the coming years:</p>
<p>First, and in response to the call to increase climate ambition, we have defined, with a view to 2030, a goal that will limit greenhouse gas emissions to a level 26% lower than the National Determined Contribution previously committed in 2016. Additionally, this new Contribution includes the Adaptation Communication, reinforcing the importance of this problem for countries like Argentina.</p>
<p>Second, we are committed to presenting our long-term low emission development strategy, with the goal of achieving carbon neutral development by 2050.</p>
<p>Third, in compliance with the National Law of “Minimum Budgets for Adaptation and Mitigation to Global Climate Change”, we will work through our National Cabinet on Climate Change, in the elaboration of a clear National Adaptation and Mitigation Plan and ambitious, which will guide the actions and agreements necessary to fulfill our commitments.</p>
<p>Let us assume together the challenge of promoting a just, ambitious and decidedly inclusive transformation, as a way of “rebuilding ourselves better”, aware of individual and collective responsibility for the environment.</p>
<p>Let us work in solidarity in the design of reconstruction packages that provide means of implementation that consider common but differentiated responsibilities, genuinely based on the circumstances of each country.</p>
<p>Let us promote - in the same spirit of solidarity - a high-level dialogue on equitable access to means of implementation, such as financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building to achieve climate commitments.</p>
<p>As Pope Francis teaches, "let us open our eyes and our hearts to act with a new sensitivity." The planet tells us enough. Let us assume the historical responsibility of becoming architects of a better world, rebuilt on the solid pillars of an environmentally sustainable, innovative, supportive and inclusive development.</p>

<p>This new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is a commitment to increase climate ambition, confirming our firm resolve to achieve a just transition towards comprehensive and sustainable development. Thus, the Argentine Republic expresses its concrete desire to contribute to climate action in a decisive and urgent manner.</p>
<p>A new awareness is required. Climate change is a concrete fact that translates into the reduction of the water flow in the Paraná basin (the main navigable route of MERCOSUR), in the losses of agricultural production or in the record temperature of 20 ° C in Antarctica . It is something that is evident in the pronounced droughts in different regions of the country, in the increase in forest and grassland fires, in the processes of desertification of the soils, in the increase in pronounced climatic events and in the appearance of zoonotic diseases. that are linked to deforestation, the destruction of natural habitats, among other signs of depletion of a development model that discards people and goods.</p>
<p>To take care of our common home and protect our people, we cannot pretend to be distracted by climate change or ignore that its consequences require concrete actions on the part of the State. For this reason, this second NDC includes implementation axes, such as the promotion of the energy transition, sustainable transport, the preservation of ecosystems (forests, wetlands, oceans, among others), the sustainable productive transformation (in agriculture, livestock, industry and services) and improvement in comprehensive waste management.</p>
<p>Likewise, to adapt to new climate scenarios, it is proposed to strengthen awareness, build capacities and implement measures to reduce vulnerability in communities, infrastructure and productive systems.</p>
<p>The goal is not to exceed 359 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent to the year 2030. Honoring this commitment will be an important challenge that will require the collective construction of a long-term vision of the country oriented to the common good.</p>
<p>This NDC was prepared within the framework of the National Climate Change Cabinet (GNCC), a formal inter-institutional work space that aims to develop and design public policies on climate change, through strategic articulation between the different areas of the national government, subnational governments and civil society actors.</p>
<p>We need to rethink the way we are doing things. Only fraternal dialogue will allow us to ensure a just transition that allows us to integrate the environment into development, ensuring that no one is left behind.</p>
<p>This challenge that we assume requires that we modify our lifestyles, that we adopt sustainable production and consumption practices, that we redefine our ties with nature, understanding that we are part of it and that we innovate to better rebuild our country and our planet in order to ensure conditions for the progress of our people.</p>

<h2 id="resumen-ejecutivo">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>The Argentine Republic adopts the representative, republican and federal form for its government. It is made up of 23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA). Its total area is 3,761,274 km2, of which 74% corresponds to the continental portion and 26% to the Antarctic Continent (including the South Orkney Islands) and the southern islands (Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich ) <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
. Likewise, Argentine maritime spaces <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
 represent a surface area of ​​6,683,000 km2, in addition to land spaces. In 2020, the estimated population is of the order of 45 million inhabitants, which are mainly concentrated in the main urban centers of the country.</p>
<p>The country has diverse and abundant natural resources. Its vast expanses of fertile land have historically determined the development of agricultural and livestock production chains that support food and biofuel production. Likewise, it is rich in energy resources, among which are hydrocarbon, hydraulic, wind, solar, as well as uranium deposits.</p>
<p>The heterogeneity in terms of availability of resources has its correlate in the country's productive structure, highlighting the insertion of different export sectors -particularly the agri-food sector- in the global and regional value chains. It is worth mentioning that the country's continental extension implies a significant demand for long-distance transport, both for passengers and cargo. Thus, the national geographic, climatic, demographic and institutional circumstances explain the main economic activities and their territorial ordering.</p>
<p>Everything previously described translates into a specific matrix of emissions by sources and absorption by sumps, which in 2016 implied a total net emission of 364 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), reflected in the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases.</p>
<p>Argentina is a highly vulnerable country, which needs to adapt, given that it has a great diversity of areas susceptible to the effects of climate change. An example of this are its low coastal areas; arid and semi-arid; with forest cover and exposed to forest deterioration; disaster prone; exposed to drought and desertification; and with fragile ecosystems, including mountainous ones.</p>
<p><strong>The Argentine Republic is committed to an absolute and unconditional goal, applicable to all sectors of the economy, of not exceeding the net emission of 359 MtCO2e in 2030. In addition, for the same year, there will be a reduction in vulnerability, increase the capacity for adaptation and strengthen the resilience of the different social, economic and environmental sectors through awareness-raising and capacity-building measures that allow the country and its population to respond in solidarity to the urgent challenge of protecting the planet.</strong></p>
<p>This Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) reflects a balanced treatment and improvement in the basic pillars of the fight against climate change. In this regard, the Argentine Republic increases its commitment to the mitigation goal presented in 2016, incorporates an adaptation goal in accordance with article 7.1 of the Paris Agreement, and includes a mention of the need to have the means to implement - Sufficient support to face the challenge of climate change, in line with its commitment to promote integral and sustainable development within the framework of a just transition.</p>
<p>The new goal is ambitious, since it is equivalent to a total reduction of 19% in emissions by 2030 compared to the historical maximum of emissions reached in 2007 <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
, and a reduction of 25.7% compared to the NDC previous. Likewise, and in compliance with article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement, the goal is absolute, unconditional and applicable to all sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>This Second NDC is at the same time fair and equitable, as the country would maintain in 2030 a participation percentage of 0.9% with respect to global emissions <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
. Additionally, in this Second NDC, efforts have been made to balance the approach between the components of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, establishing synergies between them. In terms of transparency, and in compliance with paragraph 4.8 of the Paris Agreement and with the provisions of paragraph 7 of decision 4 / CMA 1., improvements are incorporated when presenting the information necessary for Clarity, Transparency and Understanding .</p>
<p>Towards 2030, the Argentine Republic will carry out an energy transition, focusing efforts on promoting energy efficiency, renewable energies and promoting distributed generation, using natural gas as a transition fuel in this period. New nuclear and hydroelectric plants will have been put into operation and the hydrogen production chain will be developed. For the promotion of sustainable transport systems, policies derived from the Avoid-Change-Improve approach will have been implemented, promoting in particular energy efficiency and the greater use of natural gas, hydrogen, electricity and biofuels. Ecosystem protection policies (forests, wetlands, oceans, among others) will have been strengthened. In forestry, deforestation will have been drastically reduced and cultivated forests will have been boosted. For their part, livestock and agriculture will have increased their yields due to the use of new technologies based on the knowledge economy, the diversification of production systems and practices, increasing production without significant expansion of the effective area of ​​cultivated land. In the industrial and services sector, a structural change will have been implemented for sustainable production, in coordination with the private sector. Finally, the necessary infrastructure will have been generated so that the integral management of solid waste is carried out properly, within a framework of innovative practices using the circular economy as one of the available tools, among others,</p>
<p>Through this NDC the Second Adaptation Communication is presented. There it is established that adaptation capacity will be increased, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability in the different social, economic and environmental sectors. To achieve this, 35 adaptation measures divided into transversal and sectoral are proposed. These measures prioritize communities and social groups in situations of vulnerability, and incorporate a gender perspective and intergenerational equity.</p>
<p>The commitment assumed considers as a priority to eradicate poverty by promoting a just transition, addressing the needs of the entire population in order to guarantee comprehensive and sustainable development, without affecting future generations.</p>
<p>Along these lines, the Second NDC establishes 15 guiding axes that will guide the design, implementation and monitoring of all national adaptation and mitigation actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>United Nations 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals</li>
<li>Federalization</li>
<li>Participation</li>
<li>Human rights</li>
<li>
Just transition
</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Interculturality</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Community-based adaptation</li>
<li>Comprehensive risk management</li>
<li>Innovation, science and technology</li>
<li>Environmental education</li>
<li>Ecosystem-based adaptation</li>
<li>Energy security</li>
<li>Food safety</li>
<li>
Transparency, accuracy, comparability, consistency and completeness
</li>
</ul>

<p>Intra and inter-institutional articulation, as well as public participation, were central axes in the process of preparing this Second NDC. This document is the result of the joint work of 15 working groups of the national public administration, tables of federal articulation and working meetings with different sectors of society that, coordinated by the National Climate Change Cabinet (GNCC), allowed to achieve the necessary consensus for the collective construction of a vision of the Argentine Republic by 2030.</p>
<p>On the other hand - taking into account national circumstances and capacities - in order to achieve inclusive economic growth within the framework of sustainable development and at the same time deepen and accelerate the fight against climate change, access to means of implementation is essential. In this sense, although the implementation of this NDC is not contingent on international support, the Argentine Republic understands that the support that developed countries can provide to fulfill their national ambition will generate significant global benefits. For this reason, this Second NDC includes an initial analysis and prioritization of international support needs.</p>
<p>Finally, domestic follow-up and monitoring of the progress of the Second NDC is considered essential to achieve the effective implementation of climate action, both at the national and global levels.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that, as established in article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement and in accordance with Law No. 27,520 on Minimum Budgets for Adaptation and Mitigation to Global Climate Change (Climate Change Law), the Second NDC of the Argentine Republic is It will be updated every 5 years, following a process of continuous improvement regarding the accuracy, transparency and robustness of the information related to climate change policies.</p>
<p>Compliance with this Second NDC thus becomes a milestone on the path of the Argentine Republic towards a just, resilient, sustainable, supportive, inclusive and innovative transition, in which none of its citizens is left behind. Along these lines, and with a view to mid-century, the country will present its long-term low-emissions and resilient development strategy at the next Conference of the Parties to be held in Glasgow in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>

<p>Argentina adopts for itself a republican, representative and federal government, made up of 23 provinces and the Au- tonomous City of Buenos Aires. Its total area is 3,761,274 km2, of which 74% corresponds to the continental portion and 26% to the Antarctic Continent (including the South Orcadas Islands) and the southern islands (Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich)<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
 . Likewise, the Argentine maritime space<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
 represents an area of 6,683,000km2 in addition to land spaces. In the year 2020, its population is estimated at 45 million inhabitants, mainly concentrated in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, the provincial capitals and other urban centers across the country.</p>
<p>The Argentine Republic is endowed an abundance of diverse natural resources. Its large extensions of fertile land have historically determined the development of the agriculture and livestock production chains which sustain food and biofuel production. Moreover, it is rich in energetic resources, among which are hydrocarbon, uranium, wind, hydraulic, and solar. Its productive structure is heterogeneous, within which the insertion of different export sectors in regional and global value chains can be highlighted, particularly the agricultural and food sector. The great continental extension of the Argentine Republic entails an important demand for long-distance transportation, both for passengers and freight. The national geographic, climatic, demographic and institutional circumstances explain the main economic activities and, therefore, the land use planning, based on the availability of resources.</p>
<p>This in turn results in a specific matrix of greenhouse gasses emissions by sources and absorption by sinks, which reached a total net emission of 364 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) by 2016, as reflected in the National Green- house Gases Inventory. The Argentine Republic is a highly vulnerable country that needs to adapt given that it has a great diversity of areas susceptible to the effects of climate change: low-lying coastal areas; arid and semi-arid; with forest cover and exposed to forest deterioration; prone to disasters; exposed to drought and desertification; and with fragile ecosys- tems, including mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>The Argentine Republic is committed to an absolute, economy wide and unconditional goal of not exceeding the net emis- sion of 359 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2030. In addition, it establishes that, by the same year, the Argentine population will be aware of the adverse effects of climate change and the corresponding adaptation measures and will have built capacities that allow them to respond in solidarity to the urgent challenge of protecting the planet.</strong></p>
<p>This Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) reflects an improvement and a balanced treatment in the basic pillars of the fight against climate change. In this regard, the Argentine Republic increases its commitment to the mit- igation goal presented in 2016, incorporates an adaptation goal in accordance with article 7.1 of the Paris Agreement, and includes a mention of the need to have sufficient means of implementation to face the challenge of climate change, demonstrating thus its intention to promote sustainable development in the frame of inclusivity.</p>
<p>This new goal is ambitious, since it is equivalent to a total decrease in emissions of 19% by 2030, compared to the histor- ical peak reached in 2007<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
, and a reduction of 25,7% compared to the previous NDC submitted in 2016. Furthermore, the proposed goal is absolute, economy wide and unconditional, in compliance with article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement. It is also fair and equitable, with its fulfillment, Argentina would hold a participation of 0.9% with respect to global emissions6. In addition, in this Second NDC, efforts have been made towards a balanced approach between the components of miti- gation, adaptation and means of implementation, fostering synergies between them. In terms of transparency, improve- ments are incorporated through the presentation of the Information necessary for Clarity, Transparency and Understand- ing in compliance with paragraph 4.8 of the Paris Agreement and with the provisions of paragraph 7 of decision 4 / CMA 1.</p>
<p>Towards 2030, the Argentine Republic will carry out an energy transition, focusing its efforts on promoting energy effi- ciency, renewable energies and distributed generation, using natural gas as a transition fuel during this period. In turn, the hydrogen production chain will be developed, while new nuclear and hydroelectric plants will be put into operation. For the promotion of sustainable transport systems, policies derived from the Avoid-Shift-Improve approach will have been implemented, in particular promoting energy efficiency and the greater use of natural gas, hydrogen, electricity and biofu- els. Ecosystem protection policies (forests, wetlands, oceans, among others) will have been enhanced, deforestation will have been drastically reduced and cultivated forests will have been boosted. Livestock and agriculture production will have increased their yields due to the use of new technologies based on the knowledge economy and the diversification of pro- duction systems and practices, enabling greater total production without significant expansion in the cropland area. In the manufacturing, construction and services sectors, a structural change will have been implemented towards sustainable production in coordination with the private sector. Finally, the necessary infrastructure will have been built so that integral management of solid waste is adequately executed, within a framework of innovative practices that will regard circular economy as one in a series of available tools for the achievement of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Through this NDC, the Second Adaptation Communication is submitted. It establishes that adaptation capacity will be increased, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability in the different social, economic and environmental sectors. In order to address the territorial, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities that the Argentine Republic faces, 35 adaptation measures will be carried out in seven sectors. They will prioritize communities and social groups in situations of vulnerability incorporating a gender and intergenerational equity approach.</p>
<p>This commitment contemplates the eradication of poverty by the promotion of a just transition, addressing the needs of the entire population and guaranteeing integrated and sustainable development, without affecting future generations. In line with this, the Second NDC has been built based on 15 principles that guide the design, implementation , monitoring and evaluating of all national adaptation and mitigation actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>United Nations 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals</li>
<li>Federalization</li>
<li>Participation</li>
<li>Human rights</li>
<li>Just transition</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Interculturality</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Community-based adaptation</li>
<li>Comprehensive Risk Management</li>
<li>Innovation, Science and Technology</li>
<li>Environmental education</li>
<li>Ecosystem-based adaptation</li>
<li>Energy security</li>
<li>Food security</li>
<li>
Transparency, accuracy, comparability, consistency and completeness
</li>
</ul>

<p>Articulation and participation were central in the process of preparing this Second NDC. This document is the result of the joint work of 15 working groups of the national public administration, roundtables of federal articulation and working meetings with different sectors of society. All with the coordination of the National Cabinet of Climate Change (GNCC), this approach allowed to achieve the necessary consensus for the construction of a collective vision of the Argentine Republic by 2030.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the national capabilities and circumstances and capacities, the accomplishment of inclusive economic growth within the framework of sustainable development and the fight against climate change requires the provision of means of implementation. Although the implementation of this NDC is not contingent on international cooper- ation, the Argentine Republic understands that the support of developed countries in the fulfillment of its national ambition will bring about significant benefits globally. An initial analysis of needs and their priority order has been included in this Second NDC.</p>
<p>Follow-up and monitoring of the progress of the Second NDC is essential to achieve the effective implementation of cli- mate action at both the national and global levels. As established in Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement and in accordance with Law 27,520 on National Law on Adaptation and Mitigation on Climate Change, the Second NDC of the Argentine Republic will be updated every 5 years, pursuing a continuous improvement process in terms of accuracy, transparency and robustness of information related to climate change policies.</p>
<p>Compliance with this Second NDC thus becomes a milestone on the path of the just transition towards a resilient, sus- tainable, solidary, inclusive and innovative Argentine Republic where none of its citizens is left behind. With a view to the middle of the century, the country will present its long-term low-emission and resilient development strategy (LTS) at the next Conference of the Parties to be held in Glasgow in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="introducción">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The Argentine Republic has participated actively and uninterruptedly in international negotiations on environmental matters in general, and in those related to climate change in particular. In this sense, through Law No. 24,295, sanctioned in December 1993, our country approved the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a non-Annex I country. line, through Law No. 25,438 of June 2001, approved the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the Paris Agreement through Law No. 27,270 of September 2016.</p>
<p>As a result, the Argentine Republic presented its Anticipated and Determined Contribution at the National Level (iNDC) in October 2015. Following the principles, provisions and structure of the UNFCCC; Articles 3, 4, 7.10, 7.11 and 13 of the Paris Agreement; already established in Decisions 1 / CP.19, 1 / CP.20, 1 / CP.21, 1 / CP.24, 4 / CMA.1, 9 / CMA.1 and 18 / CMA.1, the iNDC was revised and updated in 2016, and presented in the framework of the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in Morocco, in compliance with the requirements of paragraph 24 of Decision 1 / CP.21. In that updated version, the</p>
<p>República Argentina established an absolute goal of not exceeding the net emission of 483 MtCO2e in the year 2030, increasing its level of ambition and transparency with respect to the first presentation. Also, as part of this NDC, the First Adaptation Communication was presented.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the main elements established in article 2 of the Paris Agreement, the present Second NDC of the Argentine Republic is structured incorporating components of adaptation, mitigation, and the necessary means of implementation, as well as mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation and upgrade. Likewise, and for the purposes of greater contextual clarity, additional information is provided on national circumstances and the country's development vision for the year 2030.</p>
<p>In response to the call to increase climate ambition, in this Second NDC the Argentine Republic presents a new absolute mitigation goal for the year 2030, expressed in millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) that is complemented with an adaptation goal, to provide a comprehensive response to the climate crisis.</p>
<p>For the purposes of greater clarity, the information necessary for Clarity, Transparency and Comprehension is included in this Second NDC, as established in Decision 18 / CMA.1, and for the Second Adaptation Communication, in accordance with what is established in articles 7.10 and 7.11 of the Paris Agreement.</p>


<h2>2. National circumstances</h2>
<h3>2.1 Characterization of the country</h3>

<p>The Argentine Republic adopts the representative, republican and federal form for its government. It is made up of 23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA). Its total area is 3,761,274 km2, of which 74% corresponds to the continental portion and 26% to the Antarctic Continent (including the South Orkney Islands) and the southern islands (Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich ) <a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
. Likewise, the Argentine maritime spaces <a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
 they represent an area of ​​6,683,000 km2 in addition to land spaces. The extension of the country allows the existence of thermal conditions that vary from warm in the north, to cold in the extreme south and in the heights of the mountainous areas and the Andes Mountains. It has a great biodiversity - currently threatened by the climate crisis - divided into 18 ecoregions, before which its conservation is a high priority.</p>
<p>The country has an extensive maritime space with a high degree of hydrological and geomorphological complexity that offers diverse habitats for a great variety of species. The La Plata Basin, the second most important in South America due to its geographical extension and the flow of its rivers, is also integrated into the national territory, providing important ecosystem services and fishing resources of commercial interest that support globally relevant fisheries.</p>
<p>By 2020, the Argentine Republic has an estimated population of 45 million inhabitants, 49% of which are males and 51% females <a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>
, with a total annual population growth rate of 0.958% <a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>
. There are 26 ethnic groups of indigenous peoples in the country that, together with the Afro-descendant population, represented 2.71% of the total population in 2010 <a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>
. 92% of the population is urban <a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>
 and 39% lives in the Metropolitan Region of Buenos Aires <a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>In 2019, the country registered a value of 0.714 in the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality <a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>
. Likewise, the population below the income poverty line in 2020 amounted to 40.9%, with 10.5% of the population below the indigence line <a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>
, and the highest percentage for both indicators being concentrated in the age group from 0 to 14 years old <a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>The Argentine Republic has abundant and diverse natural resources. Its large expanses of fertile land and the development of agricultural and livestock production chains support the production of food and biofuels. Likewise, its extensive maritime coastline and rich continental waters allow the fishing industry to develop. It also has significant reserves of gas, minerals and strategic metals, necessary for the transition to a low carbon economy based on renewable energy generation, affordable energy supply and sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>Due to its geographical and climatic characteristics, Argentina presents a high potential for the generation of renewable energies, since it has good radiation levels in the northwest region and appropriate winds in the Patagonian region, to which is added significant potential in terms of hydrogen production.</p>
<p>The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was USD 12,069 in 2018, USD 9,962 in 2019, and USD 8,317 in the first two quarters of 2020 <a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>The country's productive structure is characterized by its heterogeneity and diversity, highlighting the insertion of export sectors in regional and global value chains, particularly in the agri-food sector.</p>



<p>The main domestic economic sectors are industrial -especially related to food processing- followed by services, transportation, communications, real estate activities and agriculture.</p>
<p>For its part, foreign trade is strongly led by the export of primary products and manufactures of agricultural origin (MOA). Indeed, according to figures for 2019, the main export complexes were olea-ginous (29% share of the total), cereal (15.5%), automotive (10.9%), oil-petrochemical (7.8%), and the metal miner (7.8%) <a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>While in the domestic services sector the financial one stands out, with a recent development of services based on knowledge and innovation with a high component of new technologies, which adds to the international expansion of the tourism sector as a generator of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the methodology used to measure GDP does not incorporate Unpaid Household and Care Work (TDCNR). In this sense, based on the analysis carried out by the National Directorate of Economy, Equality and Gender, it was determined that the contribution of the TDCNR to GDP is approximately 15.9% <a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>
.</p>
<h4>Situation: Covid-19 and Public Debt</h4>
<p>2020 has been a particularly complex year for the country as it suffered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the framework of a recessive process that began in 2018, aggravated by a strong external debt. As of the third quarter of 2020, the national economy accumulated a drop in GDP of 11.8% <a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>
, a situation that had an impact on social and employment indicators.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the national government prioritized the protection of the life and health of the population, strengthening the health system through investments in the sector. At the same time, assistance policies were deployed, both for companies and individuals, in accordance with the heterogeneity of the Argentine labor market, in which formal and informal sectors coexist, with asymmetries in terms of income distribution.</p>
<p>Thus, the Argentine Republic was immersed in the double challenge of responding to the pandemic while carrying out a process of sovereign debt restructuring <a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>Within this framework, and despite the difficult economic and social situation, the national government decided to advance the presentation of the second NDC - scheduled for 2021 - to this year, in order to contribute to global climate action and align recovery packages. economic to the commitments established in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<h4>Health and education</h4>
<p>The Argentine health system is characterized by providing universal coverage, which means that whoever resides or transits the national soil can receive free assistance in public health care centers.</p>
<p>Infant mortality per 1,000 live births is 9.3; a significant decrease having been achieved between 2002-2015 <a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>
 going from 16.8 to 9.7 and remaining stable since then.</p>
<p>State education is free at all levels, including university. The period of compulsory schooling is 14 years and the percentage of illiteracy in the 10-year-old population is 1.9%. with a decreasing trend since in 1991 it was 3.7% and in 2001, 2.6% <a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>Regarding the scientific and technological system, the historical educational level of the population has allowed Argentine science to have traditionally had a high level of development, becoming an important national asset with strong potential for expansion.</p>



<h4>Energy and transportation</h4>
<p>As mentioned, Argentina is rich in natural energy resources, among which are hydrocarbon, hydraulic, wind and solar, as well as uranium deposits.</p>
<p>In 2019, the total domestic supply of primary energy reached 81 thousand ktoe. 87% of the energy produced locally comes from fossil origin, 54% corresponding to natural gas, 31% to oil and derivatives, and 1% to mineral coal. Hydraulic and nuclear energy contribute 4% and 3%, respectively, and non-conventional renewables (biomass, small hydroelectric, wind and solar) 6%. <a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>2. 3</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Fossil fuels are used mainly for the production of electrical energy of thermal origin (not nuclear), for residential and industrial consumption (gas distributed by networks), and for transport and industry (refined liquids). Demand is driven by population growth, the evolution of the economy and the large territorial extension, which impacts the consumption of transportation fuels. Energy resources are located mostly distant from consumption centers, so an extensive energy transport and distribution infrastructure is needed to supply demand.</p>
<p>6% of electricity generation in 2019 was based on non-conventional renewable sources. Wind generation represents 42% of this energy, solar 3%, small hydroelectric plants 43% and other non-conventional renewables 12%. Biodiesel production reached 2.1 million tons in 2019, of which 47% was destined for export, while bioethanol production reached 1.07 million m3 <a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>In 2019, the transportation sector accounted for 33% of the country's energy demand, the residential sector for 26%, the industrial sector for 26%, the agricultural sector for 8%, and the commercial and public sectors for 7%. <a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>
<p>In the residential sector, the greatest demands are associated with population concentration and climatic conditions. According to the 2010 Population Census, at the residential level, 98% of households had electricity through the network and 57% used natural gas from the network as the main fuel for cooking and 40% LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) in its different commercial presentations, carafe, tube or in bulk <a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>In the industrial sector, the greatest demands come from industries related to food processing, beverage and tobacco production, iron and steel production, the non-metallic minerals industry (including lime and cement), chemical products, pulp, paper and printing production and the non-ferrous metals industry (including aluminum). In 2019, the industrial sector was the second largest consumer of natural gas, after power plants.</p>
<p>The significant participation of the transport sector in the demand for energy is explained by the continental extension of the Argentine Republic, which entails an important demand for long-distance transport, both for passengers and cargo. The productive activities are spatially distributed in the national territory, while the ports, through which the international demand is satisfied, as well as the large cities from where the internal demand arises, are concentrated in a few locations of the national territory. This consumption was supplied in 2019 with 39% diesel, 36% naphtha, 12% natural gas, 9% biofuels and 4% other fuels <a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>The road network is made up of about 40 thousand km of national roads <a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>
, which constitute the primary trunk network, 189 thousand km of provincial routes and approximately 285 thousand km of roads administered by the municipalities, making up the tertiary road network. Urban passenger mobility by buses, private vehicles and railways is concentrated in the Metropolitan Area of ​​Buenos Aires (AMBA <a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>
), which concentrates more than a third of the country's population, and in the urban agglomerations of the provinces of Córdoba, Santa Fe, Mendoza and Tucumán. The Argentine automobile fleet is 14 million vehicles, of which 10.6 million are automobiles, 2.6 million light utility vehicles, 678 thousand are cargo trucks and 84 thousand are buses for passenger transport <a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>30</sup></a>
.</p>


<p>It should also be clarified that regarding the Hydrofluorocarbon gases (HFCs) regulated by the Montreal Protocol and the Kigali amendment, production amounts to 5,200 tons per year. The main consumers of these gases are the refrigeration and air conditioning equipment manufacturing and services sector, accounting for 89.4% of the total <a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>
.</p>
<h4>Agriculture, Livestock and Forests</h4>
<p>In 2019, the sown area was 40,507,400 total hectares, of which 41.7% corresponded to soybeans; 23.4% to corn and 17.1% to wheat <a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>
. This activity is complemented by the livestock sector. In this sense, livestock activity is mainly deployed in the extensive grasslands of the Pampeana, Espinal and humid Chaco region, where cattle stocks totaled about 52.9 million head in 2020 <a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>
, while in 2019 13.9 million head were slaughtered <a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>
. Although most of the beef production is for domestic consumption, in 2018 28.4% of the production was destined for export <a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Argentine Republic has an extensive area of ​​native forests, which amounts to 53,654,545 hectares <a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>
. Due to the different geographical, geological, topographic and climatic conditions, there are different types of native forests, which are located mainly in seven forest regions: Paranaense Forest, Yungas, Chaqueño Park, Espinal, Andean Patagonian Forest, Monte y Delta and Islas del Paraná River, each one subject to different natural and human pressures. The annual percentage of native forest loss showed a decrease since the enactment of National Law No. 26,331 on Minimum Budgets for the Environmental Protection of Native Forests in December 2007, going from an average of 368 thousand ha / year during the period 2002-2013 at an average of less than 179 thousand ha / year during the 2014-2018 period <a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>
. In terms of cultivated forests, the country currently has an area of ​​approximately 1.4 million hectares.</p>
<h4>Waste</h4>
<p>In the Argentine Republic, the average daily waste generation for 2019 was 1.15 kg per capita, which represented about 49,300 tons per day, and around 18 million tons per year. From the analysis of the composition of the MSW entered into the sanitary landfills, the content of potentially compostable materials with percentages greater than 40% stands out, being feasible the use of biological treatment methodologies to reduce the volume and mass of waste to be sent to final disposal. The proportion of paper and cardboard waste remains between 13% and 20% of the total. Plastic waste went from being insignificant in 1972 (on the order of 2-3%), to representing between 15 and 20% from 2005 to the present. The glass maintains a presence with a sustained value over time of the order of 3 to 6%; while disposable diapers and dressings show growth since 2001, reaching values ​​of 11%. With regard to recovery values, the paper and cardboard industry reaches 50%, while the plastic recycling industry contributes less than 10%. 1.2 million tons of steel are also recovered. In the case of the glass industry, there is still not enough reliable data on the quantities recovered or recovered. while the plastic recycling industry contributes less than 10%. 1.2 million tons of steel are also recovered. In the case of the glass industry, there is still not enough reliable data on the quantities recovered or recovered. while the plastic recycling industry contributes less than 10%. 1.2 million tons of steel are also recovered. In the case of the glass industry, there is still not enough reliable data on the quantities recovered or recovered.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to hazardous waste, its generation is closely linked to the level of industrial activity, so that growth in activity will inevitably be accompanied by a higher level of generation of these wastes.</p>

<h3 id="marco-legal-ambiental">2.2 Environmental legal framework</h3>

<p>At the national level, the National Constitution, amended in 1994, enshrines in its article 41 the right of all Argentines to a healthy, balanced environment, suitable for human development and for productive activities to satisfy present needs without compromising those of future generations, as well as the duty to preserve it.</p>
<p>Likewise, it empowers the National Congress to dictate minimum environmental protection budget regulations, which establish a uniform environmental protection for the entire national territory within the framework of a federal country in which the provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires retain dominance. originating from their natural resources and may dictate complementary regulations. These norms regulate certain activities in order to promote the care of natural resources and the environment in general through the conservation, management, sustainable use and restoration of ecosystems. Likewise, they guarantee access to public environmental information and public participation.</p>
<p>Argentine environmental law is governed by principles that must be used when interpreting and applying the rules. In particular, the General Environmental Law No. 25,675 lists the preventive, precautionary, progressive, consistency, responsibility, subsidiarity, sustainability, intergenerational equity, solidarity and cooperation principles.</p>
<p>As a result of the federal nature of the government system in the Argentine Republic, the Federal Council for the Environment (COFEMA) was created in 1990 as a permanent organism for the agreement and elaboration of a coordinated environmental policy among the member states (the provinces, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and the National Government). To this end, the National Executive Power proposes to the COFEMA Assembly the issuance of recommendations or resolutions for the adequate validity and effective application of the minimum budget laws, the provincial complementary laws and their regulations in the different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In December 2019, the Argentine Republic ratified its political commitment in the fight against climate change by approving Law No. 27,520 on Minimum Budgets for Adaptation and Mitigation to Global Climate Change (Climate Change Law) <a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>
 and its Regulatory Decree No. 1030/2020 <a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>
. Said law reaffirms and regulates the international commitments assumed, and strengthens the national climate policy and sub-national planning, establishing minimum environmental protection budgets to guarantee adequate actions, instruments and strategies for adaptation and mitigation to climate change throughout the world. National territory.</p>
<p>This norm complements the principles established in the aforementioned General Environmental Law, adding that of common but differentiated responsibilities at the international level, the transversality of climate change in State policies, the prioritization of the needs of social groups in conditions of vulnerability to climate change, and the complementarity of adaptation actions with mitigation actions. Likewise, it institutionalizes the National Climate Change Cabinet (GNCC) as a national governance body for the coordinated and consensual design of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies, and stipulates the preparation of the National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Plan (PNAyMCC) , defined as the set of strategies, measures, policies, and instruments developed to comply with the objectives of the law. At the same time, it establishes the preparation of the Jurisdictional Response Plans, which are the adaptation and mitigation plans that the provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires must prepare. It also creates the National Information System on Climate Change, as a central tool for transparency and promotion of information.</p>
<p>Public participation and access to information are key objectives set out by law, which must be understood as a priority by the national authority and by the provinces when implementing the regulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in 1988, Argentina signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which was ratified on September 18, 1990. In 2016, at the meeting held in Rwanda, the Amendment was approved from Kigali. In 2019 Argentina ratified this amendment, which aims to reduce the consumption and production of HFCs, which, despite not being substances that deplete the ozone layer, are powerful greenhouse gases that are used with often as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances.</p>
<p>In October 2020, through Law No. 27,566, the National Congress approved the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean (Escazú Agreement ) <a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>
. The purpose of said Agreement is to “guarantee the full and effective implementation in Latin America and the Caribbean of the rights of access to environmental information, public participation in environmental decision-making processes and access to justice in environmental matters, as well as the creation and strengthening of capacities and cooperation, contributing to the protection of the right of each person, of present and future generations, to live in a healthy environment and sustainable development ”.</p>
<p>Finally, it is relevant to note that the country recently sanctioned the so-called "Yolanda Law" No. 27,592 <a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>
, which guarantees comprehensive and mandatory training in the environment, with a perspective of sustainable development and with special emphasis on climate change, for all people. that they perform in the public function, in the different powers and levels of the national government. In addition, the Executive Power sent to the National Congress a bill on Comprehensive Environmental Education that seeks to incorporate the new paradigms of environmental sustainability into the fields of formal and non-formal education.</p>

<h3>2.3 Governance</h3>

<p>The Argentine Republic considers climate change as a State policy, so it structures its governance scheme understanding the seriousness and urgency of confronting it, the multidimensional and cross-cutting nature of its impacts, and the need to generate a profound paradigm shift. in the development model. It is in this sense that the Climate Change Law institutionalizes the National Climate Change Cabinet, chaired by the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, within which four work instances have been established: Meeting of Ministers, Table of Focal Points, Table of Provincial Articulation and Extended Table.</p>
<p>This Second NDC, as part of the climate policy, was elaborated through the articulation between all the instances of the GNCC, resulting in a new commitment agreed in a participatory, inter-institutional and interjurisdictional manner.</p>
<h4>Meeting of Ministers</h4>
<p>It is the work instance in which the highest national ministerial authorities of the various areas of the National Public Administration are present. It is chaired by the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers and is made up of all the ministerial portfolios of the National Executive Power.</p>
<h4>Focal Points Table</h4>
It brings together political and technical representatives from all areas of the National Public Administration. These, in turn, are organized into 15 Working Groups ( <a href="#gobernanza">figure 1</a> ) that, through successive technical and political interactions, provide their contributions and comments within the framework of their sectoral and transversal competences, in order to build a common vision of the country. on climate action.<p></p>
<p><img src="ARG-NDC2_1.png" style="width:5.51564in;height:5.51562in"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Working Groups of Focal Points of the National Climate Change Cabinet.</p>
<h4>Provincial Articulation Table</h4>
<p>The COFEMA Technical Commission on Climate Change participates in the Provincial Articulation Table of the GNCC. This commission has the representation of each of the jurisdictions through a titular and an alternate focal point, who participate in general, regional or bilateral meetings, identifying common needs and exchanging experiences in the joint and associative search for solutions that go beyond territorial limits. Through this articulation space, activities are carried out that favor the development of Subnational Climate Change Response Plans, such as meetings and training and exchange workshops.</p>
<p>The commitment assumed by the provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires in this federal framework is evidenced through the consolidation of specific work structures on the subject in sub-national governments, as well as progress in the enactment of local legislation that reflects climate planning and governance criteria.</p>
<h4>Extended Table</h4>
<p>The Expanded Table is the articulation space through which the integration of the contributions of various sectors and actors, both public and private, is achieved. This Roundtable brings together various actors, such as: civil society organizations; scientists; universities and study centers; unions; youth groups; chambers, councils and business federations; professional associations; citizen groups; media; social movements; municipalities; indigenous communities; legislative power; judiciary and political parties. It is complemented with a Citizen Participation Mechanism in virtual format that allows any citizen or organization to send their contributions, suggestions and considerations on the different GNCC work instances.</p>
<h4>Advisory Board</h4>
<p>The law establishes the creation of the GNCC External Advisory Council, of a permanent consultative nature, to perform technical assistance and advisory functions in the development of public policies on climate change. The Advisory Council is made up of scientists, experts, researchers, representatives of environmental organizations, unions, indigenous communities, universities, academic and business entities, public and private research centers, as well as members of political parties with parliamentary representation.</p>

<h2 id="visión-2030">3. Vision 2030</h2>

<p>The Argentine Republic is committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the collective fulfillment of the objective of the UNFCCC. For this reason, as a result of the intra and inter-institutional articulation work coordinated by the National Climate Change Cabinet, a shared vision of the country for the year 2030 has been drawn up, as a horizon that guides the implementation of this Second NDC, the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>This vision of a sustainable, inclusive and innovative Argentina by 2030 is presented for information purposes, it is not part of the goal of the Second NDC, it is based on the best available science, and it was elaborated taking into account national circumstances as a point of departure. It also considers the principle of equity in the global effort, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities.</p>
<p>Reaching it will imply the inter-institutional, inter-jurisdictional and collective work of the different national and sub-national actors. It is in this sense that the Argentine Republic will promote from 2021 a broad dialogue at the national level that will allow the consolidation of a National Plan for Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change, an instrument that, as established by the Climate Change Law, will internalize the 2030 vision, transforming it into a roadmap with concrete actions for the implementation of this Second NDC.</p>
<h3>Sustainable economy and finance</h3>
<p>By 2030 the Argentine Republic will achieve inclusive, supportive, stable, federal, sovereign and dynamic social and economic development. In this sense, the main challenges to be addressed include the significant reduction of multidimensional and extreme poverty, the eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition, the increase of the resilience of people and social groups in vulnerable situations against to the adverse effects of climate change, the reduction of labor informality, the coverage of housing and habitat deficits, the solution of infrastructure deficiencies and the deconcentration of the population in the Metropolitan Area of ​​Buenos Aires (AMBA). In economic matters, macroeconomic volatility and the structural shortage of foreign exchange will be reduced,</p>
<p>At the macroeconomic level, the construction of a general scheme of consistency that allows a path of greater stability, productive dynamism and inclusion, requires the recovery of public credit as a necessary condition. In this sense, the recent sovereign debt renegotiation agreement and the change in priorities in the allocation of the National Budget - which increases the weight of investment in infrastructure, the care economy, and the inclusion of the gender perspective - will constitute the basis on which to start the process.</p>
<p>To this end, continuous and balanced economic growth between sectors and regions of the country will be promoted, the efficiency indicators of the social security system will be improved, and a pension system with a high coverage rate will be developed, while the gap will be progressively reduced. income between genders.</p>
<p>The results will be translated into the stabilization of the exchange rate and the improvement in the income distribution indicators, which will encourage savings in local currency, positively boosting the expectations of the agents that will determine the development of a capital market, and favoring mortgage credit, within the framework of a fiscal balance compatible with an inclusive and sustainable long-term growth path.</p>
<p>By 2030, it is expected to have a diversified and strengthened productive structure, a balanced sectoral development at the national level with a federal sense, and a State in harmonious relationship with the private sector. For this, the national economic policy, framed in a vision of socio-environmental integrity, will include various areas of the Government and all sectors with export capacity or potential, designing policies to encourage sustainable economic development.</p>
<h3>Productive development</h3>
<p>The growth of production towards 2030 will be the result of a structural change for sustainable production, made up of active policies that promote economic recovery, with the promotion of exports, the growth of the domestic market and the increase in productivity as an axis. and efficiency based on measures that promote creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>Growth and sustainable development will generate the economies of scale necessary for a competitive positioning of national production in international markets, by reducing average costs, genuinely boosting the country's export capacity in the context of effective regional integration, and without neglecting the development of the most vulnerable sectors. This boost will be achieved through a development banking system, adequate land use planning, the improvement of the productive and logistical infrastructure, the supply of affordable energy, and an inescapable commitment to the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainable development in all production processes.</p>
<p>In this way, the productive development policy will itself be a regional development policy with a direct impact on the territory. For this, new industrial park programs will be carried out, innovations and technologies for transport and logistics in general will be adopted, promoting a policy aimed at promoting local production and increasing exports.</p>
<p>In terms of production processes, by 2030 there will be a significant increase in the degree of modernization, energy efficiency and rationality in the use of resources, which will be possible from the internalization of a comprehensive vision of the life cycle of products and active financing policies. In particular, direct support programs for SMEs and cooperatives will be promoted, as well as strategic sectors such as renewable energy providers, mining, medical equipment, naval, rail and automotive industry, industry 4.0, biotechnology, nanotechnology, services. software and sustainable mobility, among others. In addition, hydrogen value chains will be developed, the use of which will pave the way to sustainable, low-carbon industry and transport.</p>
<p>Given that the transition towards a resilient and low-emission development will increase the demand for certain minerals and metals, the development of sustainable management of extractive industries will be strategic for our country. To this end, the exploration of reserves and the exploitation of mineral resources will be promoted based on the adoption of the best international techniques and practices, ensuring a sustainable and responsible management of the activity.</p>
<p>The Argentine Republic carries out initiatives that contribute directly to supporting the change towards sustainable consumption and production patterns (SCP). Through these programs, resource efficiency, pollution prevention, corporate responsibility, sustainable purchases, and the promotion of sustainable food and construction systems are promoted, improving their environmental performance. In order to guarantee its implementation in an integrated manner, the Sustainable Consumption and Production Strategy will be drawn up, based on scientific evaluations, inter-ministerial cooperation and inter-sector dialogue.</p>
<p>Likewise, by 2030 the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol will be fulfilled, consolidating a regulatory framework that guarantees the elimination of the consumption of HFCs in line with the control measures contained in the Amendment, and which will be complemented with the definition and implementation of a national strategy that promotes the conversion of the main consumer sectors of these gases.</p>
<p>The combination of programmed public policy measures and actions will result in a network of companies that, developing their activities in the country, will respect the human right to a healthy environment and the sustainable use and conservation of ecosystems, especially those native forests, wetlands, peatlands, natural grasslands and other ecosystems with significant carbon contents, as well as biological diversity, paying special attention to the close and sensitive relationship of these ecosystems with indigenous peoples, Afro-descendant communities, tes, and rural and peasant populations.</p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>Regarding the energy sector, by the year 2030, the Argentine Republic will have implemented policies, actions and measures to promote a just energy transition that guarantees the affordable supply of energy, in a clean, reliable and sustainable way, accompanying economic and population growth. and incorporating the responsible use of energy through the promotion of energy efficiency as a guiding principle. The energy matrix by 2030 will be more inclusive, dynamic, stable, federal, sovereign <a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>
 and sustainable, based on the significant potential of clean sources from wind, solar, hydroelectric and bioenergy, as well as the development of nuclear energy, and other energy vectors such as hydrogen, which will play a key role in achieving the energy transition.</p>
<p>Likewise, this path outlined includes in the medium term a greater use of natural gas as a transition fuel in thermal power plants, through the incorporation of flexible, quick-start machines that will replace other more carbon-intensive and less efficient fossil fuels. .</p>



<p>In 2030, the generation of electricity from renewable sources will have increased significantly, and there will be a growing infrastructure for distributed generation. At the same time, a notable increase in cogeneration is expected in thermal power plants and the incorporation of large emission-free plants. Finally, specific plans for adaptation to the impacts of climate change will be implemented in order to achieve a resilient electricity system.</p>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<p>The transport sector will focus by 2030 on intermodality and will promote optimization and flexibility criteria through virtuous interaction between the different means of transport, enhancing the ability to transfer goods and people according to the realities and specific needs for the socioeconomic development of each of the country's regions.</p>
<p>Likewise, active mobility will have been favored through urban land use planning and sustainable energy matrices will be promoted, focusing on gasification, biofuels, electrification of mobility and the use of hydrogen. By 2030, effective energy efficiency measures will have been implemented in all modes of transport with an Avoid-Change-Improve approach as an approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the sector and promoting the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Likewise, measures will be planned and implemented to strengthen transport systems with a focus on resilience and sustainability, taking into account the new climatic parameters.</p>
<h3>Agriculture, livestock, fishing and forests</h3>
<p>Agricultural and agroindustrial production will continue to represent one of the most significant contributions to the national GDP, as a source of employment and as a generator of foreign exchange. In 2030, the increase in total grain production will occur thanks to the increase in agricultural yields and without implying a significant increase in the effective agricultural area. To this end, public policy instruments will be put into operation that generate incentives for innovative agricultural intensification, promoting the implementation of new technologies and practices, and the diversification of production systems will be promoted to consolidate a resilient and sustainable food system. In turn, an increase in meat production is expected to supply the domestic market and improve export performance, through a two-way mechanism: on the one hand, the increase in the productivity of the herd and, on the other, the increase in the volume of meat produced per animal slaughtered. Likewise, dairy cattle production rates will continue to increase through genetic improvements and the adoption of technologies and good practices.</p>
<p>In relation to native forests, there will be capacities for their sustainable management and preservation based on a social inclusion approach. More effective tools for monitoring and planning will be adopted, and sustainable forest use will be promoted by adding greater competitiveness in timber and non-timber value chains. The implementation of Law No. 26,331 on Minimum Budgets for the Environmental Protection of Native Forests will be strengthened, the deforestation rate will be substantially reduced, and planning projects on a landscape scale will be increased through Forest Watershed Plans and Plans. Integrales Comunitarios (PIC), the National Forest Management Plan with Integrated Livestock (MBGI) will be implemented,</p>
<p>The area of ​​forest plantations will be increased by 2030 through the expansion of the current promotion regimes.</p>
<p>Thus, there will be an integrated forestry sector, endowed with adequate industrial development that contributes to the growth of regional economies, ensuring the sustainability of the resources involved and contributing to the mitigation of climate change based on its potential as a carbon sink.</p>
<p>In terms of risk management, by 2030 the development of fire, flood and drought prevention measures will be deepened, which is particularly important for the agricultural, livestock and forestry sectors. At the same time, progress will be made in the implementation of specific measures and actions for these sectors with the aim of incorporating the current and future impacts of climate change in planning, including risk transfer.</p>
<p>Regarding cooperation and marine scientific research activities, the Argentine Republic will generate valuable information to address climate change and the oceans. The work and scientific conclusions will serve as the basis for the planning and implementation of public policies that can address the particularities of the impacts of climate change on</p>
<p>Argentine maritime spaces and coastal areas. As part of these efforts, the Pampa Azul initiative - a project articulated between various ministries and national organizations - will generate scientific knowledge that will serve as an input for the preservation and sustainable management of marine resources and ecosystems. Likewise, it will promote the generation of technological innovations that contribute to the strengthening of the industries linked to the sea and the economic development of the Argentine maritime regions, as well as a greater awareness in society about the national maritime heritage and the responsible use of its resources. .</p>
<p>Finally, by 2030, the fishing activity will be strengthened in a sustainable way, contributing to food security from an approach that ensures the adaptation of the sector to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure, Territorial Development and Habitat</h3>
<p>An integral environmental planning of the territory will be promoted, which includes sustainable and resilient infrastructures, city-regions and habitat. In this sense, and in line with the decisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity, adaptation actions based on ecosystems will be implemented, promoting their preservation, in particular of native forests, wetlands, peatlands, natural grasslands and other ecosystems with significant carbon contents <a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>43</sup></a>
. At the same time, community-based approaches will be adopted, guaranteeing the care of the most vulnerable population, exposed to climatic risks.</p>
<p>The consolidation of compact and biodiverse cities will be promoted, with a prevalence of use of public transport, which tends to a harmonious coexistence with nature and integrates hydrological systems and natural cycles, maintaining the offer of environmental services they offer.</p>
<p>All levels of sub-national agencies will have territorial and environmental planning instruments that prioritize the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and, in particular, the efficient use of the soil.</p>
<h3>Waste</h3>
<p>By 2030, and with the aim of guaranteeing the minimization of waste generation, improvements in sustainable consumption and production will be adopted, the circular economy will be promoted as one of the available tools, among others, to achieve sustainable development. , the proper management of waste -including separation at source and the promotion of the recycling industry- and the implementation of innovative practices and technologies for the correct treatment of waste. Additionally, management and recovery programs for Universal Generation Special Waste and Industrial Waste will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Science and Technology</h3>
<p>Science, technology and innovation will be fundamental to achieve this vision by 2030. Therefore, a permanent and growing support to the scientific-technological system will have its correlate in the increase of disciplinary and transdisciplinary knowledge, as well as in the support of researchers dedicated to Disruptive innovation projects that will contribute to the development of more and better mitigation and adaptation actions to climate change. The strengthening of the national scientific technological system will allow the Argentine Republic to have new information and measurement systems by 2030, and with models and projections that will reinforce existing capacities with a focus on generating improvements in the mapping of climate vulnerabilities and risks,</p>
<h3>Comprehensive risk management</h3>
<p>By 2030, the integration of Early Warning Systems (EWS) will inform about the impact that meteorological phenomena may cause in the context of climate change. Thus, response actions will be designed and deployed across all sectors, achieving effective territorialization through agreements and interjurisdictional work between the national State, provincial governments and local governments. Regional Platforms will be created that will allow addressing extreme events taking into account the particularities of each region, and the integrated use of available technologies will be promoted, both for the digitally active population and for those that lack the possibility of accessing internet services. in order to achieve greater dissemination and effectiveness of comprehensive risk management. Lastly, the strengthening of the National System for Early Warning and Emergency Monitoring (SINAME) will increase the probability and effectiveness of decision-making mechanisms.</p>



<h3>Health</h3>
<p>In terms of health policies, by 2030 policies, measures and actions will have been implemented to ensure universal coverage and access that provides a timely response to the new epidemiological profiles emerging from environmental and climatic changes, while ensuring operational effectiveness. of the health system during emergencies and disasters related to climate hazards. The Early Warning Systems will have been strengthened for events that produce impacts on health, and climate-sensitive diseases that expand their geographic frontier will be addressed. Additionally, greenhouse gas emissions generated by health care establishments will have been reduced. <a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>
</p>
<h3>Just Work and Transition</h3>
<p>In all the response measures proposed for the implementation of this Second NDC, the Argentine Republic will consider the economic and social consequences thereof, in such a way as to guarantee a just transition. It is considered important to address the specific needs and concerns of developing countries derived from the economic and social impact of the application of response measures, in line with Article 4.8 of the UNFCCC and Article 4.15 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The consequences of climate change have and will have diverse impacts on different aspects of work and employment. The health of the worker will be one of the most affected aspects, especially with regard to professions developed outdoors. Then, the emergence of new occupational diseases, added to existing ones, will constitute a challenge for safety and health at work.</p>
<p>In this regard, by 2030, the environmental dimension will be incorporated into collective bargaining, regulations and compliance with worker protection protocols and various employment programs, promoting the creation of new sustainable jobs. and worthy. Likewise, special attention will be paid to the effects on populations in vulnerable situations, such as women and diversities, youth, indigenous peoples and people with disabilities, considering that these groups have limited participation in decision-making and access to resources, and that are overrepresented in the informal economy and unemployment. Thus, it will be guaranteed that workers have better access to resources (credits, technologies, adequate supplies and training, among others) which will allow them to adapt their activities to climate change. To this end, capacity building will be promoted so that workers can sustain their jobs and grow in them when their jobs are transformed by more sustainable production methods.</p>
<h3>Gender</h3>
<p>By 2030, policies will have been developed in such a way that gender is not a reason for social, political and economic inequality. In this regard, the physical, political and economic autonomy of women and LGBTI + women, their sovereignty over their bodies, lives and territories, and their ability to make decisions will have been strengthened. Policies will be implemented so that women and LGBTI + have social and environmental conditions of habitability of the territories.</p>
<p>To this end, an active participation of women and diversities in consultation and decision-making processes in all aspects of climate policy is considered fundamental - and will be promoted. The voice and representation of women and LGBTI + over the territories they inhabit will be strengthened through access to material, educational, informational, training, financial and technological resources; and the construction of strategic alliances that strengthen their role as agents of change in the processes of adaptation and mitigation to climate change will be promoted.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the process of recognizing the social and environmental importance of care work, it is considered that the sustainability of development must necessarily go through a fairer reorganization, redistribution and social revaluation of care work.</p>



<h3>Education and culture</h3>
<p>By 2030, educational and cultural policies in their environmental dimension will be strengthened and enhanced, creating spaces for the exchange of intergenerational knowledge, promoting youth empowerment and gender equality in politics, and contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. (ODS) and the national and international normative instruments related to the topic <a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>Therefore, and to promote the paradigm shift necessary to respond to the emergency, actions aimed at climate empowerment will be promoted (Articles 6 of the UNFCCC and 12 of the Paris Agreement), as well as educational and cultural policies that transversally promote climate change. environmental and climate awareness, public participation of youth organizations and different local actors, teacher training in environmental education for climate change, training and technical assistance for projects that allow communities and citizens to access and acquire knowledge of environmental issues and of climate change.</p>
<p>The process of institutionalization of environmental education and culture as public policy will promote the consolidation of comprehensive regulatory frameworks, the incorporation of the environmental and climate dimension into educational and cultural policies, the training of technical management teams and policy design. educational and cultural programs, the strengthening of innovation projects and lines of research, the systematization and strengthening of existing pedagogical experiences, the carrying out of specific studies on the impacts of climate change on access to the right to education, the perception of climate change in the educational community, and the targeting of cultural policies and programs for populations in vulnerable situations, such as girls and boys, adults, older adults, and people with disabilities.</p>
<h3>External relationships</h3>
<p>International trade contributes to development and job creation, so the adoption of barriers to international trade with climate change objectives should be avoided.</p>
<p>Argentina supports and promotes an open international economic system that leads to economic growth and sustainable development in all countries, as well as that the measures adopted to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, do not constitute a means of discrimination. arbitrary or unjustifiable or a disguised restriction on international trade, in accordance with the UNFCCC (Article 3.5). This becomes even more relevant in the context of the unprecedented economic, social and health crisis caused by COVID-19, in which trade plays a fundamental role in contributing to an inclusive and sustainable post-pandemic economic recovery.</p>
<p>Argentina is convinced that the response to contain, mitigate and overcome the pandemic and its consequences should contemplate an increase in international cooperation through multidimensional, coordinated, innovative and effective actions that include multiactor alliances, and that are directed, on everything, to the most vulnerable sectors.</p>
<p>For this, it will be necessary to debate the architecture of international cooperation, as well as to favor the design of new cooperation schemes within the framework of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, particularly in relation to goal 17, which invites us to revitalize alliances to achieve objectives and their associated goals. In this sense, in terms of international cooperation, Argentina proposes progress towards a balanced and mutually beneficial relationship with traditional partners, while retaking a constructive agenda for Latin America and the Caribbean, capable of contributing to a joint approach of the development gaps each country faces.</p>
<p>With this horizon, Argentina will deepen South-South and triangular cooperation actions, promote the expansion of multi-stakeholder alliances, promote joint action with the private sector, international organizations and agencies, and put into operation mechanisms to attract sources of financing. innovative, in order to join forces to accelerate progress.</p>


<h2>4. Guiding axes</h2>


<p>This new climate commitment assumed by the country must accompany the poverty eradication processes, fostering a just transition towards integral and sustainable development that ensures that no one is left behind, and that addresses the needs of the entire current population without affecting the well-being of future generations.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is essential to consider the adverse effects that climate change has on biological diversity and natural resources, as well as the potential effects on human health that it could entail. Additionally, a comprehensive climate action will only be possible if it contemplates human rights, from an intercultural perspective with a gender and diversity perspective, considering the differential impacts of climate change on children, youth, the elderly, people with disabilities, the population. Afro-descendant, migrants, refugees, rural population, workers, indigenous and peasant communities, and other vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>For this reason, and for the purposes of a systematization under which the transversality of each of the concepts underlies, fifteen guiding axes have been defined that, complementing the principles established in the current legal framework, will guide the design, implementation and monitoring of all national mitigation and adaptation actions to comply with this Second NDC.</p>

<p><img src="ARG-NDC2_2.png" style="width:5.51875in;height:2.23333in"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Guiding axes.</p>
<h3>United Nations 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
<p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs will serve as a guide for the planning and implementation of actions against climate change that arise from the fulfillment of this Second NDC. The design and implementation of these actions will be carried out considering and analyzing in a systemic way their consequences on each one of the dimensions of sustainable development: social, economic and environmental. Likewise, the institutional implications will be taken into account.</p>
<h3>Federalization</h3>
<p>The cross-cutting nature of climate policy requires joint and coordinated work between the different instances of the national, provincial and local government in order to provide adequate responses to the climate emergency, and at the same time representative of the various socio-environmental realities, expectations , local needs and opportunities.</p>
<p>Thinking about climate policy in a federal way generates the necessary impulse to mainstream the approach to climate change in the territorial sectoral structures. Under this premise, provincial and local institutions become essential in identifying the sectors in vulnerable situations and the measures that can generate the greatest impact, as well as promoting greater citizen involvement.</p>
<p>Thus, the commitment assumed by subnational governments through the joint definition of Argentine climate policy will allow the identification of additional or complementary actions that maximize the probability of achieving the established objectives. For this reason, the national and provincial authorities will work in an articulated manner to strengthen the capacities and specific competencies of local governments in planning sustainable urban and territorial development, through tools such as technical advice, capacity building and support for innovation.</p>
<p>Likewise, the work of federalizing climate policies will be carried out taking into account territorial equity, in order to incorporate the diversity of realities and capacities present in the different territories and balance historical inequalities.</p>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>The magnitude of the challenges assumed requires the commitment of the various sectors and actors of society, within a framework of planning, participatory and transparent management. In order for the right to public participation to be exercised responsibly, it is essential to promote environmental education for the population, both formally and through the media. It is also essential to have a multiplicity of voices for the construction of a socio-economic-environmental perspective, in which the different knowledge, learning, knowledge, values ​​and environmental practices converge in a regional and local awareness of the problems , allowing the promotion of action-oriented public participation.</p>
<h3>Human rights</h3>
<p>The right to a healthy environment is an autonomous right with individual and collective connotations that is recognized in various international human rights instruments. Likewise, it is closely linked to other fundamental rights, and its protection is a guarantee for the exercise of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as civil and political rights. Therefore, it is incorporated as the backbone of climate planning in the short, medium and long term, taking into account the interdependence, comprehensiveness and transversality of all rights.</p>
<h3>Just transition</h3>
<p>The just transition is a roadmap that guides the actions of States, social actors and international organizations to transform societies and economies towards sustainable development, centered on people and with solidarity and inclusive policies that ensure the social justice for all. The just transition involves the adaptation of productive systems and their impacts on the world of work, both formal and informal, as well as the changes in people's lives produced as a result of these. It includes the importance of social dialogue and tripartite work between the government, employers' organizations and unions, as well as social organizations, setting common objectives. This axis also incorporates the relevance of decent work and sustainable jobs, the need for training and acquisition of skills for new jobs, as well as the contribution of the circular, social and popular economy as one of the tools available, among others, to achieve sustainable development. This perspective also implies the commitment to achieve development that includes the protection of groups and territories in situations of greater vulnerability, and the health of workers.</p>
<h3>Equity</h3>
<p>Climate change does not affect everyone equally, since certain actors and sectors are at a disadvantage because they do not have the resources, skills and instruments to be able to face the negative impacts. In this sense, the commitment of the Argentine Republic to contribute to the protection of the climate system on the basis of equity is reiterated, understanding that the response to climate change must also be the opportunity to improve people's living conditions. In particular, of those who are at a disadvantage. Also noteworthy in this instance is the intergenerational equity approach that imposes the need to guarantee the conservation of natural resources and the environment for their access and enjoyment by present and future generations.</p>
<h3>Gender</h3>
<p>The Argentine Republic will mainstream the gender and diversity perspective in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. In this sense, active and effective intervention is required in its design and implementation to reduce inequality gaps based on gender in its different dimensions. This places people in a central position as subjects of law, under the principles of equality, non-violence and non-discrimination, while promoting autonomy and participation in decision-making by women and LGBTI + groups, through the deconstruction of gender-based power mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Interculturality</h3>
<p>The Argentine Republic considers it essential to incorporate the principle of interculturality in its climate policy in order to respect the country's cultural, ethnic, religious and language diversity. This principle implies the recognition and integration of local knowledge, ancestral knowledge and practices, cultural values ​​and guidelines, systems, habits and communities in climate actions, taking into account and respecting current laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>Health</h3>
<p>Health is the mainstay of the general well-being of the population, and is directly linked to the quality of life of citizens. This Second NDC highlights the importance of mainstreaming health as a work axis, particularly in the current context of pandemic, and in the medium and long term, being aware of the impact of climate change on health, through heat waves and cold weather, disasters related to climatic threats and the spread of disease-transmitting vectors. Therefore, the actions will focus on community health as an instrument for linking with populations in vulnerable situations in order to sensitize, prevent and promote collective health care.</p>
<h3>Community-based adaptation</h3>
<p>The Argentine Republic emphasizes the importance of using the Community-based Adaptation (CBA) approach, since they are the protagonists in the processes to reduce their vulnerability, reduce GHG emissions and increase their capacity to face the impacts and risks of change. climate. In addition, these processes of planning actions in the short, medium and long term against climate change, when led by the communities themselves, recognize their priorities, needs, knowledge and capacities, and lead to their community empowerment.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive risk management</h3>
<p>Climate change is considered one of the key factors that contribute to the increase in disaster risk, adding additional pressure to environmental degradation and urban growth, especially unplanned growth.</p>
<p>It is therefore essential to work on the identification, forecasting and prevention of risks and threats derived from climate change, strengthening local response capacities and the organized participation of communities in building resilience.</p>
<h3>Innovation, science and technology</h3>
<p>The promotion of active policies in science, technology and innovation, in the context of climate change, is essential to adopt adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies. In this sense, the scientific-technological system plays a fundamental role in the generation of knowledge and methodologies that serve as the basis for the elaboration of sectoral plans at the municipal, provincial and national levels. The incorporation of innovation as a transversal axis to climate policy will be the basis to deepen and accelerate through projects, disruptive actions and the development and transfer of technologies, the achievement of the global objectives of climate action.</p>
<h3>Environmental education</h3>
<p>The Argentine Republic conceives environmental education in an integral and transversal way, as a critical social practice, whose purpose is to promote environmental and climate literacy, in pursuit of the formation of an environmentally sensitive and responsible citizenship in the exercise and defense of the right to a healthy and diverse environment that ensures sustainable development. In this sense, environmental education and the promotion of a culture with a climate perspective are aligned with the principles of intergenerational equity, human rights, interculturality and gender equality.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem-based adaptation</h3>
<p>The country recognizes the importance of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and promotes its inclusion as a fundamental support for the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems, especially native forests, wetlands, peatlands, natural grasslands and others. ecosystems with significant carbon contents, contributing to the absorption and storage capacity of carbon, reducing vulnerability, and increasing the resilience of ecosystems and the communities that inhabit and depend on them.</p>
<h3>Energy security</h3>
<p>Energy security is one of the main axes that will guide the energy transition of the Argentine Republic in the medium and long term. An inclusive, dynamic, stable, federal, sovereign and sustainable energy matrix must guarantee the availability of energy to users and the reliability of the system. Likewise, to achieve energy security it will be essential to migrate towards schemes that promote the rational use of energy, innovation, development, transfer and the incorporation of new technologies appropriate to the national context.</p>
<h3>Food safety</h3>
<p>Food security is recognized as a fundamental priority in the Paris Agreement, which states that its objective will be achieved "in a way that does not compromise food production." In the Argentine Republic, climate actions related to the agricultural sector are designed and implemented taking into account the key role that agriculture plays in national development and, in particular, recognizing the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security, contributing to the reduction poverty, hunger and the vulnerability of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.</p>
<h3>Transparency, accuracy, comparability, consistency and completeness</h3>
<p>Climate policy instruments must be based on scientific evidence, and on robust data and transparency. Therefore, it is essential to assume as guiding principles the principles established in Decision 18 / CMA.1: Transparency, Accuracy, Comparability, Consistency and Completeness, which will be taken as a guide for the implementation and continuous improvement of the National Information System on Climate Change, established by the Climate Change Law.</p>

<h2 id="meta">5. Meta</h2>
<p>The Argentine Republic will not exceed the <strong>net emission of 359 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in the year 2030</strong> , applicable to all sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>By 2030, Argentines will have knowledge about the adverse effects of climate change, the corresponding adaptation measures and will have built capacities that allow them to respond in solidarity to the urgent challenge of protecting the planet.</p>
<p>The climate policy of the Argentine Republic will have managed to increase the adaptation capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce the vulnerability of the different social, economic and environmental sectors, through measures that will prioritize communities and social groups in vulnerable situations and will incorporate the gender approach and intergenerational equity.</p>
<p>All this will be with a view to contributing to sustainable development, building a more equitable, just and caring society and achieving an adequate response to climate change compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.</p>


<p>The contribution of the Argentine Republic to global efforts is based on the best available science and is in turn ambitious and equitable. However, it is relevant to note that both the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement establish that developed country Parties should take the initiative in combating climate change and its adverse effects through the provision and mobilization of new and additional financial resources, including resources for technology transfer.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Argentine Republic reaffirms the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities, as referenced in Principle 7 of the 1992 Rio Declaration, Articles 3 and 4 of the UNFCCC and the preamble of the Paris Agreement. . Principle that, in turn, the National Climate Change Law retakes and reaffirms.</p>
<p>In this sense, the policies and actions required to achieve the goal of this contribution will be implemented without prejudice to the use of the financial mechanisms provided by the Convention. And although the implementation of this Second NDC is not contingent on international support, Argentina understands that the support that developed countries can provide to fulfill their national ambition will generate significant global benefits.</p>
<h3>Market Mechanisms</h3>
<p>The Argentine Republic reserves its national position and decision-making in relation to the possible use of any market mechanism, referred to in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and that may be established in the future, until the negotiations on the aforementioned article reach a conclusion under the UNFCCC. Meanwhile, in the event of the existence and operation of these market approaches, the following national criteria have been established for their use, based on national circumstances and interests:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Argentine Republic recognizes that there is an intrinsic value in natural resources and ecosystem services that cannot be captured solely through market mechanisms.</li>
<li>Any cooperation mechanism established within the framework of the UNFCCC, whether market-based or not, must be transparent, contribute to ensuring environmental integrity, avoid double counting, and increase global ambition in terms of reducing GHG emissions, as well as being in line with the SDGs.</li>
<li>The aforementioned market mechanisms should not deepen the current inequity in the distribution of efforts in the face of climate change. To this end, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities of the Parties should be borne in mind, as well as additional factors such as geographic location and differentiated impacts of climate change, trade profile, degree of economic development. and social, the contribution to global food security, and the urgency of adaptation.</li>

<li>
The aforementioned market mechanisms and operations must contribute to the capacity of developing countries, including the Argentine Republic, to honor the climate commitments to which it has arrived in a nationally determined manner, and in no case should they constitute disguised mechanisms of trade protectionism or unilateral impositions.</li>


<li>The aforementioned market mechanisms must guarantee full respect for national and provincial legislation, as well as be in harmony with the approaches and safeguards corresponding to REDD +, and others defined within the framework of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long Term Strategy</h3>
<p>The goals presented in this Second NDC reflect the will of the Argentine Republic to contribute to sustainable development and are part of a long-term analysis. Its fulfillment thus becomes a milestone on the path of the just transition towards a resilient, sustainable, inclusive and innovative Argentina where none of its citizens is left behind. Along these lines, the country will present its long-term low-emission development strategy at the next Conference of the Parties to be held in Glasgow in 2021, with the aim of achieving carbon-neutral development by 2050.</p>
<p>This objective will require long-term structural changes and a gradual action plan in the short term. Climate action promotes efficiency and innovation, which is why it also means an opportunity for a productive structural change whose objective is to achieve economic reactivation, the generation of jobs and the improvement of the economic competitiveness of national production, in a just transition framework.</p>

<h2 id="mitigación">6. Mitigation</h2>
<h3 id="contexto-de-la-mitigación-en-la-república-argentina">6.1 Context of mitigation in the Argentine Republic</h3>

<p>In 2017, the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory System of Argentina (SNI-GEI-AR) was created, which structures and orders institutional relations, defining roles and responsibilities for the calculation and reporting of the National Greenhouse Inventory Greenhouse (INGEI).</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, the Argentine Republic presented its last Biennial Update Report (IBA 3) before the UNFCCC, in which the total net emissions for the year 2016 were estimated at 364.44 MtCO2e. Additionally, the IBA 3 includes the time series for the period 1990-2016 and was calculated under a systematized scheme in terms of data acquisition, information processing, and calculation and reporting methods, which represented a qualitative leap in the mode of elaboration of the INGEI. Additionally, IBA 3 was the first to include as a general annex a National Inventory Report (INI) as an extended INGEI report that explains with a greater level of detail all aspects related to its preparation. IBA 3 also included the REDD + Technical Annex <a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a>
, which describes the results achieved by the Argentine Republic in reducing emissions from deforestation for the 2014-2016 period.</p>
<p>As can be seen in figure 4, the IBA 3 shows that, between 1990 and 2016, the country's net emissions showed an increasing trend until 2007 and a decreasing trend in recent years, with an absolute peak in emissions in 2007 and a secondary peak in 2013. From the sectoral analysis it can be inferred that the evolution of the Energy, PIUP and Waste sectors responded to a greater extent to the economic and / or population conditions, reflecting a growing trend for the period considered. For its part, the AGSOUT sector showed fluctuations associated both with foreign trade variables, as well as with sector policies and weather conditions, so it did not present constant trends. Likewise, this sector has reflected changes in the deforestation patterns of native forests. The IBA 3 shows that between</p>

<p>Within the framework of the GNCC, the work of projection of emissions and removals was coordinated by the Secretariat of Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Innovation and carried out in conjunction with the technical teams of the enforcement agencies, who contributed the modeling of the explanatory variables. These are key variables that account for the greatest changes in the level of GHG emissions in the different sectors of the country. These include population, gross domestic product, energy supply and demand, cattle stocks, agricultural production, and land use change.</p>
<p>The projection of emissions and removals for 2030 was carried out using a simplified model consistent with the methodology and sources of emissions and removals estimated in the INGEI 2016 reported in IBA 3 in December 2019. In the INI of IBA 3, reported in March of 2020, you will find the detail of the methodology and the emission factors used in the modeling. To obtain the projections, various technical workshops were held to increase the ambition of the trajectories and maintain coherence and consistency between the different sectors. Each sector of the INGEI was modeled separately, and then the results were integrated and aggregated by the technical team of the National Directorate of Climate Change. In the case of variables related to the energy sector, The same energy demand and supply models used for national energy planning were used. e contemplated a growing demand for consumption by the population with energy efficiency measures in all sectors, a significant increase in the percentage of renewable energy and distributed generation, and a higher production of natural gas in absolute and relative terms with respect to the oil production. In the transportation subsector, active policies aimed at increasing efficiency and the use of natural gas and electricity were taken into account. In turn, cutting with biofuels was included. e contemplated a growing demand for consumption by the population with energy efficiency measures in all sectors, a significant increase in the percentage of renewable energy and distributed generation, and a higher production of natural gas in absolute and relative terms with respect to the oil production.

<p>For the PIUP sector, a slight increase in emissions is expected, given the growth of GDP, and compliance with the Kigali amendment for hydrofluorocarbon gases was contemplated. Regarding waste, a growth is projected in the percentage of urban solid waste disposed of in sanitary landfills as well as in the capture of the methane they originate. These measures would allow the sector's emissions to be kept practically constant.</p>
<p>In the livestock subsector, a slight increase in emissions was observed, mainly due to higher bovine, poultry and pig production. In the case of bovine livestock, an increase in production efficiency was contemplated. For agriculture, an increase in emissions is also expected due to increased production as a result of the use of fertilizers and improved crop yields.</p>
<p>The decrease in emissions from the Forestry and Other Land Uses subsector stem from a strong boost to forest plantations, and a drastic reduction in deforestation.
</p><p>For all sectors, a unified economic growth percentage was used that is consistent with the country's recovery and a sustained increase in population.

<h2 id="comunicación-de-adaptación">7. Adaptive communication</h2>

<p>This section should be considered as the Second Adaptation Communication of the Argentine Republic, in accordance with articles 7.10 and 7.11 of the Paris Agreement and Decision 9 / CMA.1. Both frameworks guide the preparation and content of the Adaptation Communication.</p>
<p>The Argentine Republic is a developing country particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, at the same time that it has made early progress in identifying and planning adaptation measures. It hereby sets out a National Adaptation Goal, which contributes to the Global Adaptation Goal of article 7 of the Paris Agreement in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.</p>
<p>In line with the objective outlined, 35 priority adaptation measures are identified in seven sectors of the country to address the different territorial, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities to climate change. In turn, the measures consider the gender and diversity perspective and contribute to other international normative frameworks, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Convention for Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Sendai Framework. and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. It should be noted that several of the prioritized measures could have mitigation co-benefits.</p>
<p>The present Adaptation Communication aims to inform and highlight the progress and results already obtained in the area of ​​adaptation in the country, as well as the adaptation efforts of the Argentine Republic so that they are recognized in the Global Balance. Likewise, it identifies barriers, financial support needs -particularly donations for adaptation-, technology transfer and capacity building in order to advance in the implementation of prioritized measures, and includes a clear reference to the National Adaptation Plan, which develops the objectives and proposed measures, as well as monitoring and evaluation actions.</p>
<p>Lastly, and for the purpose of facilitating the understanding of this document in accordance with the provisions of Decision 9 / CMA.1, an indicative table of the contents that refer to the elements of the annex to said Decision is presented.</p>

<h3>7.1 Context of adaptation in the Argentine Republic</h3>
<h4>7.1.1 National circumstances, institutional arrangements and legal frameworks</h4>


<p>See section 2.2 Legal framework and 2.3 NDC governance scheme.</p>

<h3>7.1.2. Vulnerabilities of Argentina regarding the adverse effects of climate change.</h3>

<p>The Argentine Republic is a developing country particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change under Article 7, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, and under Article 4, paragraph 8, of the UNFCCC, since it has: zones low coastal; arid and semi-arid zones; areas with forest cover and areas exposed to forest deterioration; disaster prone areas; areas exposed to drought and desertification; and areas of fragile ecosystems, including mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>In most of the non-Patagonian Argentine Republic, during the period 1960-2010 an increase in mean temperature of around 0.5 ° C was observed, with maximums greater than 1 ° C in various areas of Patagonia. Changes were also observed in the east and north of the country with respect to the frequency of extreme temperatures, fewer frosts and a higher frequency of heat waves. In turn, the number of days per year with heat waves doubled between 1960 and 2010, and a considerable increase was observed with respect to the number of days with heat waves, particularly in the regions close to the city of Buenos Aires. Regarding the temperature projections, towards the end of the century they foresee an increase in the entire national territory, highlighting the case of northwestern Argentina,</p>
<p>On the other hand, based on the information reflected in the PNAyM of 2019 for the period 1960-2010, increases in the average annual rainfall were observed for most of the Argentine territory, with interannual and interdecadal variations. The largest nominal increases were registered in specific areas of the east of the country, with more than 200 mm / year, however, which percentage increases were more significant in semi-arid areas.</p>
<p>This change brought important consequences in the water balance and hydrology of the region. Thus, in the east and center of the province of Buenos Aires, south of Santa Fe and south of Corrientes, numerous fields have been transformed into permanent lagoons and water bodies, such as the Mar Chiquita lagoons in Córdoba and the Picasa lagoons in Santa Fe, which considerably increased its surface.</p>
<p>On the contrary, over the Patagonian Andes, a negative variation was observed in the mean annual precipitation for the period 1960–2010. In the particular case of Cuyo, the trends in the flows of some rivers in the north of Mendoza and in San Juan throughout the 20th century seem to indicate lower rainfall in their upper basins on the Cordillera. If this trend continues, the availability of necessary water would be affected, for example, as a source of irrigation in viticulture and fruit and vegetable activity.</p>
<p>In the period 1960-2010 there was an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall in much of the country, registering higher values ​​in some areas, one of them being the humid littoral region. This resulted in more frequent floods, also influenced by inappropriate land use and occupation, resulting in areas with high exposure and vulnerability, and water works exposed to different climatic conditions than those for which they were planned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the west and most notably in the north, the dry winter periods have become longer. In these regions, there is little or no rainfall in winter and therefore the increase in the maximum number of consecutive dry days indicates a shift towards an extension of the dry winter period. This has generated problems in the availability of water for some populations and for livestock activities, creating more favorable conditions for fires in grasslands and forests.</p>
<p>In addition, the strong interannual and interdecadal variability of rainfall is largely explained by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena, since in the region where Argentina is located it causes precipitation above the average. medium, and La Niña, which generates dry periods.</p>
<p>For the scenario of higher concentrations (RCP8.5), a decrease of between 10 and 20% in the mean annual precipitation over western Patagonia and in the mountain range of Mendoza is projected by the end of the century, and an increase in the same characteristics in the center and most of the east of the country. Also in line with recent observations, increases in the frequency of heavy rainfall events are projected.</p>
<p>In addition to the present and future climatic conditions previously indicated, various vulnerabilities and adverse impacts associated with the climate already identified and / or expected for the different regions of Argentina are listed below, according to the differentiation made based on the Third Communication National (TCN) submitted by the country:</p>

<p><strong>Table 1.</strong> Vulnerabilities and adverse impacts associated with climate change in the different regions of the Argentine Republic (PNAyM, 2019) and based on the survey carried out together with COFEMA.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that the conditioning factors based on gender, social dimension, ethnicity, age and religion, among others, influence the construction and determination of vulnerabilities and capacities, generating differences and inequalities when facing and recovering facing the impacts of climate change <a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>
. Along the same lines, the higher rate of job insecurity and unemployment, income inequality as well as participation in lower productivity jobs, place women in a situation of greater vulnerability to face the disasters caused by change climate <a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>In recent years, Argentina experienced an increase in the femininity index of poor households, which implies that they concentrate a higher proportion of women. In this sense, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that by 2013 women dedicated an average of 15.2 hours per week to paid work, compared to 33.2 hours per week for men, and a average of 42.4 hours of unpaid work compared to 17.3 hours for men <a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a>
. In this framework, and deepening the analysis from a gender perspective, informal settlements represent urban areas where women are in a greater state of vulnerability as a consequence of the lack of provision of public services, deficiencies in housing and habitat. and high probabilities of suffering situations of violence, which are exacerbated in crisis scenarios. In the case of rural women, and given their simultaneous role of performing reproductive and productive tasks, they face greater barriers to the development and commercialization of products and little experience in the management and use of credit. In addition, they have restrictions on land tenure and face a lack of potable water <a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a>

.</p>



<p>On the other hand, from a cross-border approach, vulnerabilities associated with shared resources are identified, which are presented as an opportunity for cooperation in adaptation management. In this sense, in the Cuenca del Plata <a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>
, the hydroclimatic scenarios for the end of the century of the main water courses foresee decreases in summer rainfall in Upper Paraguay with impacts on access to water, agricultural productivity, energy generation and ecosystems; increases in precipitation -depending on the time of year- in Lower Paraguay, Upper Paraná, Lower Paraná, Lower Uruguay and Río de la Plata; and year-round increases in rainfall in Upper Uruguay, with impacts associated with increased frequency and intensity of riverine flooding and coastal erosion.</p>
<p>Similar analyzes were carried out in the area of ​​the Andes Mountains, where an increase in the risk of loss of thickness and surface of permanent snow-covered areas is expected, with very relevant effects on the hydrological regime of the mountain range, and with effects on the access to water, in tourism and in other productive activities, including fruit, vegetables and wine.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the previously identified vulnerabilities, <a href="#_bookmark13">Figure 5</a> presents a map that reflects the main vulnerabilities of the Argentine Republic, taking as a source those already synthesized, especially in the PNAyM preparation process, as well as those that arise of the Convention:</p>

<h3>7.2 Ex ante adaptation cycle</h3>

<h4>7.2.1 National objective for adaptation</h4>


<p>In order to have a general strategic framework for the development of adaptation measures, the following National Adaptation Objective is established:</p>
<p>By 2030, Argentines will have knowledge about the adverse effects of climate change, the corresponding adaptation measures, and will have built capacities that allow them to respond in solidarity to the urgent challenge of protecting the planet.</p>
<p>The climate policy of the Argentine Republic will have managed to increase the capacity for adaptation, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability in the different local governments and social, economic and environmental sectors, through measures that, among others, will prioritize the communities. and social groups in situations of vulnerability and will incorporate the gender approach and intergenerational equity. This process will be based on the best available scientific knowledge and could generate mitigation co-benefits, as the case may be.</p>
<p>All this will be with a view to contributing to sustainable development, building a more equitable, just and caring society and achieving an adequate response to climate change compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.</p>

<h4>7.2.2 Cross-cutting approaches that guide adaptation</h4>

<p>The following cross-cutting approaches will be taken into account: gender and diversity, ecosystem-based adaptation, community-based adaptation and comprehensive disaster risk management <a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a>
.</p>

<h4>7.2.3 National adaptation measures</h4>

<p>Below is a list of the main adaptation measures to be implemented in order to fulfill the National Objective previously described.</p>
<p>The measures contain a comprehensive statement and the main vulnerabilities identified (Section 7.1.2) are identified to which each one is directed. Each measure describes, if applicable, its general benefits or those secondary in terms of mitigation (co-benefits), and which international frameworks and conventions it contributes, these being the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in the framework of the 2030 Agenda; the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD); the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030; and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. Additionally, it describes its relationship with the provisions of the Climate Change Law.</p>
<p>The measures also contain an analysis from the gender perspective, where for each measure classification criteria are established according to their impact on reducing inequality. In this sense, it is considered pertinent to monitor all the policies implemented from this perspective, in order to identify impact opportunities on reducing inequality gaps due to gender, as well as to alert and correct possible negative impacts. The categorization based on the decreasing degree of impact is listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>They do not report impacts related to gender: measures in which, a priori, the gender approach is not considered applicable and / or they do not specify or analyze its impact on social relations.</li>
<li>With potential impact differentiated by gender: measures that identify and recognize existing gender inequalities, but their objectives do not set out to transform and / or address these inequalities. These measures may include gender-disaggregated data and some mention of gender equality. They are measures that have the potential to intervene with positive actions to reduce gaps, but which, by action or omission, the guidelines in this regard are not specified.</li>
<li>Transforming gender gaps: measures that seek to overcome inequalities based on gender for the effective promotion of gender equality. Gender-transformative policies identify, understand and implement actions to reduce gender gaps and overcome historical gender biases in policies and interventions; as well as contributing to the active promotion of gender equality. These measures can include gender analyzes that demonstrate existing gender gaps, as well as the causes and factors that create them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tables 2 to 36.</strong> Cross-cutting adaptation measures and priority sectors.</p>

<h4 id="el-plan-nacional-de-adaptación-pna">7.2.4 The National Adaptation Plan (PNA)</h4>

<p>The Argentine Republic is in the process of formulating its NAP, in accordance with the Cancun Adaptation Framework adopted by Decision 1 / CP.16 at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the Convention, and under Paragraph 9 of Article 7 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The PNA is also part of the provisions of article 16 of the Climate Change Law, which establishes the obligation of the Executive Power to prepare the “National Plan for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change”, and is related to the provisions of article 20 of the same law that establishes the formulation of Response Plans to climate change to be developed by the jurisdictions that make up the national territory.</p>
<p>The NAP will establish strategic lines that function as a framework for the various adaptation planning processes, both at the sectoral and subnational levels, facilitating and guiding these initiatives and, at the same time, considering determining factors and climate projections with a view to reducing risk. climate.</p>
<p>The PNA therefore stands as a key instrument for the development of public policy on adaptation in the Argentine Republic, which seeks to promote decentralized and co-constructive processes, through each of its phases. This implies that the NAP draws on subnational and community experiences, while promoting that sectors and communities have at their disposal the necessary tools to advance their own adaptation strategies and plans.</p>

<h4 id="la-cooperación-para-mejorar-la-adaptación-en-los-planos-nacional-regional-e-internacional">7.3.2 Cooperation to improve adaptation at the national, regional and international levels</h4>

<p>In order to adequately implement adaptation, and in a context of incremental climatic threats, it is necessary to strengthen domestic cooperation processes, as well as at the regional and international levels. To strengthen adaptation actions in programming and implementation, the Argentine Republic has developed an active participation in cooperation processes at each and every one of these levels.</p>
<p>At the national level, within the framework of the Climate Change Law, cross-cutting institutional processes have been developed that strengthen inter-institutional and multilevel cooperation, in particular the creation of the GNCC, its Extended Tables and, soon, the Advisory Council. These arrangements have generated a profound change in the work dynamics in the area of ​​adaptation and have become key, both to increase knowledge about vulnerabilities, as well as to implement intersectoral actions and mainstream adaptation measures in planning of activities. various institutions.</p>
<p>At the subnational level, concrete progress has been made within the framework of COFEMA, with the active participation of the provinces. In this sense, it is expected that the sub-national spheres can develop Response Plans as established in the Climate Change Law, which strategically incorporate relevant adaptation actions to face the main territorial vulnerabilities identified.</p>
<p>At the regional and transboundary level, the Argentine Republic has begun - together with the Eastern Republic of Uruguay - the implementation of an adaptation project for vulnerable cities and ecosystems in the Uruguay River, which is financed by the Adaptation Fund. This program will allow the implementation of pilot adaptation actions to reduce incremental vulnerabilities to floods, and improve knowledge and management of river ecosystems.</p>
<p>In the same sense, Argentina has been an active participant in the development of the Strategic Action Plan for the La Plata Basin in terms of adaptation to climate change and variability, which made it possible to prioritize adaptation measures at the basin level together with Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, with support from the Global Environment Facility.</p>
<p>Finally, at the international level, the country has assumed a constructive leadership role in defense and development of the adaptation issue under the terms of the UNFCCC, assuming on numerous occasions the representation of all developing countries in adaptation negotiations. within the framework of the Group of 77 + China, and being an active participant in the ABU negotiating group in the Convention, made up of the Argentine Republic, Brazil and Uruguay, providing technical input in the negotiations related to the implementation of adaptation under the Agreement of Paris, and in the design of the instrument of the Adaptation Communication.</p>
<p>Under the same slogan, experts from Argentina actively participate in the UNFCCC Adaptation Committee, in the Adaptation Fund Board, in the Green Climate Fund Board, in the Council of the Global Environment Facility and in the Executive Committee of Technology of the Convention, contributing to the knowledge in adaptation and to the support to the developing countries in financial and technological matters. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the Argentine Republic, during the rotating Presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) that it held in 2018, managed to include issues related to adaptation, allowing a new geopolitical scope of the same.</p>

<h4 id="las-barreras-a-la-implementación-de-la-adaptación">Barriers to implementation of adaptation</h4>

<p>In IBA 3 presented by the Argentine Republic in 2019, a detailed analysis of the existing barriers to the implementation of adaptation was carried out, regarding financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building for prioritized thematic areas.

<h4>7.3.4 Good practices and lessons learned, and information exchange: mainstreaming the gender perspective in adaptation</h4>

<p>The Argentine Republic has prioritized, among other cross-cutting approaches, the gender perspective in climate action in general, and in adaptation in particular. In this sense, it considers it pertinent to share this approach, as a good practice in the planning and implementation of adaptation.</p>
<p>In this regard, a work plan was developed that aims to mainstream the gender perspective in the PNAyMCC, in the response plans, and in the policies and measures that emerged within the framework of the GNCC. The work plan establishes various stages for its development and implementation. As a first step, during the diagnostic stage, existing gender inequalities are identified in all spheres involved in the aforementioned policies and plans. Later, in the training and awareness stage, the necessary link between gender and climate change and its methodological and institutional instances is developed. Finally, and from the generation of spaces for the exchange of experiences and good practices, specialists in the subject,</p>
<p>In terms of raising awareness, a discussion was held to integrate the gender perspective into the climate change agenda, which included views from government management and science. The discussion was aimed at the general public and had the participation of youth organizations that work to raise awareness and sensitize in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>A training course on "Gender and Climate Change" was also held to integrate this perspective into the PNA. The course was aimed at all the personnel of the National Directorate of Climate Change and its purpose was to introduce the subject from its more general notions to more specific conceptual and methodological issues related to how to mainstream gender issues in adaptation. These courses are considered to be of special importance, since gender relations can be sources of social inequalities, both internally within organizations and in the actions promoted by them.</p>
<p>Based on the results and conclusions of these awareness-raising and training instances, an initial identification of socioeconomic vulnerabilities with a gender perspective was carried out, as well as the categorization of adaptation measures according to their differential impact on genders. . This was a fundamental step forward in reflecting how the gender perspective can become an integral axis of a climate policy.</p>
<p>Also within the framework of capacity building, a course was held on the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system with the aim of applying it to the NAP. In this sense, the medium-term objective is to achieve the implementation of an M&amp;E system that includes gender considerations in the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation policies.</p>
<p>Likewise, ties were strengthened with the Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity, in order to define lines of joint work; and contacts were initiated with technical teams from other countries that allowed the sharing of strategies, methods and instruments for the incorporation of the gender perspective, as well as making visible the obstacles and challenges emerging during the process. These relations actions also made it possible to establish potential work commitments at the regional level to advance on gender issues and climate policies.</p>

<h2>8. Means of implementation</h2>
<h3>8.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>Taking into account the national circumstances and the capacities of the Argentine Republic, and depending on the needs that the country prioritizes, it is essential to have access to the financial, technology development and transfer mechanisms, and capacity building that were created or are being implemented. created by the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Although there is an absolute unconditional goal and a set of specific measures whose implementation will be promoted at the national and subnational level, it is considered essential to have the provision of sufficient means of implementation as established in the Agreement. of Paris in its articles 2.1c, 3, 4.5, 9, 10 and 11, if what is intended is to guarantee an implementation that is cost-effective and that allows facing the existing abatement costs. In this way, the Argentine Republic will achieve inclusive economic growth, sustainable development, and the desirable effectiveness in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>To respond to these challenges, within the framework of the GNCC, the Sustainable Finance Working Group and the International Financing Unit (UFI) were formed. The first one aims to design the enabling framework to align financial flows with the promotion of the 2030 Agenda and climate action in the Argentine Republic, as well as to strengthen the country's position regarding the regulation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. For its part, the UFI will be in charge of evaluating, prioritizing and monitoring the projects that the country presents to climate investment funds and multilateral and bilateral credit organizations.</p>
<p>The Undersecretariat of International Financial Relations for Development, dependent on the Secretariat for Strategic Affairs of the Presidency of the Nation, in conjunction with the GNCC, will develop the Country Strategy with the objective of articulating with the Green Climate Fund and other funds aimed at climate finance. Likewise, it will seek to include financing for projects related to the response to climate change in the annual programming of other multilateral and bilateral credit organizations.</p>
<p>For its part, and with the aim of increasing the transparency and traceability of the State's climate investment, the National Budget Office of the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance, is working on the identification and labeling, in the National Budget, of activities and programs related to adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>In a complementary way, the next IBA will report the needs and support received in terms of international cooperation, formulated based on a robust and transparent national methodology in such a way as to allow its continuous and consistent monitoring.</p>
<p>Through these instruments and initiatives, the Argentine Republic will develop its long-term climate financing strategy based on the correct identification of needs and priorities.</p>

<h3 id="líneas-prioritarias">8.2 Priority lines</h3>

<p>Table 43 presents an initial, non-binding and non-exhaustive analysis of the means of implementation prioritized for the Second Contribution Determined at the National Level. For each axis, required levels of support are established in terms of capacity building, technology development and transfer, and concessional financing:</p>
<p>+++ indicates a high need, ++ a moderate need and + a low need.</p>
<p>In particular, the very high priority of financing as donations for adaptation measures that strategically serve particularly vulnerable areas and sectors of the Argentine Republic stands out.</p>
<p>For their part, the strategic priorities of the provincial jurisdictions in terms of climate policy is to obtain funds and jurisdictional and regional financing policies that allow compliance with the actions required in art. 20 of the Climate Change Law, and the permanent strengthening of the institutions that carry out climate policy in each jurisdiction, regarding access and installation of capacities for the construction of technical equipment.</p>

<h2>9. Monitoring and updating</h2>
<h3>9.1 introduction</h3>

<p>Domestic follow-up and monitoring of the progress of the Second NDC is essential to achieve the effective implementation of climate action at both the national and global levels. In this sense, the continuous reporting of information from the Parties makes it possible to evaluate progress in relation to compliance with the global objectives of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>In this line, the monitoring and updating of the Second NDC is framed within the guidelines of the Climate Change Law regarding the PNAyMCC, created by article 16 of the norm, which will be the main instrument for implementation. of the mitigation and adaptation actions of this Second NDC.</p>
<p>For its part, as established in article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement and in accordance with the Climate Change Law, the NDC of the Argentine Republic will be updated every 5 years, taking into account the process of continuous improvement of the accuracy, the transparency and robustness of information related to climate change policies. The INGEI strengthening process is particularly relevant, with the main objective of reflecting the country's mitigation efforts in the estimates made.</p>

<h3>9.2 Monitoring and mitigation update</h3>

<p>As detailed above, the monitoring of progress in the implementation of the mitigation goal of the Second NDC will be carried out through INGEI, reported in subsequent IBAs, CNs and in future IBTs, as established in paragraph 17 of Decision 4 / CMA 1.</p>
<p>Considering the relevance of climate change reports in the transparency system of the UNFCCC and in order to guarantee methodological consistency between communication and the implementation of the Second NDC, its monitoring will take place within the framework of the SNI-GEI -AR, member of the National Information System on Climate Change. The SNI-GEI-AR is an information support system based on inter-institutional interactions and standardized procedures for the exchange of data, and the validation and periodic compilation of transparent inventories. In addition, this system makes it possible to evaluate the consistency of the INGEI with the mitigation actions of the PNAyMCC for the domestic implementation of the Second NDC, providing the technical inputs necessary for planning policies in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>Another fundamental piece of the National Information System on Climate Change is the National System for Monitoring Mitigation Measures, created in 2018, with the aim of monitoring the implementation of the actions included in the sectoral plans developed within the framework of the GNCC -subject in themselves to periodic review- and to comply with international reporting commitments, either in the form of CN, IBA, or future IBTs, in an efficient and periodic manner. This system is based on a set of appropriate indicators to monitor the degree of progress of each action, depending on the availability of information sources.</p>

<h3>9.3 Monitoring and evaluation of adaptation</h3>

<p>The vehicle for monitoring the adaptation process of the Argentine Republic will be the PNAyMCC through its own monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system. The purpose of the system is to monitor the progress of the implementation and the results of the PNAyMCC and to identify improvements in the management of the adaptation process for learning and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>The level of application of the M&amp;E system of the PNAyMCC will be national. However, general indicators will be formulated in conjunction with COFEMA for the subnational level.</p>
<p>This system will allow, in turn, to monitor the effectiveness of the adaptation process, provide appropriate information for decision-making - thus improving governance -, specify information on new or greater resource needs for adaptation, and identify points for improvement. , among other. Likewise, this system will allow the disaggregation of information by gender.</p>
<p>Finally, the system will allow the generation of relevant information in relation to the impacts of climate change and adaptation in accordance with the provisions of the Reinforced Framework on Transparency of Action and Support (article 13 of the Paris Agreement), whose guidelines on the matter of adaptation were included in Chapter IV of the Annex to Decision 18 / CMA1 in general, and in its sections E and F in particular.</p>
