  <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
  <p>The development of Antigua and Barbuda’s 2021 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) was led by the Department of Environment (DOE) based within the Ministry of Health, Wellness and the Environment and in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and over 15 other government entities. The DOE as well as the respective government entities consulted with NGOs, community groups and the private sector.</p>
  <p>The Government of Antigua and Barbuda (GoAB) would like to gratefully acknowledge the generous support received from the NDC Partnership through its Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) initiative to update Antigua and Barbuda’s NDC. Special thanks to our implementing partners Climate Analytics, the Global Green Growth Institute, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Regional Collaboration Centre, the Caribbean Cooperative MRV Hub, OECS Commission, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNECLAC (United National Economic Commission) Trinidad Office, and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) for the technical assistance provided in the production of key studies, technical papers, policy papers, as well as support given in the conduct of consultations. The NDC also benefited from the reviews and comments of these implementing partners as well as local and international experts.</p>
  <p>Special thanks to The Honourable Molwyn Joseph, Minister for Health, Wellness and the Environment, for his unwavering commitment to advance this ambitious climate change agenda, while Antigua and Barbuda faced an outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <p>Significant contributions to the process were made by a wide-cross section of stakeholders from the public and private sector, civil society, trade and industry groups and training institutions, who attended NDC-related workshops, consultations and participated in key stakeholder interviews organized to inform the NDC update.</p>
  <p>Thanks to the DOE's Project Management Unit and the commitment of its interns and apprentices, who worked tirelessly to collect much needed baseline data and to find alternative ways of engaging with stakeholders during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <h3>Message from the Honourable Gaston Browne</h3>
  <p>Prime Minister & Minister of Finance, Corporate Governance & Public Private Partnerships</p>
  <p>As a Party to the Paris Agreement, Antigua and Barbuda has committed itself to pursuing the global goal of holding global average temperature to well below 2°C and focusing efforts to limit the rise to 1.5°C. To address this challenge, our country is taking bold steps to update and implement its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Our main actions are focused within the transition away from imported energy to grow a new nationally sourced energy sector based on hybrid systems of wind, solar, batteries, LNG, LPG and eventually hydrogen. The aim is to build physical and financial resilience across our entire economy through economic growth in the energy sector.</p>
  <p>To accelerate the energy transition, our country will grow a new energy sector that puts focus on local generation of energy using an abundance of wind and solar to replace 86% of fossil fuel imports by 2030. The transition to a new energy sector is a long-term process that requires changes on many levels and will be accompanied with adequate policies to ensure sustainable and socially inclusive growth for all citizens, particularly women.</p>
  <p>We remain committed to increasing our ambition to cut emissions, scale up renewable energy, support a socially inclusive energy transition and a just transition of our workforce. We are advancing efforts to build a national climate resilient insurance scheme to increase protection of home and business owners, farmers, and fishers.</p>
  <p>Our country is confronted with more frequent and intense tropical storms and hurricanes and is prone to droughts, intense floods, rising air temperatures, decreased annual rainfall and sea level rise. Its economic vulnerability has increased following every extreme weather event— such as Hurricane Irma in 2017 that was nothing short of devasting and hit us at our core. An estimated 80.4% of our country’s gross domestic product (GDP) is at risk due to economic and natural disaster shocks.</p>
  <p>Under pressure to recover, we have had to divert critical financing away from meeting development challenges to climate change loss and damage response programmes. The harmful effects of climate change are indeed growing, and inaction will cost human lives and livelihoods.</p>
  <p>In our NDC, Antigua and Barbuda was careful to include into our targets regional hopes and plans in an effort to recognize that we want to work with our OECS colleagues to face the threat of climate change together.</p>
  <p>The implementation of our NDC will be designed to support the creation of new jobs, stimulate new investments in renewable energy and the development of green business opportunities. For the transition to be successful, no one must be left behind, especially disadvantaged, and vulnerable groups. While my government recognizes the importance to transition to a low-carbon economy, such a shift should not be at the detriment of our people, their wellbeing, their livelihoods, and their way of life.</p>
  <h3>Message from the Honourable Sir Molwyn M. Joseph</h3>
  <p>Minister of Health, Wellness & The Environment</p>
  <p>Antigua and Barbuda like other small island developing states (SIDS) are forced to endure the impacts of a climate crisis, not of our own making. Given this climate challenge, as part of our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), we are preparing to develop a robust national energy system powered by natural energy resources such as solar and wind. Delaying transformation of our energy system and other climate actions will only serve to worsen Antigua and Barbuda’s vulnerability and exposure to climate-related risks.</p>
  <p>Pursuing an energy transition, undoubtedly presents a myriad of opportunities as well as challenges for the most vulnerable in society, particularly, as it relates to accessing and affording energy. Currently, our communities, households and businesses are hard hit by rising energy costs.</p>
  <p>We also acknowledge that vulnerable groups are an integral part of the low-carbon transition. To ensure participation, they will be introduced to social inclusion and investment opportunities that promote the economic benefits of renewable energy and energy efficiency options. The challenges faced by these groups are varied and tend to be exacerbated by climate change and its negative impacts.</p>
  <p>A key priority is removing barriers that inhibit female-headed households and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) from accessing back-up renewable energy generation and storage systems to support their post-extreme weather event recovery. To allow households in vulnerable communities to better cope with the financial impacts of climate change, they will be introduced to micro-financing programmes to facilitate their access to affordable renewable energy products and services.</p>
  <p>A just transition of the workforce by 2030 remains at the heart of our transition policies. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda (GoAB), led by the Honourable Gaston Browne, envisions the creation of new skillsets and enhancement of capabilities to strengthen this effort. Our ambitious plans to increase renewable energy generation will require us to expand workers’ renewable energy capacity within the next decade.</p>
  <p>Apprenticeship programmes targeting individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds will help prepare a new workforce for a net-zero future. New entrants to the labour market and current workers will be trained and re-trained to operate and maintain renewable energy technologies; and adopt new standards and practices.</p>
  <p>To cope with such transformational shifts, businesses will need to adapt their models and ready their operations for change. Our climate action plans are focused on building the entrepreneurial capacity of women, youth, and MSMEs. We will work to stimulate growth in green businesses that implement renewable energy and adaptation interventions.</p>
  <p>In collaboration with key government entities, civil society, and the private sector along with supporting legislative frameworks and much needed climate finance a lot of this work and the change that we seek can be realized.</p>

  <p>UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC)</p>
  <p>for the period of 2020 - 2030 Communicated to the UNFCCC on 2nd September 2021</p>
  <p>This submission communicates Antigua and Barbuda’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution to the global response to climate change (NDC) in line with the <i>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992</i> and its <i>Paris Agreement 2015</i>.</p>
      <h3>1. Background</h3>
      <p>Antigua and Barbuda, as a Party to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992 (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement 2015, submitted its first Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in October 2015. The INDC subsequently became a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and Antigua and Barbuda ratified the <i>Paris Agreement on Climate Change</i> in December 2016. Pursuant to Article 4 of the <i>Paris Agreement</i>, and in an effort towards contributing to limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, Antigua and Barbuda hereby submits its updated NDC. This NDC will cover the period 2020 to 2030 and it includes targets for mitigation and adaptation as well as targets that are designed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Reduce transitional risks,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Support vulnerable groups, including women, the elderly and people living with disabilities</p>
        </li>

      <p>As agreed in Decision 1 CP/20 para 11, “Small island developing states may communicate information on strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emission development reflecting their special circumstances in the context of intended nationally determined contributions.” The NDC targets represent a significant increase in scope and ambition compared to the INDC, specifically, in mitigation ambition and adaptation, with supporting actions in the areas of loss and damage response, gender responsive approaches in access to finance, and the just transition of the workforce.</p>
      <h3>2. Summary of the NDC</h3>
      <p>The NDC targets included in this submission are based on the 1.5°C mitigation goal and adaptation goals that assume a 3.4°C increase in global temperatures (based on projections from the assessments of the INDCs). The targets are aligned with the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s (GoAB) goal of net-zero by 2040. These targets are intended to be met by using relevant technologies, policies such as land use planning and updated building codes, with financial instruments such as catastrophic insurance instruments for extreme weather events. The targets are set to be conditional, or unconditional based on information and assumptions available about technology costs as well as transitional risks. Considering the climate impacts over the first five years of the INDC, the next 10 years may result in over 0.5 billion of climate damage in the country. The approach is, therefore, an urgency to become resilient as fast as possible to reduce the cost of these impacts and reduce the transitional risks related to climate change.</p>
      <p>This updated NDC is an update of the 2015 INDC and does not replace the previously communicated targets as set out in the INDC. Rather, the updated NDC maintains targets not met and updated some targets to reflect more ambition. The INDC was a 10-year document and is still relevant as all targets were not achieved. This NDC is building on the achievements of the last five years and new information on marked decreases in technology cost, which has allowed more ambition for some targets.</p>
      <p>This NDC has its strategy and approaches aligned with the developmental priorities of the country and where appropriate, examined a sector coupling approach for the energy and agricultural sectors, energy and resilience building, Energy and Transportation and decoupling of energy for economic growth. If successful, this approach should reduce the overall cost of mitigation and adaptation projects, while reducing the importation of fossil fuel and concentrating on the abundant solar and wind energy resources. This approach also recognizes the transitional risks that may result from implementing an inclusive energy transition, considering that the roles and hopes of men, women and youth are different; thus, the process should ensure differences are respected and supported to ensure that no one is left behind.</p>
      <p>The NDC further considers the financial challenges as well as transitional risks expected during the implementation phase. The NDC recognizes the need for gender responsive approaches, and a just transition of the workforce. It notes immense challenges, concerns, and uncertainty, but also offers opportunities for new businesses for citizens of Antigua and Barbuda.</p>
      <h3>3. Methods of NDC Preparation</h3>
      <p>Antigua and Barbuda began its NDC revision process in 2019. The process was led by the UNFCCC focal point, the Department of Environment (DOE), based within the Ministry responsible for the Environment and with the support of the Ministry of Finance. The process was</p>
      <p>supported by NDC Partnership's Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) initiative, the United Nations Development Programme’s Climate Promise initiative, IRENA’s Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Lighthouses Initiative, Green Climate Fund’s Readiness (4) Project, and the 4th National Communications Project. The DOE led the execution of several technical studies in the areas of energy, gender, just transition and socially inclusive transition. These studies built upon existing national and strategic priorities to inform the final targets as well as the collection of primary data from over 1,700 participants to support emerging views and opportunities for a strategic approach for the implementation of the targets. The NDC revision process was inclusive and included a whole-of-society, and whole of government approach to the extent permitted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The process engaged the public sector, private sector, and civil society through meetings, focus groups, workshops, stakeholder interviews, public awareness campaigns, household surveys, business surveys and online consultations.</p>
      <p>The NDC targets are aligned with significant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the co-benefits have been identified. The NDC is fully supporting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs, with the aim to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, beginning with eradicating poverty (SDG1) in line with the “leaving no one behind” principle.</p>

      <h3>4. Areas of Additional Targets Since INDC</h3>
            <h4>4.1 Gender</h4>
            <p>Addressing the gender dimension of climate change is a priority in Antigua and Barbuda due to the gender differentiated impacts and vulnerabilities experienced by women and men associated to climate change and their gender differentiated contributions to mitigation and adaptation actions and climate resilience. The GoAB has conducted baseline gender assessments to identify multiple cases of vulnerability to climate change among men and women as well as identifying the differential adaptive capacity to climate change. The overall outcome is to ensure that projects and programmes are gender responsive: meaning that it aims to go beyond gender sensitivity to actively promote gender equality and women’s empowerment.</p>
            <p>The country is committed to achieving SDG 5: Gender equality by promoting low carbon development where men and women contributions to climate change mitigation and adaptation are recognized and valued, existing gender inequalities are reduced and opportunities for effective empowerment for women are promoted.</p>
            <p>To achieve this objective, Antigua and Barbuda will recognize and integrate the different and complementary roles of men and women into policies and strategies on climate change and will ensure that the implementation of the NDC will be gender responsive. This approach will ensure that the NDC implementation a) recognizes and acknowledges gender norms and inequalities and responds to them by creating actions, policies, and initiatives to address the different needs, constraints, and opportunities of women and men and b) ensures that women and men's differential needs are addressed; that participation of women and men is equitable; and that distribution of benefits, resources, status, and rights are equitably attended.</p>
            <p>As links between climate impacts, energy access and gender are critical, therefore, Antigua and Barbuda recognizes the gendered aspect of energy poverty and how it disproportionately affects women and girls. Antigua and Barbuda will mainstream gender in its energy planning through an Inclusive Renewable Energy Strategy. This strategy will recognize and acknowledge, among other things, the gender norms, and inequalities prevalent in the energy sector, women and men’s differentiated access to energy, their different energy needs and preferences, and different impacts that energy access could have on their livelihoods. Antigua and Barbuda’s plan for an inclusive renewable energy transition will ensure continued affordable and reliable access to electricity and other energy services for all. This is in line with the gender responsive targets for mitigation, adaptation and just transition sections:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>100% of female-headed households have all barriers removed to access back-up renewable energy generation and storage systems (i.e., 20,000 homes), 20% increase in the number of women-led businesses implementing renewable energy and adaptation interventions;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>100% of community businesses and organizations that support women in their post-extreme weather event recovery are identified and provided with support for their efforts to facilitate women’s ability to resume work/livelihoods; and</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Develop a gender-responsive approach to the just transition of men in the energy and construction sectors (Baseline: currently approximately 95% men in these sectors)</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4.2 Children and Youth</h4>
            <p>Antigua and Barbuda is developing a National Youth Policy that will place focus on youth development and promote their involvement in environmental issues. The country will continue its promotion of environmental education to support the delivery of its climate change ambitions.</p>
            <p>The country’s UNFCCC Focal Point is further undertaking the development of a Youth Engagement Strategy and Action Plan that will be designed in line with the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) commitments, to facilitate the involvement of children and youth, including the most vulnerable. The Strategy and Action Plan will serve as the framework for youth engagement as part of the GoAB’s Climate Change Programme and will primarily support the engagement of youth in adaptation and mitigation initiatives. It will also equip them with the skills needed to be part of an expansion of social inclusion opportunities. This will be linked to inclusive investment opportunities in renewable energy and the new project funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) - <i>FP133: Resilience to hurricanes in the building sector in Antigua and Barbuda</i>, which aims to generate interest in the field of renewable energies (including among students).</p>
            <p>As part of just transition initiatives, the country’s UNFCCC Focal Point is expanding training and skills development programmes in collaboration with training providers to enable the creation of new jobs in the labour force, enhance youth employability and ensure their access to meaningful and decent work.</p>
            <p>Antigua and Barbuda is also committed to ensuring that ACE becomes, as per Article 12 of the Paris Agreement, a key cross-cutting instrument to involve all levels of society in climate action, in particular children and youth (as well as other vulnerable groups including women, the elderly and people living with disabilities) in support of all elements of mitigation and adaptation. ACE has the potential to provide the social and political will for action, in addition to the scientific and technological know-how. As such, the country’s ACE commitments, as non-GHG targets, will help accelerate the achievement of the NDC’s GHG related targets.</p>
            <h4>4.3 Vulnerable Groups</h4>
      <p>Along with gender equity, Antigua and Barbuda recognize that climate change disproportionately impacts the vulnerable groups of the country. Climate change impacts increase financial exclusion and is also a barrier to financial stability. As part of the GoAB’s Inclusive Renewable Energy Strategy, inclusive programmes are proposed that will facilitate the involvement of vulnerable communities in the energy transition and help them build resiliency and mitigate losses that are caused by climate change.</p>

      <h4>5.1. Progress Since Submission of the INDC</h4>
      <p>To date, Antigua and Barbuda has made significant strides towards the implementation and achievement of its 2015 INDC targets. The INDC was a ten-year plan and the first few years focused on the establishment of an enabling legal, policy and institutional environment, and capacity building activities to build the resilience of Antigua and Barbuda and reduce emissions. This enabling environment includes the enactment of the Renewable Energy Act of 2015 and the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA) of 2019<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> which included provisions for the formation of the Sustainable Island Resource Framework Fund (SIRF Fund). The updating of the Country’s Building Code, in addition to policies in energy and the environment such as the National Energy Policy<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the Sustainable Energy Action Plan.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
      <p>A detailed assessment of the targets and what was accomplished since the INDC has not been completed yet but will be done by the end of 2021.</p>
      <h3>6. Means of Implementation of the NDC</h3>
      <p>The mitigation and adaptation targets presented in this NDC are contingent upon receiving international support for technology transfer, capacity-building and financial resources, including through the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Adaptation Fund (AF), multilateral and bilateral agreements and the local private sector. This support is required as the frequency and intensity of impacts is well above the ability of the country’s Government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and private sector to adapt. The country’s strategy, therefore, is to effectively and efficiently use climate finance to leverage local resources from the Government and the private sector by establishing the necessary national enabling environment to allow for the flow of funds.</p>
      <p>The indicative cost for Antigua and Barbuda’s identified NDC measures through 2030 is between USD 1 billion and USD 1.7B for mitigation and adaptation actions. The exact cost for these activities will be further developed over the next few years. As a result of low international ambition for mitigation as well as still very high subsidies for financing of carbon intensive activities, the cost of adaptation is expected to continue to increase and even go beyond the ability of certain sectors to adapt. Antigua and Barbuda with such a small economy is not able to pay for the incremental cost of adaptation and mitigation while supporting the development agenda of the country.</p>
      <p>To support implementation of the updated NDC and to develop key policies, Antigua and Barbuda with external support undertook a series of detailed technical analysis, including, inter alia, a National Greenhouse Gas Reduction Report<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, a Renewable Energy Roadmap<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, baseline assessments towards the development of a national insurance scheme, baseline analysis for the electricity and transport sector for Antigua and Barbuda towards the Framework for the Just Transition of the Workforce, a Policy Guide to Inclusive Investment Opportunities in Renewable Energy in Antigua and Barbuda 2020-2025<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> with associated strategy and work plan, National Gender Assessment Survey: The Economic Impact of Climate Change on Men and Women in Antigua and Barbuda<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and an Affordability and Accessibility of Renewable Energy Household Survey.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This process helped the country to identify opportunities and strategies for cost reduction while managing transitional risk as well as understanding the role of men, women, and youth in a series of detailed technical and policy analysis.</p>
      <p>At present, there are several barriers to financing the NDC and meeting the targets: (i) The greatest barrier is access to highly concessional finance, Antigua and Barbuda is classified as a high-income country and is no longer considered for concessional financing for its development agenda. Financing classified for climate change mitigation and resilience as well as reconstruction after an extreme weather event is generally categorized by the international community as developmental financing to which the GDP access criteria may be explicitly, or administratively applied. Climate spending for developing countries, especially SIDS, is not considered developmental spending. But it is considered spending that the countries are forced to make due to GHG emissions pollution from other countries. Since the polluter principle is not being enforced at the international level, the cost of the impacts falls on each country, but particularly SIDS, which are disproportionately impacted. These funds should not be subjected to the GDP eligibility criteria. Most countries would prefer not to have to spend on climate change resilience if they do not need to. (ii) The <strong>lack of access to technologies</strong> at the prices and the quality that developed countries have access; and (iii) Finally <strong>SIDS’ private sector and NGOs</strong> do not have access to financing as their counterparts in more developed countries and therefore cannot adequately compete. This reduces the competitiveness of the already small private sector in SIDS and in Antigua and Barbuda there is no exception. These barriers are a great risk to the transition to a low-emission and resilient economy. Without addressing these risks, Antigua and Barbuda can face gentrification, have its protected areas used for developmental purposes or privatized, and experience increases in the cost of living, which will result in hardships for the high number of single-parent or single income homes in country. It is imperative, therefore, that the issue to access funding at acceptable rates is urgently addressed.</p>
      <p>To assist the country to address these barriers, its Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA), 2019 included provisions for the establishment of the SIRF Fund. The SIRF Fund forms part of the accredited institutional structure of the Department of Environment. The department is accredited to the AF as a National Implementing Entity and to the GCF. In addition, the Department of Environment is now a Delivery Partner for Readiness for the GCF and the AF. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is also working to expand the range of financial instruments it plans to access and deploy into the economy thus relying less and less on loans.</p>
      <h3>7. Accompanying Information on Antigua and Barbuda’s Updated NDC</h3>
          <p>7.1 General Information and National Circumstances</p>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda is a small island developing state (SIDS) in the Caribbean Sea consisting of two main inhabited islands and several smaller islands, with a total land area amounting to ~456 km.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Antigua is the larger of the two islands at 280 km, while Barbuda — which is 40 km north of Antigua — has a land area of 176 km.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Both islands are low-lying with 70% of the land in Antigua less than 30 m above mean sea level and most of Barbuda only 3 m above mean sea level.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
          <p>The country’s economy is heavily dependent on natural resources, low-lying coastal zones, and favourable climate conditions to support the tourism sector, which accounts for about 80% of output gross domestic product (GDP), about 70% of direct and indirect employment and 85% of foreign exchange earnings. Despite a high-income ranking, approximately 18% of the total population (which is above 97,000) falls below the national poverty line<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>; 3.7% indigent (food poor); and 10% vulnerable to poverty in the event of a significant socio-economic shock or natural hazard.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> When considering the proportion of the population that is at risk of falling into poverty if there is a shock to the economy,<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> the percentage rises to 28%.</p>
          <p>This barrier has placed a strain on the country, limiting its ability to maintain economic growth and requiring the diversion of critical financing away from health and other development sectors to climate change loss and damage response programmes.</p>
          <h4>7.2 Climate Vulnerability of Antigua and Barbuda</h4>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda is exposed economically, environmentally and socially to projected climate change impacts which will result in a greater intensity of hurricanes, more frequent droughts, high temperatures and sea-level rise.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Downscaled climate projections to inform detailed risk modelling for Antigua and Barbuda indicate that Antigua stands to lose approximately 26.6 to 35.3 square kilometres of low-lying coastal land to sea level rise by 2080.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The estimated value of assets on this land is USD196 to USD 293 million. Similarly, Barbuda is projected to lose between 24.2 and 29.6 square kilometres of land, as well as assets valued at between USD 68.9 and USD 123.9 million.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
          <p>Analysis of climate change for the islands also projects accelerated coastal erosion and inundation, lower average annual rainfall, increased rainfall intensity causing flooding, prolonged periods of drought, and an increase in tropical cyclones frequency and intensity.</p>
          <p>Economic and natural disaster shocks put an estimated 80.4% of the country’s GDP at risk. The country is still recovering from the economic and social fallout caused by the devasting Hurricane Irma in 2017. The country suffered damage and loss of USD155.1 million (10% of GDP) impacting houses, public buildings, hotels, firms engaged in tourism sector and safety nets of vulnerable households.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In Barbuda, 95% of the housing stock was damaged or destroyed and the entire population of 1,600 persons were evacuated to Antigua following the devastation.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
          <p>Between 2015 and 2020 (the INDC period), the combined cost incurred to Antigua and Barbuda from tropical storms and hurricanes was USD232 million. On average, hurricanes account for 8.4% of the annual loss in GDP for Antigua and Barbuda.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The combined immediate post-event damages caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 — which equated to USD136 million — lowered Antigua and Barbuda’s GDP growth rate by 1.1% because of reduced tourism infrastructure and increased spending on relief efforts and repairs.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
          <h4>7.3 Adaptation</h4>
          <p>Under Article 2, one of the Paris Agreement goals is to strengthen the global climate change response by enhancing the adaptive capacity and resiliency, and reducing vulnerability. Antigua and Barbuda, as one of the most vulnerable countries to the negative impacts of climate change, recognizes the importance of this goal and has decided to include an adaptation component in its updated NDC. Antigua and Barbuda’s adaptation action will follow a gender-responsive, participatory, and fully transparent approach, taking into consideration vulnerable groups.</p>
          <p>Since the year 2001, Antigua and Barbuda has been up to date with its UNFCCC reporting commitments. Antigua and Barbuda has presented three National Communications, in 2001, 2011 and 2015 respectively, with the 4th National Communication under development and its First Biennial Update Report in 2020, highlighting the current and future impacts of climate change. The National Communications elaborate in detail the impact of climate change on the weather- and climate-sensitive sectors.</p>
              <p>7.3.1 Sustainable Development Alignment Planning</p>
              <p>Antigua and Barbuda’s development is guided by a national physical development plan, a requirement under the <i>Physical Planning Act 2003,</i> which is updated periodically.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 2012, the Cabinet of Antigua and Barbuda approved the Sustainable Island Resource Management and Zoning Plan (SIRMZP) to serve as the updated national physical development plan, which presents a forward-looking strategic, national spatial development framework that addresses current development issues, and provides a platform for feasible private and public-sector development initiatives, reflecting local cultural values and aspirations over the next twenty years.</p>
              <p>Additionally, Antigua and Barbuda is currently preparing its National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which will be submitted to the UNFCCC by 2022. This NAP project aims to contribute to the achievement of the 2015 Paris Agreement’s global goal on adaptation by mainstreaming evidence-based adaptation planning processes and implementation into the day-to-day operations of Antigua and Barbuda’s public and private sectors. The National Adaptation Planning process is a hybrid approach, incorporating sector focused adaptation planning with broad national assessments to form a comprehensive strategic plan for national adaptation planning. The priority sectors are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Finance</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Protected/Managed Areas</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Infrastructure and Housing</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Tourism</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Food Security</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Wholesale and Retail</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The NAP will be used to update the SIRMZP to ensure recent climate information is included as well to inform actions to achieve progress towards accomplishing NDC targets.</p>
              <p>Guided by its NDC, Antigua and Barbuda’s NAP process involves, inter alia: downscaled and GIS-based baseline data collection and climate risk assessment activities for adaptation action; evidence-based and consultative sectoral and local areas planning; and development of a corresponding enabling environment via policies, legislation, and financial incentives necessary for the implementation of the selected adaptation actions. Through climate modelling, Antigua and Barbuda will predict future impacts of climate change and assess current and future risk from tropical cyclones (wind and storm surge), drought (increased temperatures and low precipitation), marine heat waves, and sea level rise. This data will form the basis of vulnerability risk assessments for sectoral adaptation plans that will help assess exposure to climate risks, climate- related hazards, and vulnerability to climate change the sectoral level.</p>
              <p>Adaptation planning at the Local Area Planning (LAP) scale (i.e., community and parish level), as well will help the GoAB understand the spatial distribution and quantification of catastrophe risk in a changing climate at a local scale. The GoAB also intends to implement regulations, which recognise the need for the integration of risk information into the adaptation planning framework. Monitoring and reporting on the varied adaptation outcomes is important for Antigua and Barbuda to accurately reflect its efforts and contribute to achieving the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA).</p>
          <p>7.4 Loss and Damage Response</p>
          <p>The country struggles with an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes, and severe droughts, rising temperatures, a decrease in annual rainfall and sea level rise, all of which impact people, affect livelihoods and businesses. Additionally, the passage of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the region have driven up insurance prices. Antigua and Barbuda considers a loss and damage response to be addressing the actual harm associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events.</p>
          <p>As a SIDS, extreme weather events have significant negative impacts on the lives and livelihoods of local communities and economy, and result in considerable recovery and rehabilitation costs after an event. Some of these extreme weather events include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>More frequent and intense tropical cyclones</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>More frequent and intense droughts</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Heat waves</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Storm surges</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Torrential rains and flooding</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
              <p>Slow on-set events also cumulatively affect the lives and livelihoods of the population as well as the wider economy, but at a slower pace than extreme weather events. These events include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Sea level rise</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Desertification</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Ocean acidification</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda (both the public and private sectors) spends large amounts in addressing the economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. This happens in response to both extreme weather events and slow onset events, when increases in spending on capital as well as recurrent expenditure are experienced.</p>
          <p>Such financing of domestic loss and damage response reduces the fiscal space of a country and slows down ongoing development to address the immediate needs of the climate-related extreme weather event, or slow onset event. On the public sector side of things, it incurs high costs. The funding for such a response is normally non-concessional given the government’s income status. This creates further pressure on the country’s economy and fiscal stability. That said, solutions such as debt-for-climate swaps assist in reducing our debt burden and creates much needed fiscal space for our national response to the adverse effects of climate change and its associated loss and damage.</p>
          <p>For the private sector, they experience similar issues but within their context. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Temporary or permanent loss of livelihoods (<i>for e.g., loss of tourism-related job post- hurricane or loss of crops due to a severe drought</i>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Damage to or permanent loss of assets (<i>for e.g., damage to the floor of a home or destruction of a hotel as result of a hurricanes</i>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Capital flight (<i>for e.g., international financial institutions closing/selling local branches to avoid loss and damage of their asset from sea level rise or more frequent and intense hurricanes</i>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Temporary or permanent increased costs of goods and services (for e.g., increased insurance premiums, food, building supplies)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda recognizes that non-economic losses associated with the adverse effects of climate change present real and devasting consequences for our population, livelihoods, way of life, health, human mobility and disaster displacement. The evacuation of Barbuda during the 2017 hurricane season shed light on the multifaceted needs of displaced persons and the importance of comprehensive and timely response systems.</p>
          <p>Given the country’s exposure and vulnerability, Antigua and Barbuda has proposed the implementation of gender-responsive national schemes that will offer risk management tools, such as parametric or indemnity insurance, that will allow farmers, fishers, residential and commercial business owners to cope with losses resulting from increased climate variability<i>.</i> The proposed schemes are in line with the loss and damage action of: <i>Farmers, fishers, and residential and business owners have access to comprehensive and tailored national programmes that allow them to affordably manage and transfer risks resulting from increasing climate variability.</i></p>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda is further seeking to increase the climate resilience of households with climate-vulnerable livelihoods that depend upon the fisheries and agricultural sectors by:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Strengthening the physical climate resilience of the fisheries and agricultural sectors to slow onset and extreme weather events through the identification and implementation of priority adaptation interventions, with a focus on ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA); and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Managing remaining extreme weather risk to climate-vulnerable livelihoods and food security by building the financial resilience of vulnerable households to climate shocks. Financial climate resilience will be achieved through the development and implementation of sustainable <i>ex ante</i> risk financing, including the design and deployment of novel risk financing products through a pilot livelihood protection programme, catalysing private sector investment into additional sustainable risk financing products for the fisheries and agricultural sectors to further support livelihood security under future climate change conditions.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes is already evident in the country with the return rate of Category 4 hurricanes rising from 1 in 50 years in the first half of the 20th century to 1 in 10 years. In 2017, the country experienced and was affected by its first recorded Category 5 hurricanes in history — Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Irma, directly hit Barbuda and resulted in the destruction of ~95% of all infrastructure on the island. The combined impact of the 2017 hurricanes amounted to ~USD136 million in damages and ~USD19 million in post hurricane economic losses, with total recovery costs estimated at USD222 million.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
          <p>Following a major weather event, such as a hurricane, critical infrastructure networks, including power and water supply in Antigua and Barbuda can be disrupted for 3 - 24 months, while damage to communication and transport infrastructure disrupts associated services for up to 6 months. These disruptions have considerable impacts on the country’s economy. Disruptions can extend to the importation of goods such as food and medicine, which are mostly imported and have implications for the health and wellness of local communities. The damage to critical public service infrastructure also curtails the capacity of emergency services to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, which further exacerbates the impacts outlined. To increase the adaptative capacity of the infrastructure, adaptation targets are introduced such as <i>100% of community and sports infrastructure and assets are climate resilient (to withstand at a minimum Category 4 tropical cyclones) and have adequate water harvesting and storage systems.</i></p>
          <p>Given the projected increase in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes and the vulnerability of the energy system to these extreme events, Antigua and Barbuda plans to expand the use of renewable energy within household back up energy systems. This is in line with the adaptation target of <i>30,000 homes or 50% of pre-2020 homes to have back-up renewable energy systems for at least 4–6 hours of energy.</i> This will be implemented through the target <i>Building Code updated and passed into law in line with a climate resilient development pathway including, inter alia, a requirement that all new homes built after 2025 have back-up renewable energy generation and storage systems.</i></p>
          <p>7.5 Mitigation</p>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda’s total emissions are negligible globally as it contributes less than 0.002% of the global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Despite the low contribution, Antigua and Barbuda will pursue an ambitious mitigation target, which will reflect its highest possible ambition to support the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement - “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”.</p>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda does not possess any known indigenous sources of fossil fuel resources; hence it depends heavily on fossil fuel imports – heavy fuel oil in electricity generation, gasoline and diesel in transport, and liquid petroleum gas for cooking. As a result, the energy sector (including transport) is the major contributor of GHG emissions, emitting 650 Gg CO2e (kt CO2) and accounting for 76% of the total CO2 emissions in 2015.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Fossil fuel imports put an additional burden on the country’s economy; in 2013, the fuel imports amounted to USD 165.4 million, equivalent to 13.7 % of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Additionally, Antigua and Barbuda has one of the world’s highest electricity costs, at USD 0.35/kWh.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda has significant renewable energy resources such a solar and wind that have accelerated the energy transition. To achieve the targets from its first NDC, it has adopted several national and sectoral mitigation actions. Antigua and Barbuda has adopted a programmatic approach oriented towards installing renewable energy plants and innovative grid-interactive renewable energy systems designed to improve resilience during extreme weather events.</p>
          <p>Despite its negligible contribution in the global GHG emission, Antigua and Barbuda is committed in putting forward an ambitious NDC. This updated NDC includes ambitious mitigation target for Energy (electricity generation and transport), Waste and Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector.</p>
          <p>For the energy sector, the two main targets are - 86% renewable energy generation from local resources in the electricity sector by 2030 and 100% of new vehicle sales to be electric vehicles by 2030. While the transport sector target is set to be achieved by 2040, continuous actions will be taken starting 2025. Transforming the transport sector is a radical change and will require a modal shift. Antigua and Barbuda’s transport sector is dominated by fossil fuels with more than 97% of the 54, 891 road transport vehicles in the country fuelled by gasoline and the remaining 2.7% running on diesel. <a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
          <p>It is expected that this transition from predominantly internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EV) will take several years. This is in line with the proposed indicative target of “<i>Ban on the importation of new internal combustion engine vehicles from 2025”.</i></p>
          <p>While the first NDC had a waste sector target of completing technical studies for a waste to energy (WTE) plant, due to shifts in the sector, the DOE will be undertaking technical studies to assess the feasibility of a WTE plant. The updated NDC includes a waste sector target to develop a <i>circular economy policy and regulations.</i></p>
          <p>7.6. Means of Implementation</p>
          <p>In addition to setting ambitious conditional mitigation and adaptation targets, Antigua and Barbuda is determined to create an enabling environment for the implementation of the NDC. To do so, it has undertaken various additional research, assessments, and activities to support the NDC implementation.</p>
              <p>7.6.1. Inclusive Renewable Energy Strategy</p>
              <p>Antigua and Barbuda acknowledges the importance of equity and inclusivity in energy transition and is committed to establishing socially inclusive, gender responsive and accessible investment opportunities in renewable energy through an Inclusive Renewable Energy Strategy.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The aim is to integrate international and regional standards for equitable investment opportunities for its citizens of different gender, people with disabilities, and youth, as well as those households in economic hardship, and MSMEs. Inclusive renewable energy is also a vehicle for entrepreneurship opportunities and households, lowers the cost of energy and can improve livelihoods.</p>
              <p>7.6.2. Financial Strategy to Support Gender Responsive and Socially Inclusive Implementation of the NDC</p>
              <p>The GOAB notes its ability to programme taxes and loans. However, this limited approach in accessing financing has resulted in the government increasing its debt. The Government has, therefore, sought to access other instruments such as grants, and equity, and to leverage the abilities and support of the private sector and NGOs. To this end, the GoAB submitted and received accreditation of its environment department to the Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund and has built the capacity of its Ministry of Finance to execute transformational climate-change related projects. These projects are designed to leverage the work of NGOs and the private sector with support from The SIRF Fund— a national environmental fund that is based within the DOE. This fund can allow for concessional financing to be channelled to vulnerable persons, the private sector, and NGOs for environmental, climate mitigation and adaptation projects.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Government has recently announced the formation of the Climate Resilience and Development Fund (CRDF). The CRDF is financed via a tourist levy and is proposed for implementation in 2021. Alongside international climate finance, between 2014 and 2017 an annual average of 3% budget has been allocated to over 140 actions on climate mitigation and adaptation with an increase anticipated in 2020 and beyond.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Until recently, initiatives supporting the most vulnerable in society have been predominantly focused on adaptation measures like building resilience to flooding and hurricanes. The updated NDC ambition provides an opportunity to focus more intently on enabling access to energy efficiency and renewable energy for the most vulnerable, particularly women who are most affected when electricity is not available since the grid is down after an extreme weather event.</p>
              <p>Nationally, Antigua and Barbuda intends to utilize the SIRF Fund as a mechanism primarily to catalyse and leverage investment in the transition for NGOs, MSMEs and informal sectors that normally cannot access traditional local commercial financing due to perceived high risks. Regionally, Antigua and Barbuda intends to use the national experience to support the development of the SIRF Fund to be able to act as a regional funding mechanism for the OECS countries to fund high risks projects and channel funds to communities and lower income persons at higher risks of climate impact.</p>
              <p>7.6.3. Just Transition of the Workforce</p>
              <p>With Antigua and Barbuda’s commitment to reducing GHG emissions by transitioning to renewables, it foresees an ambitious energy transition. This change in the way energy is produced and consumed will require a significant shift in policies and have an impact on infrastructure in the country. It is anticipated that this will have both positive and negative impacts on jobs and workers’ livelihoods. Transitioning towards phasing out of fossil fuels can become a strong driver of job creation, job upgrading, poverty eradication, social justice and reduce youth unemployment. Antigua and Barbuda is committed to ensuring a just transition of the workforce, keeping the Paris Agreement’s mandate that government should consider “the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities”. Developing a Just Transition will also support the implementation of the NDC and provide inputs to future mitigation actions.</p>
              <p>Antigua and Barbuda is undertaking baseline analysis to inform the framework for the Just Transition based on the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) principles of decent work, green jobs and sustainable development. Subsequent to the development of the framework for the Just Transition, Antigua and Barbuda will develop, in partnership with the national and regional organizations, a training and retraining programme, targeted at the transition towards a low- carbon climate-resilient economy. While the initial work focuses on the emission intensive sectors, the intention is to develop a Just Transition for the whole of economy, focusing on the impacts of developing a new energy sector and the impacts of climate change.</p>
              <p>7.6.4. Data Management and MRV System</p>
              <p>Antigua and Barbuda needs to be able to understand and articulate its key vulnerabilities and risks as well as design and monitor sectoral plans to mobilise investment for increased climate resilience. Antigua and Barbuda also understands the importance of measuring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems in communicating and tracking the country’s climate actions as well as reporting on the progress made in achieving the NDC. Therefore, it is on the path of designing a MRV system. It aims to design a MRV system that focuses on three main areas – MRV of Adaptation (to include loss and damage tracking and reporting), MRV of Mitigation Actions (to include GHG Emissions), and MRV of Climate Support (to include climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building). Part X section 87 of the EPMA, 2019 also defines the institutional arrangements for the MRV system.</p>
              <p>The MRV system for Antigua and Barbuda when in place will enable it to meet the Paris Agreement requirements on transparency and reporting. It will enable the country to be fully aware of its challenges, threats, and options for addressing them that are sensitive to wider strategies and goals for the economy, society, and the environment. The MRV system will help the Government and citizens of Antigua and Barbuda to engage actively in, and benefit from its investment in climate action. The system will promote the collection of sex and age disaggregated data and focus on ensuring that there is sufficient information available for all social/gender groups (including women, children, men, people with disabilities, the elderly and vulnerable and disadvantaged people, etc.) to participate in decision making. The MRV system will support a thriving low emission, climate resilient economy, society, and environment and benefits from a system that is fully integrated in its main growth and development decision making functions.</p>
              <p>7.6.5. Debt-for-Climate-Swap</p>
              <p>The Government of Antigua and Barbuda has proposed a debt-for-climate swap as a means of generating investment for climate adaptation and/or mitigation projects. This is seen as a key strategy to assist Antigua and Barbuda in mobilising finance for climate adaptation and mitigation, while simultaneously reducing its debt burden.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> As a SIDS with a high public debt, Antigua and Barbuda faces constraints in financing climate adaptation and responding to natural disasters. This has subsequently increased its vulnerability to climate change and climate change-related disasters, such as hurricanes, which pose a major threat to sustainable development. The increasing frequency and burden of extreme weather events (such as Category 4 and 5 hurricanes) will continue to erode Antigua and Barbuda’s capacity to service its current debt obligations, whilst also adequately financing further interventions to reduce the vulnerability of its citizens.</p>
              <p>The proposed debt-to-climate swap aligns with first NDC commitments by: (i) increasing the fiscal space necessary to fund climate adaptation and mitigation activities because of reduced debt service requirements; and (ii) directly contributing to financial capacity of the SIRF Fund, which was identified in the first NDC as a central financial institution for meeting conditional commitments.</p>
              <p>7.6.6. NDC Implementation Plan</p>
              <p>Antigua and Barbuda’s NDC Implementation Plan, to be finalized in 2021, will be a roadmap for how the country will achieve its NDC targets. It will develop mitigation, adaptation and climate finance supporting activities, indicators, timelines for implementation, estimated costs as well as enabling actions such as governance and capacity support to advance NDC implementation.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The NDC Implementation Plan will include a capacity building action plan to strengthen the enabling environment to achieve the NDC targets through actions such as enhancing the relevant policy, regulatory and financing frameworks, institutional arrangements as well as ensuring resource allocation processes and capacity development and awareness raising mechanisms, such as a youth engagement strategy. With the NDC Implementation Plan in place, the country will implement several actions to ensure a gender responsive implementation (this will be in compliance with the Gender Action Plan of the UNFCCC). It will be a living document and is expected to be refined and updated continuously to reflect national circumstances, new knowledge and science on climate change and new developments in international climate change negotiations.</p>
              <p>7.6.7. Project Pipeline</p>
              <p>The GoAB’s Climate Change Transformational Programme will initially give priority to projects that build resilience in the building, infrastructure, energy (off –grid back-up energy), micro - finance and health sectors. Priority mitigation projects and programmes are related to grid resilience and stability, transportation, and waste to energy. <a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
              <p>The projects are designed in line with the NDC’s main thematic focus areas, inter alia:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>transition from importing fossil fuels to local generation of renewable energy and energy storage, transportation, and back-up energy sectors;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>national climate resilience insurance scheme for vulnerable groups (including farmers, fisherfolk, and certain households);</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>debt-for-climate swap; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>just transition of the workforce.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The projects will be implemented alongside the development portfolio of the Ministry of Finance. This general approach will allow for coordination of financing including co-financing, improve social and gender inclusion into projects and generate measurable results.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
          <h4>7.7. NDC Alignment with 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</h4>
          <p>Antigua and Barbuda recognizes the importance of building upon the synergies between climate action and sustainable development gains and strives to link the implementation of the NDC with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A particular emphasis will be put on development outcomes that contribute to building the resilience of most vulnerable groups, and social co-benefits of the mitigation measures presented in the NDC. The primary purpose of SDGs is to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, beginning with eradicating poverty (SDG1) in line with the “leaving no one behind” principle. Antigua and Barbuda will therefore work on ensuring a ‘just transition’ to end poverty in all its forms including “through the implementation of appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable to leave no one behind” (<strong>Target 1.3</strong>) and “building the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters” (<strong>Target 1.5</strong>).</p>
          <p>The full implementation of the updated NDC would bring about a significant number of sustainable development co-benefits in Antigua and Barbuda, including but not limited to the SDGs outlined in the figure below.</p>

          <p><img width="517" height="415" alt="image" src="img/ATG-NDC1-1.png"/></p>
          <p>In 2016, Antigua and Barbuda developed a national Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) for 2016-2020 period with a vision of – “a harmonious, prosperous and modern Antigua and Barbuda founded on the principles of sustainability and inclusive growth; where equality of opportunity, peace, and justice prevail for all citizens and residents”.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The implementation of the NDC will also assist in achieving the current and future MTDS, which is currently under development. The government has acknowledged that this can only be attained and guided by the four key principles outlined below:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Optimal Generation of National Wealth</p>
            </li>

        <p>Antigua and Barbuda’s NDC planning process was led by the UNFCCC Focal Point, the Department of Environment. The DOE was supported by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), an inter- agency, multi-stakeholder advisory committee that includes 17 government agencies, three NGOs and community interest groups, and one private sector coalition representative.</p>
        <p>The NDC revision process was inclusive and involved a significant number of stakeholder consultations with public, private, and civil society stakeholders through key informant interviews, meetings, workshops, public awareness campaigns, household surveys, business surveys and online consultations. It included the consultation of over 2,000 nationals with support from the DOE apprenticeship and internship programme, international partners such as the NDC Partnership’s CAEP initiative, IRENA, Climate Analytics, GGGI, OECS Commission, CCMRV Hub, UNDP Climate Promise initiative, and others.</p>
        <p>Social institutions and gender, equality and social inclusion groups were included in the planning process and will be included in the implementation of the NDC. Stakeholder consultations with these institutions also focused on the development of a Social Inclusion and Renewable Energy (RE) Investment Programme that will offer affordable RE energy options to vulnerable groups. This programme will seek to bring about a paradigm shift that considers the needs of vulnerable groups and make them an integral part of the low-carbon transition. It will take a systemic approach by embedding social inclusion and gender-based principles in the GoAB’s policies and strategies to combat climate change.</p>
        <p>Gender-responsive consultations were conducted with farmers and fisherfolk, who experience high incidence of and susceptibility to natural hazards/disasters, such as hurricanes, storms, droughts, and flooding in periods of heavy rainfall. These groups also supported assessments on the likelihood of developing an insurance scheme that can facilitate their recovery after events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods.</p>
        <p>Youth Actions: The country’s UNFCCC Focal Point has introduced capacity building initiatives, internships, and apprenticeships for youth to support them in combatting climate change and its impacts. The country is working on offering sector-based workforce training and certified training opportunities in collaboration with training institutions to facilitate the implementation of climate targets and reducing in the long-run possible negative impacts of the transition. When made available these training and skills development programmes will enable the creation of new jobs in the labour force, enhance youth employability and ensure their access to meaningful and decent work. Additionally, Antigua and Barbuda through its Department of Youth Affairs is also developing the National Youth Policy that will focus on youth development and the green economy.</p>

        <p>Geography: Antigua and Barbuda is a twin island state that lies between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 250 miles southeast of Puerto Rico. It has an exclusive economic zone of 110,071 sq. km. The precise coordinates of Antigua are 17 ̊10’ latitude, 61 ̊55’ longitude, while Barbuda is located 28 miles north of Antigua at latitude 17 ̊35’, and longitude 61 ̊48.</p>
        <p>Climate: Antigua and Barbuda experiences a relatively arid tropical maritime climate. Average monthly temperatures range between 23.9 - 29.6 ̊C, while the average rainfall is about 46.75 inches. The country experiences heavy rainfall from July to December. However, rainfall trends are often variable, and severe droughts may occur every 5-10 years. The country went into the worst drought in its history from 2013-2016. The islands are also prone to hurricanes that tend to occur between June and November. From 1851 to 2011, Antigua and Barbuda has had 93 storm systems, with 44 developing into hurricanes. In September 2017, the country experienced its first-ever Category 5 hurricane according to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. On September 5, 2017, Hurricane Irma hit Barbuda with winds over 185 mph. The hurricane destroyed more than 90% of the infrastructure in Barbuda, leaving the island uninhabitable.</p>
        <p>Economy: Antigua and Barbuda has a service- based economy with tourism being the main driving force of economic growth, accounting for nearly 60% of the total GDP and 40% investment. Tourism directly provides 5,000 jobs and accounts for 18% of total employment in the nation. The financial sector is another major contributor to the GDP. In 2019, Antigua and Barbuda had a GDP of USD 1.662 Billion and GDP per capita of USD 17,112 (World Bank).</p>

            <p><strong>Technology for the transition:</strong> Antigua and Barbuda understands that access to technology is key barrier to a successful transition. The transition will require the use of technologies that are relatively novel to the country’s population as well as decommissioning of old technology in areas such as renewable energy, transportation, and electricity. These technologies will be introduced through new projects that will involve new business models and innovative financial mechanisms such as debt swaps, just transition of the workforce, and socially inclusive investments.</p>

          <li>
            <p><strong>Capacity building at the local level/expertise:</strong> The Government’s ambitious transition requires a wider variety of human and technical capacity for its project pipeline baseline work, coordination, and implementation as well as its role in priority identification and setting, tracking climate finance flows, assessment of fiscal and monetary policy in line with Article 2(1)(c) of the Paris Agreement, strategic impact assessments on the proposed actions, and stakeholder engagements.

        <p>Antigua and Barbuda is a SIDS and highly vulnerable to climate change. Its total GHG emissions are negligible globally, as it contributes to less than 0.002% to the global emissions. The adaptation actions are, however, great since the world seems to be headed towards 3 degrees. The targets are not fair, however, since SIDS are having to spend more on adaptation due to the small targets of the largest emitters. This updated NDC is a significant enhancement of the first NDC and consists of ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions which reflects its highest possible ambition to support Paris Agreement’s temperature goal of limiting the average temperature rise to 1.5°C.</p>

Currently, water for agriculture is provided by RO plants or through surface water catchments. The electrical grid that powers the RO plants run on heavy fuel oil, creating a large dependency for both the food and water sector on the importation and combustion of fossil fuels. This project would introduce technologies that have not been tested in the Agriculture Sector of Antigua and are new to the market.</p>

        <p>Pursuing a transition to a low-carbon economy and more climate-resilient development will require a significant policy shift that will have a major impact on, inter alia, the labour market. In this regard, the GoAB seeks to facilitate a ‘Just Transition’ of affected sector workforces, through institutional and regulatory reforms, retraining and employment schemes, and economic diversification. A Just Transition approach will target those employed in affected fossil fuel- dependent industries (like energy, building and construction, and transportation). Interventions will ensure these employees are supported and protected to guarantee that they have viable livelihoods throughout the transition period, and beyond. Additionally, this approach can also promote the creation and expansion of decent work and quality jobs through the process of building resilience to climate change. This approach will also provide a window of opportunity for women to become involved in sectors normally dominated by men.</p>

        <p>The financial resilience will be created by developing alternative finance models, focusing on financial tools to de-risk investments and improve insurance options, particularly for farmers and fisherfolk.</p>
        <p>The project will also increase climate resilience prior to, and after extreme climate events by engaging the private sector to facilitate investment in climate-smart adaptation interventions in these sectors, as well as rebuilding following extreme events. In addition to the financial resilience, the project will work with farmers and fisherfolk to build the resilience of their livelihood activities to extreme events, including exploring options for renewable energy and land/ocean management frameworks.</p>

        <p>Antigua and Barbuda, already an arid island state, lie in a zone that is expected to receive 30 – 50% less rainfall in 2090 compared to late twentieth century rainfall norms. Surface water will be an increasingly unreliable source of potable freshwater in Antigua and Barbuda due to climate change impacts, with implications for both household storage and cisterns, and national supplies from surface water catchments. Saltwater intrusion is already causing abandonment of coastal groundwater wells.</p>
        <p>With the increased frequency of droughts because of climate change, there is need for an integrated approach to use available best practises for water generation, water capture, distribution, storage, and reuse, while respecting the natural balance of water needs for the forest and natural ecosystem systems and sectors such as farming. The project is to ensure consistent water supply for the people of Antigua and Barbuda.</p>
