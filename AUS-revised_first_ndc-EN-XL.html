      <h2>I. Australia’s strengthened climate ambition</h2>
      <p>This submission communicates Australia’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
      <p>In this updated NDC, Australia is increasing the ambition of its 2030 target, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
      <p>Australia also reaffirms its target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Both targets are economy-wide emissions reduction commitments, covering all sectors and gases included in Australia’s national inventory.</p>
      <p>Australia’s new 2030 target is a significant increase in ambition. It is a 15 percentage point increase on the upper end of the previous 2030 target of 26 – 28% below 2005 levels – or half as much again as the previous target. The revised 2030 commitment is both a single-year target to reduce emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030 and a multi-year emissions budget from 2021-2030.</p>
      <p>The updated 2030 target puts Australia on track to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.</p>
      <p>It reflects the Australian Government’s resolve to urgently step up action and work alongside global partners to tackle the climate crisis, achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and keep 1.5°C within reach. Our aspiration is that the commitments of our industry, states and territories and the Australian people will yield even greater emissions reductions in the coming decade.</p>
      <p>Australia will not carry over any overachievement on its 2020 target or its Kyoto Protocol targets to meet its Paris Agreement targets.</p>
      <p>The Australian Government is implementing a substantial and rigorous suite of new policies across the economy to drive the transition to net zero. Australia’s new 2030 target is based on the modelled impact of these policies. The Australian Government is working to urgently implement these policies to maximise their emissions reduction impact and economic benefits and to provide Australian industry with a comprehensive and consistent policy framework. Australia’s new policies include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A $20 billion investment in Australia’s electricity grid to unlock greater penetration of renewable energy and accelerate decarbonisation of the grid.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Complemented by an additional $300 million to deliver community batteries and solar banks across Australia.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>
          <p>Investment of up to $3 billion from the new National Reconstruction Fund to support renewables manufacturing and the deployment of low emissions technologies, broadening Australia’s industrial base, bolstering regional economic development, and boosting private investment in abatement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A Powering the Regions Fund to support the development of new clean energy industries and the decarbonisation priorities of existing industry.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The Fund will also prioritise building the workforce skills and capability required for the clean energy transition. The Australian Government will invest a further $100 million to train 10,000 New Energy Apprentices in the jobs of the future and establish a $10 million New Energy Skills Program to provide additional training pathways.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The introduction of declining emissions baselines for Australia’s major emitters, under the existing Safeguard Mechanism, providing a predictable policy framework for industry, consistent with a national trajectory to net zero and supporting international competitiveness.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Australia’s first National Electric Vehicle Strategy, to reduce emissions and accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles, including by establishing a new Driving the Nation Fund and doubling the Commonwealth’s investment in charging and refuelling infrastructure to $500 million. The Australian Government will also introduce an electric car tax discount and establish a real-world emissions testing program to help consumers make more informed choices about the fuel efficiency of their vehicles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The application of new standardised and internationally-aligned reporting requirements for climate risks and opportunities for large businesses.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A commitment to reduce the emissions of Commonwealth Government agencies to net zero by 2030 (excluding defence and security agencies).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
          <p>These new measures will build on existing emissions reduction and low emissions technology accelerator policies and programs including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, crediting under the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011, and a range of investments to accelerate and facilitate low emissions and clean energy technologies, such as green hydrogen, energy storage, and low emissions steel and aluminium, to bring their costs down to make them competitive with higher emitting alternatives.</p>
          <p>The Australian Government will introduce a new annual statement to Parliament on climate policy, progress against national targets and international developments and will seek to formalise its targets in legislation. The annual statement and other climate policy will be informed by Australia’s Climate Change Authority, which the Government will restore as an independent source of advice.</p>
          <p>Australia is committed to working closely with our Pacific family to achieve an ambitious international response to the climate crisis, including talking with them about jointly hosting a future UNFCCC Conference of the Parties meeting.</p>
          <p>As a federation, Australian States, Territories and local government also implement significant policies and programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support clean energy technologies. Australian households, communities and businesses are increasingly playing their part in addressing climate change and embracing the opportunities presented by the transition to net zero.</p>
          <p>The details of Australia’s new 2030 target, and its 2050 net zero target are provided in Table 1. Australia will track progress towards both targets in its Biennial Transparency Reports under the Paris Agreement, on the basis of national emissions reported in its annual National Inventory Report. Australia will also provide detailed information on each of its policies and measures in its Biennial Transparency Reports.</p>
      <h2>II. Australia’s action to advance adaptation and resilience</h2>
  <p>Climate change is already having significant impacts in Australia and our region. The Australian Government is taking concerted action to adapt to climate change and ensure the resilience and disaster readiness of our communities and natural environment in the context of its impacts.</p>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Leading the development of an urgent climate risk assessment of the implications of climate change for national security, which will be an enduring feature of Australia’s climate action.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Making sure Australia is disaster ready by spending up to $200 million every year on disaster preparation and resilience projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Protecting Australia’s unique environment by fixing Australia’s urban rivers and catchments, and doubling the number of Indigenous Rangers, recognising the importance of employing Indigenous People’s knowledge and experience to address the climate crisis.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Investing in the health and resilience of our ocean ecosystems, including by strengthening the management of our national network of Marine Parks and spending an additional $194.5 million on top of existing investments to protect the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Establishing a Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, so that climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as the climate and biodiversity crises, can be addressed holistically.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Australia looks forward to making even stronger contributions to global climate science and sharing our expertise, experiences and skills across the globe toward stronger adaptation and resilience outcomes.</p>

The Australian Government will support and partner with communities and industry on decarbonisation priorities, the development of new clean energy industries and skills and training programs to support workforce development. This will ensure that Australia is well-positioned to capitalise on clean economy opportunities to drive growth and support job creation.</p>
        <p>The Australian Government has committed to reduce the emissions of Commonwealth Government agencies to net zero emissions by 2030 (excluding defence and security agencies). Emissions reductions across non-Defence (Australian Public Service) agencies is a strong commitment to lead by example on emissions reductions and contribute to the decarbonisation of Australia’s economy.</p>
        <p>The Australian Government will also improve integrity in decision-making around climate change with a new annual statement to Parliament as a matter of transparency and accountability.
