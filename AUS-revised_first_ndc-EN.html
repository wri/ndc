      <h2>I. Australia’s commitments</h2>
      <p>By this submission, Australia communicates its updated and enhanced first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Australia adopts a target of net zero emissions by 2050.</strong> This is an economy-wide target, covering all sectors and gases included in Australia’s national inventory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In order to achieve net zero by 2050, <strong>Australia commits to seven low emissions technology stretch goals</strong> - ambitious but realistic goals to bring priority low emissions technologies to economic parity with existing mature technologies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Australia reaffirms its ambitious economy-wide target</strong> to reduce greenhouse emissions to by 26 - 28% below 2005 levels by 2030, and will exceed it by up to 9 percentage points. Australia’s emissions projections 2021 demonstrate that we are on track to reduce emissions by up to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        </li>
        </ul>
          <p>The details of Australia’s 2030 and 2050 targets and low emissions stretch goals are set out in Tables 1–3, along with the information for clarity, transparency and understanding in accordance with decision 4/CMA.1 (see Table 4).</p>
          <p>Emissions reduction targets must go hand-in-hand with real outcomes. Australia has a strong track record of setting emissions reduction targets that are both ambitious and achievable, and of holding ourselves accountable for exceeding them. Australia met and exceeded its first and second commitment period targets under the Kyoto Protocol and its 2020 target under the Convention. We are on track to overachieve against our 2030 target.</p>
          <p><strong>Australia’s performance against its 2030 target, and our commitment to our low emissions technology economic stretch goals place us on a trajectory to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Australia has a Long Term Emissions Reduction Plan which details how we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050</strong>.</p>
          <p>Projected emissions are lower than all previous projections, and Australia has outperformed all previous projections. Since 2018, Australia’s forecast position against the 2030 target has improved by 843 Mt CO₂-e, equivalent to taking all of Australia’s 14.9 million passenger vehicles off the road for more than 19 years.</p>
          <p>The improvement in the 2021 emissions projections reflects the impact of:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>$1.6 billion in new technology-focused emissions reduction measures in the Australian Government’s 2021–22 Budget</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Australia’s world leading uptake of renewables</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>the latest forecasts, including on energy consumption.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Australia’s emissions have fallen faster than every previous forecast, 2005–2030</h2>
      <p><img width="410" height="237" alt="image" src="img/AUS-NDC1-1.png"/></p>
      <p>Australia’s pathway to net zero is summarized in Section II of this communication and detailed in Australia’s whole of economy Long Term Emissions Reduction Plan.</p>
      <p>Comprehensive modelling and analysis has been undertaken to inform Australia’s whole of economy Long Term Emissions Reduction Plan. The scenarios examined through this modelling illustrate that getting new energy technologies to parity with existing higher emissions alternatives will bring net zero within reach.</p>
      <p>Australia will close any remaining gap to net zero consistent with the principles set out in the Plan, and will conduct five yearly ‘review and refine’ cycles to take stock of progress towards net zero, ensuring our policies are calibrated to ensure its achievement, including by identifying additional emission reduction opportunities, reflecting the latest technology advances, international developments, and other factors.</p>
      <p>Australia will also conduct regular reviews of the impacts of our policies on our regions, energy prices, jobs and other economic indicators. Under the Technology Investment Roadmap, Australia will also report annually on progress towards the technology stretch goals and the investments the Government is making to support their achievement.</p>

      <p>The details of Australia’s 2050 target are provided in Table 1. Australia will track progress towards net zero emissions in its Biennial Transparency Reports under the Paris Agreement, on the basis of national emissions reported in its National Inventory Document.</p>
      <p>Section III of this communication provides a summary of Australia’s low emissions technology stretch goals and the Government’s approach to supporting their achievement. Achieving these goals is fundamental to reaching net zero emissions across the economy. Full details are set out in the Government’s Low Emissions Technology Statement 2021 (LETS 2021).</p>
      <h2>II. Australia’s plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050</h2>
      <p>Australia’s whole-of-economy Long Term Emissions Reduction Plan is our plan for achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and positioning our economy to seize the opportunities of the global shift to lower emissions. The Plan is focused on ‘the how’, on practical action to convert ambition into achievement, because a target without a Plan is meaningless.</p>
      <p>Australia’s plan has the wellbeing and prosperity of Australia’s regional communities at its core. It recognises that trends in technology and consumer preferences will drive a global shift towards low emissions energy sources and new energy technologies. The Government will partner with Australian communities and businesses to provide the support they need to benefit from these shifts by capturing new markets and economic opportunities.</p>
      <p>Five core principles guided the development of our Plan and Australia’s suite of emissions reduction policies. Taken together, these principles will ensure Australia’s shift to a net zero emissions economy will be effective, fair and equitable, and that no sector of the economy will carry a disproportionate burden.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>We will deploy technology not taxes. Our focus is on reducing the cost of low emissions energy sources, not raising the cost of existing approaches. Our approach will not impose new costs on households or businesses, enabling Australia to achieve our emissions reduction targets while growing our economy and jobs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Government will expand choices, not mandates, recognising that widespread deployment of mature technologies will be led by the private sector with an enabling role for government, as households and businesses adopt new technologies where it makes sense for them to do so.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Achieving the global Paris goals requires transformative technologies to be deployed at scale across all sectors of the economy. Our priority must be to drive down the cost of a range of technologies to bring them to commercial parity. This is the objective of Australia’s Technology Investment Roadmap.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We will protect the competitiveness of our businesses and industries, and the livelihoods of Australians and keep energy prices down with affordable and reliable power.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Transparency is essential to convert ambition into achievement. Australia will be accountable for progress under our Plan, setting the global benchmark for transparency and accountability in our emissions reporting. Globally, Australia will continue to advocate for all major economies to be held to the same high standards of transparency.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
          <p>The plan focuses not only on reducing our own emissions, but also on how Australia will play a leadership role in meeting the Paris Agreement goals through our low emissions energy exports and contributions to innovation. Importantly, Australia will continue supplying the energy exports in demand in the global economy so long as they are needed to support the economies of our trading partners. Through these efforts, we will partner with countries in our region to ensure access to the technologies, finance and clean, affordable energy needed to transition their economies and achieve their broader development goals.</p>
          <p>This recognizes that global pathways to achieving the Paris goals must also deliver the economic development needs and aspirations of many countries. A technology-led approach is the only viable and realistic way to balance these objectives. Australia is embracing this leadership role because a renewed global effort is needed to develop low emissions technologies so they are globally accessible, affordable and scalable.</p>
          <p>Australia’s Plan has been informed by detailed modelling and analysis of potential impacts on our economy, with a particular focus on the importance of low cost, clean technologies. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will depend on our success in reducing the costs of low emissions technologies and accelerating their deployment at scale across all sectors.</p>
          <p>Australia’s policies are focused on the technologies that can open these critical pathways.</p>
          <p>A portfolio of technologies will be needed, including cross-cutting ‘platform’ technologies (like hydrogen) and technologies tailored to specific and niche applications within individual sectors.</p>
          <p>By investing in research, development and demonstration, the government will, in partnership with the private sector, drive down the cost of these key technologies and achieve their economic stretch goals, unlocking their use across the economy. The Technology Investment Roadmap is the cornerstone of this approach.</p>
      <h2>III. Low emissions technology stretch goals</h2>
  <p>The Australian Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap establishes an enduring process to accelerate the development and commercialisation of new and emerging low emissions technologies. The aim is to drive priority technologies to cost parity with higher emissions alternatives.</p>
  <p>Priority low emissions technologies and accompanying economic stretch goals are identified in annual Low Emissions Technology Statements. Economic stretch goals are ambitious but realistic goals representing the point at which each priority technology will become cost competitive with existing higher emitting technologies, leading to adoption at large scale across the economy, significantly reducing emissions without additional costs. Australia is committed to achieving the seven economic stretch goals, and will track progress towards them in each Biennial Transparency Report on the basis described in table 2 below, informed by an impact evaluation framework. Meeting the economic stretch goals will result in significant emission reductions. Accelerated deployment of the priority technologies and enabling infrastructure takes us about 40 per cent of the way to net zero emissions.</p>
  <p>These technologies will also underpin further emissions reductions in Australia resulting from global low emissions technology trends, like electric vehicles powered by zero emissions electricity. These global trends are estimated to contribute up to a further third of the required emissions reductions for Australia to reach net zero emissions.</p>
  <p>These technologies are also important for addressing emissions internationally. They address emissions in sectors that account for 90 per cent of global emissions, or around 45 billion tonnes CO2-e annually.</p>

  <p><strong>The Australian government will invest at least $20 billion in low emissions technologies by 2030, to drive over $80 billion of total public and private investment over the decade.</strong> This investment will support 160,000 new jobs across Australia.</p>
  <p>The Australian Government is continuing to leverage investment in clean and low emissions energy through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), which is the world’s largest government owned green bank, and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). Through ARENA and CEFC, Australia has already mobilized over $10.8 billion in funding to support projects with a total value of almost $38 billion.</p>
  <p>The new commitments contained in this 2021 communication are additional to the ambition communicated in Australia’s 2015 and 2020 NDC communications. This communication should be read alongside the commitments contained in Australia’s 2020 communication, which set out an update on newly announced policies and measures, and provides a snapshot of progress on policies and measures outlined in the 2015 NDC communication, including Australia’s commitment to transparency and to advancing adaptation and resilience.</p>
  <h2>Australia’s action to advance adaptation and resilience</h2>
  <p>Australia has a strong history of investing and taking action on climate adaptation to build resilience and adapt both at home and in our region. Historically over 70 percent of Australia’s bilateral and regional climate finance is focused on climate resilience and adaptation, reflecting key priorities for our region.</p>
  <p>Australia’s new National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy sets out what the Australian Government will do to support efforts across all levels of government, business and the community, to better anticipate, manage and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Strategy sets out three interlinked objectives to ensure Australians can better protect our natural assets, build community resilience and generate economic opportunities. The Strategy also sets the path to deeper cooperation with our Indo-Pacific and international partners, and the global community. By working together, we can share our expertise and experience to better target our investments and the maximise benefits.</p>
  <p>Australia has delivered the adaptation communication committed to in our 2020 NDC. Australia’s adaptation communication showcases our ongoing action and progress to the UNFCCC. Australia’s adaptation action is built on partnerships. Australia will continue to make strong contributions to global climate science and sharing our expertise, experiences and skills across the globe toward stronger adaptation and resilience outcomes.</p>

        <p>Details for each priority technology economic stretch goal below.</p>
        <p>Clean hydrogen: The A$2 per kilogram stretch goal is based on the average cost of clean hydrogen at the site of production. Clean hydrogen includes hydrogen produced via electrolysis using renewable energy, hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with substantial CCS and all other clean hydrogen methods of production, including pyrolysis or other emerging production methods (i.e. bioenergy). Australia notes that clean hydrogen production under $2 per kg requires clean electricity at around $20 per MWh, however to increase Australia’s competitiveness in hydrogen exports, production costs closer to $1 per kg will ultimately be required, necessitating lower electricity costs. The target timeframe reflects two different deployment pathways. Deployment of hydrogen production from steam methane reforming with CCS in Australia is subject to securing low cost gas, offtake agreements and development approvals. Should these be secured, the clean hydrogen stretch goal could be met as early as 2025–2030. Under the other deployment pathway, steep reductions in the costs of renewable electricity and electrolysis could make the stretch goal feasible between 2028–2035 (for production of clean hydrogen with electrolysis). Annual low emissions technology statements and State of Hydrogen reports will track progress against this cost goal.</p>
        <p>Ultra-low cost solar: The $15/MWh stretch goal for ultra-low cost solar has been set taking into consideration current and projected cost of utility scale solar electricity, and alignment with international benchmarks. The stretch goal assumes utility scale solar PV without network or firming costs, and without subsidies. Other assumptions include: 25% capacity factor, 5.9%WACC, and 25 year operating life. The target timeframe provided is based on utility scale solar technology. Note that the timeframe for achieving the ultralow-cost solar stretch goal does not yet underpin the electricity price assumptions used for achieving clean hydrogen, energy storage, and low emissions steel and aluminum stretch goals.</p>
        <p>Energy Storage: The electricity from storage for firming stretch goal – under $100/MWh – is consistent with an average wholesale electricity price under</p>
        <p>$70/MWh and represents the cost at which low emissions electricity, available on demand for eight hours or more, will be competitive with conventional mid- merit gas generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM). AEMO’s 2019 Wholesale Electricity Market: Electricity Statement of Opportunities (page 18) defines ‘mid-merit capacity’ as Scheduled Generators that operate between 10% and 70% of the time. The stretch goal represents the capacity cost plus the short run marginal cost of mid-merit generation. Input price assumptions for electricity prices were based on CSIRO GenCost report 2019–20. Commodity forecasts and activity levels informed by a number of publications and data from government agencies and other bodies, including: the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Energy and Resources, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).</p>
        <p>Low emissions steel: The $700 per tonne stretch goal is based on bottom up analysis of current production costs for steel and an assumed profit margin. The figure reflects marginal costs and excludes capital costs. Significant changes in raw material costs may require the stretch goal to be updated over time. While the stretch goal is focused on steel production, the Government recognizes there are opportunities to apply low emissions technologies to upstream processes such as iron ore mining and beneficiation. The high uptake scenario for low emissions steel produced with hydrogen and direct iron reduction could be economically viable as early as 2030, but subject to capital development cycles.</p>
        <p>Low emissions aluminium: The $2,200 per tonne stretch goal is based on bottom up analysis of current production costs for aluminium and an assumed profit margin. The figure reflects marginal costs and excludes capital costs. Significant changes in raw material costs may require the stretch goals to be updated over time. While the stretch goal focuses on aluminium production, the Government recognises there are opportunities to apply low emissions technologies to upstream processes such as bauxite mining and alumina refining. In a high technology scenario, with cheap firmed renewable electricity and deployment of inert anodes, low emissions aluminium production could be cost competitive on a marginal cost basis with current aluminium production methods as soon as 2035. This would be driven by substantial cost reductions in firmed renewable electricity.</p>
        <p>Carbon capture and storage: The $20 per tonne of CO₂ stretch goal covers CO2 compression, hub transport and storage, but does not cover capture processes, noting the cost of capture technologies varies between applications and depends on factors such as the relative concentration of CO2 for different industrial processes. The stretch goal assumes CO₂ is transported within a hub distance of less than 100 km to suitable reservoirs. Achieving a stretch goal of under $20 per tonne would position CCS to be competitive over the long term with other forms of abatement supported by Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund. Under a high technology scenario, CCS could be deployed as early as 2025, subject to securing offtake agreements and development approvals.</p>
        <p>Soil carbon measurement: The soil carbon measurement stretch goal time range was set based on consultations with industry. Based on a high technology uptake scenario, advancements in proximal sensing, simulation modelling and remote sensing technologies could see the stretch goal of under $3 per hectare per year reached as early as 2025. As of 2020, soil carbon measurement for Emissions Reduction Fund projects were estimated at around $30 per hectare per year (CSIRO estimates based on a land area of 300 hectares; estimates could be lower for larger areas).</p>

        <p>Australia’s Nationally Determined Contribution is an ambitious, fair and responsible contribution to global efforts toward meeting the objective of the UNFCCC and the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>Australia’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 represents significant ambition for Australia. This target is underpinned by robust policies which will maximize abatement both in Australia, and globally, to ensure Australia and our partners can meet this timeframe, while ensuring continued economic growth, prosperity and secure and reliable energy systems.</p>
        <p>Australia’s 2030 target is an important benchmark towards achieving net zero by 2050. Australia’s 2030 target represents a halving of emissions per person in Australia, or 74% reduction in emissions per unit of GDP. Australia’s 2021 emissions projections show Australia will more than halve emissions per person and achieve a 77–81% reduction in emissions per unit of GDP by 2030. The target represents serious and ambitious effort for Australia and takes account of Australia’s unique national circumstances, including a growing population and our role as a leading global resources and agricultural commodities provider.</p>
        <p>The target is a floor on Australia’s 2030 ambition. We intend to overachieve on this target and newly released emissions projections show Australia is on track to meet and beat our 2030 target without relying on past overachievement.</p>
        <p>In addition to this target, Australia’s low emissions technology economic stretch goals are ambitious but realistic goals to bring priority low emissions technologies to economic parity with existing high emissions technologies.</p>
        <p>Achieving these priority low emissions technology stretch goals will maximize abatement potential for Australia and our partners. These technologies have been specifically identified as those which have the highest abatement and economic potential in areas of comparative advantage for Australia. Accelerated deployment of the 6 priority technologies and enabling infrastructure could</p>
        <p>contribute over 230 million tonnes CO₂-e in annual emissions reductions in Australia by 2040, compared to 2020 levels. This represents approximately 45% of Australia’s total emissions in 2020.</p>
        <p>These priority low emissions technologies will offer emissions reduction opportunities across Australia’s economic sectors, with sequestration technologies providing additional decarbonisation pathways for key industries, while protecting and preserving jobs. These benefits will resonate globally and have a profound impact on global technology readiness, assisting our partners in also achieving their climate goals.</p>
        <p>The timeframes for achieving these economic stretch goals assume a ‘high technology uptake scenario’ driven by public investments and policies that reduce risk for private investors, a shift in consumer preferences towards low emissions supply chains, and private investments consistent with an the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>These commitments represent serious and ambitious effort for Australia. This effort takes account of Australia’s unique national circumstances, including a growing population and economy, role as a leading global resources and agricultural commodities provider, our current energy infrastructure, and higher than average abatement costs. The target places Australia on a stable pathway towards longer term emissions reductions in the context of future global action and technological innovation.</p>

The government will support and partner with communities and businesses to capture new markets and help manage the transition.</p>
        <p>Australia’s plan focuses not only on reducing our own emissions, but also on how Australia will support the transition pathways of partner countries, through our low emissions energy exports and contributions to innovation, and the development of low emissions technologies. Australia will continue to supply energy exports that our trading partners need to maintain their economic prosperity.</p>

        <p>Achievement of Australia’s priority technology stretch goals will have a significant impact on global emissions. The five technologies first identified in Australia’s first low emissions technology statement (2020) (hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions materials, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon measurement) address emissions in sectors that account for 90 per cent of global emissions, or around 45 billion tonnes CO2-e annually. Australia is targeting international partnerships that support these economic stretch goals, including access to global markets and more competitive supply chains. We are also prioritising partnerships that focus on critical research, development and deployment challenges for economically important, hard-to-abate sectors.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal of Australia’s Technology Investment Roadmap is the substitution of existing higher emission technologies and practices with cleaner, more efficient and lower cost technologies. Getting these priority technologies to cost parity with existing mature technologies will help to make net zero emissions achievable and affordable for all countries.</p>

        <p>The Commonwealth Government of Australia is responsible for policy making at national level, responsibilities are shared amongst government departments in accordance with Ministerial portfolio’s and responsibilities. At the time of submission of this communication, the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources is responsible for climate mitigation policies, including national inventory, accounting and projections; the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is responsible for climate science and climate adaptation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for international climate change negotiations.</p>
        <p>When first announcing Australia’s 2030 target in 2015, the Australian Government committed to review its climate change policies. In 2017 the Australian Government reviewed its climate change policies to ensure they remain effective in achieving Australia’s 2030 target and Paris Agreement commitments. A final report was released on 19 December 2017. The aim of the review was to ensure Australia’s policies remain effective in achieving Australia’s 2030 target and Paris Agreement commitments.</p>
        <p>Australia will also refine our whole of economy Long Term Emission Reduction Plan and progress towards net zero by 2050 through these five yearly ‘review and refine’ cycles. Australia will conduct its next five yearly review process in the first half of 2024. This will inform the development of our next NDC, due to be submitted in 2025. The Government will consult widely through this process, especially with industry and regional communities.</p>
        <p>These reviews will leverage Australia’s world-class emissions measurement and reporting systems so we can monitor and evaluate the progress by each sector in reducing emissions. It will also draw on the evaluation frameworks embedded in other initiatives. In particular, the 2021 LETS outlined a comprehensive impact evaluation framework for annually evaluating our progress in achieving the economic stretch goals for priority technologies and driving technology deployment.</p>
        <p>The five yearly review process will allow Australia to take stock of our progress towards our net zero target. This will ensure our policies are calibrated to reflect the latest technology advances, international developments and other factors. It will ensure there is transparency regarding how progress is tracked, including any updates or revisions, achievements and effectiveness of key national policies and investments, as well as the role of state and territory policies and targets in contributing to the national goal. It will enable Australia to balance its investments across domestic offsets, international offsets and pursuing technological breakthroughs).</p>
        <p>The 2017 review looked at the opportunities and challenges of reducing emissions on a sector by sector basis, taking into consideration the different circumstances and characteristics of each sector. The review considered recommendations from the Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market. The then Australian Department of the Environment and Energy consulted widely with businesses across all sectors of the economy and with the community. This included the release of a discussion paper on 24 March 2017, which generated 357 public submissions (105 from individuals and 252 from organisations). Senior Executives of the Department of the Environment and Energy</a> met with more than 270 stakeholders and the Minister for the Environment and Energy hosted two roundtables, attended by representatives of 42 business, community, environmental and Indigenous organisations. The final report is accessible at the following link: <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020–08/2017-review-of-climate-change-policies.pdf.">https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020–08/2017-review-of-climate-change-policies.pdf.</a></p>
        <p>Australia has continued to improve and refine its emissions reduction policies. The King Review was commissioned in 2019 to examine how Australia could build on the ERF to unlock additional sources of abatement. While the ERF has been very successful in driving abatement from the land sector, the King Review recommended improvements to the ERF and a greater focus on voluntary action and technology to achieve abatement from a broader range of sources.</p>
        <p>Co-design of new and expanded methods (including for CCS) and reducing transaction costs for participants will create more opportunities to participate in the ERF. As part of its response to the King Review, the Government is implementing a below-baseline crediting mechanism under the Safeguard Mechanism. This will create more opportunities to drive abatement, especially in the industrial sector.</p>
        <p>As observed by the King Review and confirmed in analytical work for this plan, achieving deep emissions reductions in the future will require an approach that enables emissions reductions by all sectors. Australia’s technology-led approach is designed to achieve this.</p>

        <p>Australia’s per capita emissions have been declining over the past two decades while the population and economy have grown. Australia’s national circumstances shape its response to climate change. Australia’s vast size, diverse landscapes, predisposition to climate variability, resource based economy and small but growing population living mostly in coastal regions pose challenges and opportunities to managing the impacts of climate change.</p>
        <p>Australia is one of the world’s largest energy exporters, generating almost three times the volume of national consumption and exporting excess production. Eighty-five percent of the energy we produce is exported. We are among the world’s largest exporters of coal and LNG. We also have the world’s largest reserves of uranium and close to the best solar resources, in the world. Australia has a large agricultural sector, producing food for domestic consumption as well as export.</p>
        <p>Australia’s large resource and agricultural production, and dependence on long-haul transport have led to relatively high, but declining, per capita emissions compared to other developed countries.</p>
        <p>These declines are, in large part, a result of government policies, at the Federal, State and Territory and local levels,, an overall decline in land clearing emissions, and structural changes in Australia’s economy including a move away from manufacturing and other heavy industrial activities.</p>
        <p>Australia is transforming its electricity market, from a 20th century electricity grid dominated by large scale, fossil fuel-fired generators to a 21st century grid with increasing penetration of renewables, storage and demand management technologies. The Government’s climate and energy policies to are ensuring the successful transition of the electricity market providing reliable, affordable energy whilereducing emissions.</p>
