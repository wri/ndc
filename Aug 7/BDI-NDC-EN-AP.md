# REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI 

## INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (INDC) / BURUNDI 
September 2015 

### 1. NATIONAL CONTEXT 

 
Burundi is a landlocked country at the heart of Africa's Great Lakes Region, located between the meridians 29°00'-30°25 East and parallels 2°20°-4°25' South. It has an area of 27,834 km² and belongs to two major river basins: the NileBasin, accounting for 13,800 km² of the country's territory, and the CongoBasin, covering 14,034 km². Its mostly rural population, with an urbanization rate of around 10.4%, was estimated at 8,053,574 at the time of the 2008 census, with an average density of 310 inhabitants/km². 

The Burundian economy is dominated by the primary sector, which accounts for nearly half of its gross domestic product (GDP) and close to 80% of its export income; the secondary sector (industry and handicraft) represents just 17-18% of GDP, and the tertiary sector, only about one third of GDP. The current production structure, dominated by subsistence farming, makes the economy very vulnerable and fragile due to its dependency on climate conditions. 

Electrical power consumption in Burundi, amounting to 25 kWh/person/year, represents just 4% of the energy balance. 

In Burundi, activities relating to climate change were marked in particular by the development and publication of the first and second national communications under the UNFCCC. At the same time, Burundi also prepared its National Adaptation Programme of Action to climate change (NAPA). The actions identified in the NAPA covered the key sectors of the Burundian economy. As various sectoral adaptation and vulnerability assessment studies have shown, climate change affects every sector of the country's economy, particularly agriculture. 

The prospects for sustainable ecological growth were defined through Burundi Vision 2025 and translated into a short term action plan as part of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework covering the period of 2012-2015. In the medium to long term, the Government plans to engage in a transition toward a green economy. Burundi Vision 2025 makes a firm commitment to prioritizing the country's protection and rational management of the environment such that Burundians can live in a protected, properly managed setting. 

The Government has stated its**vision** of the fight against climate change as follows: "***A State that promotes development that is resilient to the harmful effects of climate change***". 

At the institutional level, the Ministry of Water, the Environment, Land Management and Urban Planning, with its departments and personalized institutionssuch asIGEBU and OBPE, handles matters relating to climate change. For the fulfilment of its mission, the Ministry enjoys the support of frameworks for dialogue such as the National Environment Commission, the Sectoral Group on Water, Sanitation and the Environment (GSEAE), the National Water Partnership (PNE-Bu), and the National Platform for Risk Prevention and Disaster Management. 

In the framework of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), Burundi intends to reaffirm its determination to contribute to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to strengthen its resilience to climate change while continuing to meet its own development challenges. 

### 2. ADAPTATION 

#### 2.1. Climate change impacts and vulnerability 

Studies conducted for the initial national communication on climate change and the evolution of climate parameters in Burundi through 2050, based on the general circulation model, show that the average annual temperature will increase by 1°C to 3°C. Rainfall will rise by roughly 10%, and the precipitation regime will be disrupted such that there will only be two seasons remaining, each lasting six months: a rainy season from November to April, followed by a dry season. 

These climate changes will engender a large number of risks associated with the following phenomena: (i) season creep; (ii) flooding of swamps and lowlands; (iii) land degradation and loss of soil fertility; (iv) shortage of groundwater resources; (v) extreme weather events (hail, violent showers, heavy winds, etc.); (vi) changes to the growing seasons of crops and forests; and (vii) unpredictable movements of pests. 

According to an integrated analysis of Burundi's vulnerability, conducted as part of the ACCES (Climate Change Adaptation for Soil and Water Resources Conservation) Project, it was found that the country's "hotspots of vulnerability" are located in the north and northwest. The slope of the ridge (and not the ridge itself) leading to the Imbo Plain to the west, the topographical structures to the north and the central plateau are the regions most vulnerable to erosion. The main causes are the highly variable relief and the pronounced sensitivity of those regions to climate variability. 

 

Table 1: Major impacts relating to climate change in Burundi (Source: NAPA 2007) 
| Sector | Impacts |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Water | -Drying up of lakes and other waterways, and disappearance of aquatic flora  -Deterioration of surface water quality  -Increased rainwater erosion and silting of certain rivers  -Decline in production by hydroelectric power plants  -Increased competition for the use of unpolluted groundwater resources |
| Energy | -More frequent shutdowns of certain active hydroelectric power plants because of exceeding operating thresholds due to insufficient rainfall and prolonged drought  -Complete silting of certain dams due to heightened erosion caused by more abundant precipitation leading to the complete shutdown of a few hydroelectric power plants, the most endangered among them being the Marangara, Buhiga and Kayenzi plants  -More frequent flooding of electricity production infrastructure like in Mugere, leading to production shutdowns for longer periods of time  -Increased runoff from land degradation in the hydroelectric power plants’ watersheds  -Major fluctuations in electricity production due to stresses on the water supply system and changes in rainfall patterns  -A larger deficit in the electricity sector leading to real electrical power supply problems in the country’s various socioeconomic domains  -Widespread scarcity of firewood and wood charcoal due to heightened, combined pressure from human activities, rising temperatures and changes to biomass growth rates |
| Agriculture and livestock farming | -Declines in harvests, cattle, goats, sheep and poultry aggravated by more prolonged, more frequent drought with likelihoods of occurrence of between 40% and 60% -Meat and dairy production yields will be even more heavily affected and reduced, along with fish production in the event of drought  -Lightning appearing during tornadoes will increase, causing additional livestock deaths in mountainous areas  -Decline in the quality and quantity of pastureland  |
| Health | -Increased number of cases of malaria |
| Landscapes | -Risk of more frequent, larger scale flooding of lowlands  Escalation of soil erosion along groundwater trenches in the watersheds of the MirwaMountains  -The levels of Lakes Cohoha, Rweru, Rwihinda and Kanzigiri in the Bugesera Depression could further decrease with the intensification of drought, with their waters retreating at above 400 m, which has already been seen toward the centres of those lakes and puts some of the shallower ones at risk of completely disappearing  -The level of Lake Tanganyika will rise due to heavy precipitation |
| Terrestrial ecosystems (forests) | -Disappearance of the subalpine zone starting at an elevation of 2,450 m  -Disappearance of certain plant species and aggravation of erosion and bush fires  -Degradation of the groves in Bugesera and forests of Hyphaene palm trees on the Ruzizi Plain, with an increased vulnerability to bush fires |

 
### 2.2. Adaptation needs 

To reduce Burundi's vulnerability and boost its resilience, the country's needs have been identified. These relate to human, institutional, technical and financial capacity- building, as well as technology transfers. 

#### a)  Human and institutional capacity-building needs 

The country needs to: 

- Inform, educate and communicate about the climate, climate risks and adaptation technologies (development of the population's reactivity); 
-  Strengthen the aptitudes of actors (especially women and farmers) in new technical processes, in the interest of intensified, sustainable production methods (new crop systems and techniques); 
-  Encourage  technology  transfers  between  research  institutes  and  agro-sylvo-pastoral actors; 
-  Support institutions in defining adaptation priorities by socioeconomic sector and foster inter-sectoral consistency, namely during the development of the National Adaptation Plan. 


b)  Technical and technology transfer needs

### 3. MITIGATION  

In terms of mitigation, the desired INDC for Burundi should make it possible to meet the sustainability objectives defined in national policies and strategies. 

 |  |  | Expected rate of reduction |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type of contribution | Unconditional contribution | Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 3% compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for 2030 |
|  | Conditional contribution | Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, beginning in 2016, compared to the business-as-usual scenario for 2030 |
| Baseline year |  | 2005 |
| Target year |  | 2030 |
| Total reduction in emissions by 2030 |  | 1,958 Gg CO2e for the unconditional objective and 14,897 Gg CO2e for the conditional objective |

#### 3.1. Business-as-usual scenario and emissions reduction objectives 

The table below presents the emissions for the baseline year and the business-as- usual (BAU) scenario, the emissions for the unconditional objective and the emissions for the conditional objective, whose implementation will depend on the financial support of the international community. 

##### a)  Unconditional objective 

Under the National Reforestation Programme, Burundi has undertaken to increase its carbon dioxide gas well through 4,000 hectares of annual reforestation over the course of 15 years, beginning in 2016. 

In the *energy sector*, Burundi is in the process of building three hydroelectric power plants. This programme will increase the country's electrification rate to 35%. 

##### b)  Conditional objective 

- *Forestry:*(i) reforestation of 8,000 ha/year during 15 years, beginning in 2016; (ii) replacement of 100% of traditional charcoal kilns and traditional home ovens by 2030; 
- *Agriculture:* gradual replacement of 100% of mineral fertilizers with organic fertilizer by 2030.

#### 3.2. Scope and scale of the contribution 

Table 4: Scope and scale of the contribution 
| Sector | Gas(es) | Sub-sector(s) | Geographic scope |
|-------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Energy | CO2, CH4 and N2O | Fuel combustion activities | Nationwide |
| Agriculture & livestock | CH4 and N2O | Agricultural soils | Nationwide |
| Land use and forestry | CO2 | Forestland | Nationwide |

#### 3.3. Assumptions and methodology 
The choice of assumptions is guided by the development planning orientations defined in Burundi Vision 2025 and the national operationalization policies and strategies for the Vision. 

The GHG inventories were performed on five modules identified by the IPCC: Industrial Processes, Energy, Agriculture, Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), as well as the Waste module. 

100 years of GWP values were used for the conversion to CO2 equivalents (IPCC Assessment Report). These numbers were 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O. 

The policy documents thattake GHG emissions generating activities into consideration - and that were used to formulate the assumptions and objectives - appear in Table 5.

#### 3.4. Emissions compensation 
In terms of compensation for any loss of revenue or for the restriction of certain economic activities due to the implementation of the INDC programme, Burundi will rely on international greenhouse gas emissions compensation mechanisms and on current national legislation. 

In terms of forestry in particular, the plan is to promote the development of ecosystem services. 

#### 3.5. Verification/counting methods 

Concerning  carbon  counting  and  verification  methods,  Burundi  will  conform  to  the IPCC's guidelines. 

#### 3.6. Ambitious, equitable nature of the planned contribution 
Limiting the rise in GHG emissions presents a major challenge for Burundi, in view of its national context. Economically, Burundi is ranked a least developed country (LDC), with per capita GDP ofUS $282 (in 2012). 

Burundi also has significant structural vulnerability due in particular to the country's landlocked status and its exposure to weather and natural hazards. According to United Nations statistics, Burundi's economic vulnerability index is 56.81 compared with an average of 45.7 in 2012 across all of the least developed countries. Faced with these development challenges, Burundi's contribution is an ambitious one, as it plans for a 3% reduction in its emissions by 2030 for the unconditional scenario, and by 20% by that same year for its conditional objective. 


### 4. CONTRIBUTION IMPLEMENTATION METHODS 

#### 4.1. Institutional arrangements for implementation 
The Government of Burundi will implement the INDC through the Ministry of the Environment, which is the government institution in charge of ensuring the implementation of international conventions relating to the environment. It will used its customized departments and institutions like IGEBU and the OBPE, which handle questions associated with climate change, but also frameworks for dialogue such as the National Environment Commission, the Sectoral Group on Water, Sanitation and the Environment (GSEAE), the National Water Partnership (PNE-Bu), and the National Platform for Risk Prevention and Disaster Management. 

#### 4.2. Capacity-building 
Despite the non-negligible step already taken to create and build capacities, national experts are still insufficient and have not yet acquired significant proficiency in the tools and methodologies available to produce GHG emissions inventories, climate change vulnerability and adaptation studies, and GHG emissions mitigation studies, as well as solid proficiency in the procedures used to compile financing applications for the available funding mechanisms. As a result, capacity-building will be needed to offset the following: 

- Insufficient climate data due to outdated facilities;  
- Insufficient  scientific  personnel  able  to  satisfactorily  run  programmes  and research topics linked to climate change;
-  Difficulty  training  technical  and  scientific  personnel  on-site  or  abroad  due  to the non-existence of training institutions specializing in climate in Burundi and limited cooperation with the outside world;  
- Insufficient quality and quantity of domestic technical expertise.  

#### 4.3. Technology transfer needs 

Burundi does not have the technical resources to do research and development in the field of climate change and has no national programme on the subject. As part of the INDC's implementation, Burundi's technology transfer actions will pertain to: 

-  Promoting  research  and  development,  adopting  new  technologies,  and harnessing them for the national context;  
-  Reinforcing the operations of certain organizations and institutions involved in climate change; 
-  Skills training, education and international cooperation. 

#### 4.4. Consideration of gender, youth and vulnerable groups 

Gender, youth and vulnerable groups are concerns that have not always been taken into account in Burundi's national and sectoral socioeconomic development plans. In its Vision 2025, the Government of Burundi considers these to be cross-cutting issues to be incorporated into all development programmes. The same will apply to implementation of the INDC. 

#### 4.5. Need for financial support 

As was underscored above, most of the climate change adaptation actions identified in previously developed national and sectoral action plans have not yet been implemented for want of the financial means to do so. The table below summarizes the financial needs for implementation of the INDC in the form of programmes.
