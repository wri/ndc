<h2>REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI</h2>
<h3>NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 2020</h3>
<h3>ANNEX</h3>
<h1>July 2021</h1>
<p><a>1. Context and planning of the 2015 NDC update</a></p>
<p>Burundi has made commitments to the international community to contribute to the fight against climate change, through its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted in 2015 at the twenty-first Conference of Parties (COP 21 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris in 2015. It became Determined Contribution in 2018 after the ratification of the Paris Agreement by Burundi.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement warns of the threat of climate change and indicates that the GHG emission reductions announced in existing commitments are not sufficient to contain global warming below the goal of 2°C. To do this, he invites the Parties to make more efforts for a transition that would make it possible to reach 1.5°C. In this context, it is useful and urgent to see how countries are implementing their commitments by implementing paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 9 and 13 of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement requires signatory countries to review their NDC every 5 years. In 2020, countries are thus invited to submit revised NDCs based on their 2015 contributions to the UNFCCC secretariat. For countries that have chosen a time horizon of 2030, the year 2020 is a first opportunity to reaffirm their commitment to fight effectively against global warming by communicating their NDC 2015 again in 2020.</p>
<p>Although Burundi has chosen a time horizon of 2030 in the NDC 2015, the Government wished to review its commitments by backing them up with more current data as well as a better alignment of the NDC with the directives of the Agreement of Paris, particularly with regard to the book of rules adopted at COP24, for the NDC 2020. In the NDC 2015, Burundi committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 3% by by 2030 without conditions and 20% under conditions.</p>
<p>The ambition envisaged for the NDC 2020 consists of improving the quality of the NDC 2015, updating the quantitative estimates with more recent data, reassessing the possibilities for mitigation and adaptation by 2020-2030 , to take into account more sectors in the definition of the objectives, to present complementary measures in terms of mitigation and to include the Communication on Adaptation in the NDC.</p>
<p>Burundi's NDC takes into account the IPCC's October 2018 special report on the consequences of global warming after the Paris Agreement. This report establishes the collective ambition to limit global warming "below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5°C".</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement warns of the threat of climate change and indicates that the GHG emission reductions announced in existing commitments are not sufficient to contain global warming below the goal of 2°C. To do this, he invites the Parties to make more efforts for a transition that would make it possible to reach 1.5°C. In this context, it is useful and urgent to see how countries are implementing their commitments by implementing paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 9 and 13 of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The updated NDCs are based on the principle of the voluntary commitment of countries and promote cooperation between countries to achieve, in a coordinated manner, common objectives in the fight against climate change which must lead to a reduction of 45% <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, in order to stay below the 1.5°C target.</p>
<p>The update of the NDC of the Republic of Burundi promotes transparency, precision, exhaustiveness, comparability and coherence and is in line with the logic of the IPCC report and the conclusions of the Talanoa Dialogue.</p>
<p>Its trajectory is planned in relation to a BAU reference scenario (<i>Business as Usual)</i> which will make it possible to measure Burundi's effort in terms of its mitigation objectives vis-à-vis the change climate.</p>
<p>The sectors taken into account in the NDC are the energy and transport sectors, Industrial Processes and Product Use (PIUP), Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFAT) as well as the waste management. Note that the forest plays an important role in both adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>1.1 Reminders on the initial NDC of Burundi (CDN 2015)</p>
<p>Burundi's initial NDC was published in 2015 and took into account aspects related to adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>a) Accommodation</p>
<p>Burundi is exposed to the adverse effects of climate change<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. These affect all sectors, in particular the Energy, Agriculture and Livestock, Water, Health, Landscapes and Terrestrial Ecosystems sectors.</p>
<p>The adaptation needs identified in the 2015 NDC concerned forestry, human, institutional, technical and financial capacity building and technology transfer. National priorities, policies and programs have been defined in terms of adaptation to climate change (PND Burundi 2018-2027, DOPEAE, PN-PA CC, preliminary PNA etc.).</p>
<p>b) Mitigation</p>
<p>Concerning mitigation, Burundi had committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 23% by 2030 compared to the reference scenario (BAU), which corresponded to a reduction of 3 % (1,958 Gg ECO2) as part of its unconditional target and 20% (14,897 Gg ECO2) as part of its conditional target.</p>
<p>According to the CDN 2015, the establishment of the BAU referred to assumptions related to the growth of the national economy (GDP), population growth as well as the rate of electrification contained in the documents below. above quoted. Some of these documents and many others developed served as the basis for the establishment of the NDC 2020 BAU.</p>
<p>Mitigation objectives have been assessed on the basis of the actions carried out contributing to the mitigation. Accounting and verification of avoided GHG emissions were calculated using the IPCC 2006 DLs. Intermediate targets for 2020 and 2025 were also defined in the 2015 CDN. The 2015 CDN emissions mitigation targets are summarized in Table 1.</p>

<p>To achieve the unconditional goal, the following measures were planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the <strong>forestry</strong> sector, Burundi planned to increase GHG sinks by (re)afforestation of 4ha/year for 15 years from 2016 until 2030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the <strong>energy</strong> sector, Burundi planned to build three hydroelectric power stations in order to increase the electrification rate to 35%, i.e. a production of 45.4 MW in 2030.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve the conditional objective, the following measures were envisaged subject to funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the forestry sector, Burundi has undertaken to (i) reforest 8,000 ha/year, for 15 years from 2016, (ii) replace 100%, by 2030, of all the ovens carbonization and all traditional domestic stoves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the agricultural sector, Burundi planned to gradually replace 100% of mineral fertilizers with organic manure by 2030.</p>

<p>The compensation mechanism for the shortfall in the implementation of the proposed NDC was based on international mechanisms relating to the compensation of greenhouse gas emissions (Article 6 AP) and on national legislation in force. vigor. In terms of forests, it was planned to promote the valuation of ecosystem services.</p>
<p>Concerning the conditional objectives, the needs in terms of support were analysed. For the conditional objectives to be achieved, capacity building support for the Ministry's services in charge of the environment and technology transfer was necessary. In addition, financial support was essential.</p>
<p>The cost of the mitigation and adaptation components for the implementation of the prioritized actions listed in the 2015 NDC by unconditional and conditional objectives was estimated at one billion four hundred ninety-three million five hundred eighty-nine thousand dollars Americans (1,493,589,000 USD).

<p>1.2 New elements contributing to the update</p>
<p>The update of Burundi's NDC takes into account new elements published since the 2015 NDC, both nationally and internationally. At the national level, these are mainly the Third GHG Inventory (2005, 2010 and 2015), the National Plan for the Development of Burundi 2018-2027 (PND BURUNDI 2018-2027), the Guidance Document for the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock (DOPEAE 2020), the National Strategy for the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of Conservation of forest ecosystems, Sustainable Management and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks (REDD+) 2019, policies and plans related to industry, transport, energy, health and gender.</p>
<p>At the international level, these are essentially the decisions resulting from COP 24 in 2018, which was held in Katowice, Poland in December 2018 and the ICTU which aims to guide countries when updating of their CDN. The Katowice package establishes Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines which specify how the Enhanced Transparency Framework (TRF) is implemented. It sets out the essential procedures and mechanisms that will operationalize the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The updated NDC is also in the implementation phase of the Paris Agreement and specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 9 and 13 of its article 4. In addition, the update takes into account Decision 4 /CMA. 1 Annex I relating to the ICTU (Information, Clarity, Transparency and Under standing) which highlights Information on Clarity, Transparency and Understanding of NDCs and integrates cross-cutting issues such as gender and social inclusion.</p>
<p>1.2.1 GHG inventory and BAU projections</p>
<p>After the submission of the 2015 NDC to the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Third Communication was developed and validated in 2019 under the coordination of the Ministry in charge of the environment with the support of the Global Environment Facility. It is based on the 3rd national GHG inventory. The methodology for calculating GHG emissions and absorptions followed the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.</p>
<p>This inventory concerns the years 2005, 2010 and 2015.</p>
<p>The greenhouse gases considered are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).</p>
<p>The sectors covered are (i) energy; (ii) Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPUP);</p>
<p>(iii) Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use (AFOLU) and (iv) waste management.</p>
<p>The TCN contains projections of emissions up to 2050 if no action is taken to mitigate GHG emissions. These projections also show mitigation scenarios based on GHG mitigation policies, measures, strategies and plans planned and implemented in Burundi.</p>
<p><a>1.2.2. Analysis of the implementation of the NDC 2015.</a></p>
<p>Prior to the update of the NDC, an analysis of the implementation of the 2015 NDC was carried out. This analysis aimed to assess the progress made in the implementation of the first NDC in relation to the Country's commitments in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by unconditional and conditional objectives.</p>
<p>Concerning the <strong>unconditional</strong> objective, it was planned in the forestry sector to afforest 4,000 ha per year for 5 years, i.e. 20,000 ha for 5 years and to build three hydroelectric power stations in order to increase the rate electrification at 35%.</p>
<p>The degree of implementation of the unconditional actions of the NDC 2015 in the forest and energy sectors in 2020 is summarized in Table 5.</p>

<p>In mitigation, the overall cost of implementing actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors per conditional objective was estimated at 1,446,118,000 USD...</p>
<p>The analysis of the 2015 NDC has made it possible to highlight certain shortcomings in the context of its implementation and to draw lessons for the 2020 update of the NDC.</p>
<p>The shortcomings identified are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Absence of a national coordination framework for the implementation of NDCs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the NDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weak capacity for the mobilization of NDC implementation resources by unconditional and conditional objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absence of a national climate finance MRV system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insufficient capacity building and technology transfer actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low awareness of ownership of the NDC by all stakeholders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lessons learned from the implementation of the 2015 NDC are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 2015 NDC is very ambitious and contains certain commitments that are not or are difficult to achieve within the planned timeframe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The measurement, reporting and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation actions are difficult to achieve due to the lack of indicators and precise information on the sectoral contributions of implementation and the existence of a MRV system for CDN.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestion for improving CDN 2020:</p>
<p>Taking into account the shortcomings observed in the NDC 2015 and its implementation as well as Burundi's commitment to increase its ambitions, new elements have been incorporated into the NDC 2020. These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The integration of the waste and industry sectors (PIUP), and the transport sub-sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account aspects related to gender and social inclusion in accordance with national policies in force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of a logical framework with measurable monitoring indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of priority mitigation and adaptation actions listed in the NDC 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment of an inclusive national coordination and monitoring framework for the implementation of the NDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The awareness of all the actors involved (political decision-makers, planners, local authorities and grassroots communities while respecting the gender dimension) in the implementation of the NDC for its appropriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration of all the actors involved in planning with a view to taking climate change into account in relation to the NDC when setting up strategic development tools (strategies and sectoral policies).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthening the institutional and technical capacities of sectoral entities with sufficient financial resources and appropriate tools for effective implementation of the NDC with a mechanism for monitoring, reporting and verification of REDD+ and other actions in terms of climate change as well as a national research and development program on adaptation to climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formulation of projects in accordance with the requirements of the various financing mechanisms and the creation of a strategic framework favorable to the mobilization of financing, following the example of several African countries Parties to the Convention, which have created a National Climate Change Fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving the data collection system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration of NDC programs in sectoral plans and policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consideration of the ICTU in the NDC 2020.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.2.4. National Plans, Policies and Strategies.</p>
<p>(i) Burundi Economic Development Plan</p>
<p>The first document published since the 2015 NDC is the National Development Plan of Burundi 2018-2027 made public in 2018. This plan was produced in a context where Burundi is experiencing major changes in the areas of administrative governance and economy with a major challenge related to the structural transformation of the national economy. It comes to face the challenges of socio-economic development. These challenges are obvious and must be resolved by the said plan for the decade 2018-2027.</p>
<p>Burundi's National Development Plan 2018-2027 (PNB) is part of a development plan based on a new dynamic of transformation of economic, demographic and social structures. This scheme generates multiplier effects that are as long-lasting on the improvement of economic growth as on the average per capita income. It will enable the satisfaction of basic needs, poverty reduction, human capital development, environmental sustainability and social equity.</p>
<p>The GNP thus constitutes a tool of strategic orientation on which the sectors will have to build their policies and action plans to contribute positively to the increase in the gross domestic product (GDP). This plan is intended to be the foundation for strong and inclusive growth from 2018 in order to enable Burundi to reach, by 2027, the level of emerging countries. Its challenge is to create the conditions necessary for lasting peace and stability for the long-term structural transformation of the economy characterized by double-digit, sustainable and equitable growth.</p>
<p>The implementation of the PND is based on five strategic orientations, namely (i) revitalizing the growth sectors; (ii) develop human capital; (iii) protecting the environment, adapting to climate change and improving land use planning, (iv) strengthening democracy, governance, the rule of law and safeguarding national sovereignty, (v) strengthening resource mobilization mechanisms and develop cooperation and partnership.</p>
<p>The updated NDC is one of the tools for implementing the National Development Plan and still takes into account the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>(ii) National policies and strategies.</p>
<p>To mitigate the adverse effects of the impacts of climate change, the Government of Burundi has defined political orientations, in particular through the PND 2018-2027, the Vision 2025 published by Burundi in 2011 and the various sectoral policies such as the National Water Strategy, National Water Strategy, National Agricultural Strategy (NAS), National Strategy and Action Plan on Biodiversity 2013-2020; the National Forest Policy and the Energy Policy Letter and its implementation strategy. In addition, it has developed and adopted strategies with action plans specific to climate change, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The National Policy and Strategy and action plan on climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Communication Strategy for adaptation to climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Action Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA, 2007).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Communications on Climate Change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Forest Strategy, 2021 replacing that of (2012).</p>

<p>.At the international level, the IPCC's special report on the consequences of global warming of 1.5<sup>o</sup>C has been published. <a href="https://climat.be/doc/181008_IPCC_sr15_spm.pdf">This special report</a> was approved at the 48th meeting of the IPCC in Incheon, South Korea and has been published since 8 October 2018.</p>
<p><a href="http://cop24.gov.pl/">It served as the scientific basis for the Talanoa Dialogue concluded during the</a> <a href="http://cop24.gov .pl/">COP 24</a> in December 2018 in Katowice, Poland to take stock of the collective efforts of Parties to achieve the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement and to encourage countries to make new, more ambitious commitments by 2020.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the Talanoa Dialogue call on all countries to submit strengthened climate plans (Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs) to the United Nations by 2020.</p>
<p>They encourage the Parties to pay specific attention to the role of the transport sector (including international aviation and shipping), the financing of the transition, the role of public and private investments, the carbon price in this context (taking into account socio-economic aspects), and the synergies of transition towards a circular economy which aims for the sober and efficient management of resources, etc.</p>
<p>1.3 CDN refresh planning</p>
<p>1.3.1 Institutional commitment</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock is the institutional coordination framework which, through its administrative and technical structure, is in charge of the NDC 2020. To this end, it has set up a national commission responsible for monitoring the update of the CDN 2015. It is made up of senior executives from the various sectors emitting GHG emissions, including the AFOLU, Energy, Transport and Processes sectors Industrial and Uses of Products and Wastes. Executives from non-emitting but cross-cutting sectors, namely health and gender, were also included in the discussions.</p>
<p>In close collaboration with the UNDP, this commission is responsible for monitoring the process of updating the NDC from the recruitment of the Bureau and the development phases (validation of the methodology, organization of retreats, technical sessions and consultation workshops with stakeholders, validation at different stages of the document and submission of the updated NDC for adoption and approval).</p>
<p>On a technical level, the NDC 2020 was carried out by a consortium of 10 national experts assisted by an international consultant.</p>
<p>1.3.2. Strengthened ambition of CDN 2020.</p>
<p>Burundi is actively involved in the NDC process and, as early as 2015, it transmitted a first NDC with mitigation objectives for 2030. However, in 2020, although the country could content itself with resubmit its 2015 NDC (since it went until 2030), Burundi embarked on an ambitious updating project.</p>
<p>The increase in ambition for the NDC 2020 consists mainly, on the one hand, of taking into account more sectors in the definition of objectives and complementary measures in terms of mitigation and, on the other hand, of including the Communication on Adaptation in the NDC.</p>
<p>The inclusion of actions concerning the Transport, PIUP and Waste sectors in the NDC 2020 increases the ambition in terms of mitigating GHG emissions.</p>
<p>This NDC therefore represents a progression compared to the previous NDC, because the coverage of emissions in terms of sectors has been extended to all the categories estimated in the GHG inventory.</p>
<p>In addition, the NDC 2020 takes into account the gender dimension and therefore reinforces its character of equity. As the scope of implementation of the NDC 2020 is national, its implementation will be fair and just according to the diverse backgrounds and lifestyles of local communities.</p>
<p>Burundi is committed to continuing to make efforts to reduce GHG emissions. It will evolve towards the objective of reducing or limiting emissions on an economy-wide scale and increasing carbon stocks, in particular through the implementation of the National Development Plan 2018-2027, and the Orientation of the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock Policy as well as other sectoral policies.</p>
<p>The NDC 2020 contributes to paragraph a) of article 2 of the AP because it plans to implement, from 2021 to 2030, projects/programmes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will also contribute to the implementation of paragraph 1 of article 4 of the PA. This is how it provides political, strategic measures and mitigation plans/programs and adaptation plans with beneficial effects for mitigation.</p>
<p>The goal is to achieve the desired global GHG cap in accordance with the best available science. Therefore, it will be possible to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases during the second half of the century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and the fight against poverty.</p>
<p>The NDC 2020 will be executed from January 1, 2021 and will end on December 31, 2030. From 2020 to 2025, a biannual assessment will be made to see the progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2025.</p>
<p>1.3.3. Participatory and inclusive approach.</p>
<p>The 2020 update of the NDC was organized with a real effort to ensure a participatory and inclusive approach during the planning, development and verification stages. It took into account the involvement of all stakeholders including state institutions, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and grassroots community associations.</p>
<p>The UN Agencies and the Technical and Financial Partners have also been concerted to give their contribution within the framework of the process of updating the NDC 2020.</p>
<p>For the 2020 update of the NDC, the consultations also gathered the opinions of civil society organizations<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</ sup></a> and researchers from the University. The aim was to involve and involve the private sector, civil society organizations, local communities, young people and the Batwa in the formulation and evaluation of mitigation projects. Particular emphasis was placed on the participation of women and indigenous peoples assimilated to the Batwa during the consultation process.</p>
<p>A total of 5 workshops bringing together all the stakeholders were organized in order to collect the data, define the actions to be considered in the unconditional and conditional scenarios of the NDC, and validate the methodological approaches and the results.</p>
<p>1.3.4. Capacity building and technology transfer</p>
<p>During the implementation of the 2015 NDC, capacity building for executives of sectoral institutions was carried out, although in very limited numbers. These reinforcements focused on tools and methodologies for greenhouse gas inventories and on studies of vulnerability, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of GHG emissions. Capacity building also focused on project financing procedures and mechanisms. However, the need for capacity building in these areas remains a national priority, because the number of reinforced staff is still insufficient and the mastery of these tools is still weak in all sectors.</p>
<p>It is within this framework that the NDC 2020 expresses a continuous need to strengthen a large number of stakeholders involved in mitigation at the level of the various sectors in order to remedy the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Limited availability of quality data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low technical knowledge for projections and analysis of mitigation measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficulty in training technical and scientific personnel due to the lack of specialized training institutions in the field of climate change on site and the limits of cooperation for training abroad.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As research and development in the field of climate change remains incomplete and the technical and financial means limited, the NDC 2020 proposes technology transfer actions to build capacity.</p>
<p>The most important actions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strengthen sectoral institutions on the establishment of reliable databases on climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support research and development in the field of climate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.3.5. Schedule of work done</p>
<p>The work of updating the CDN took place over 5 months. The work schedule can be found in Table 7.</p>

<p><strong>Burundi</strong> is a country in Central Africa with an area of 27,834 km2. It is located between 28° 50 and 30° 54 East Longitude between the Congo Basin and the eastern highlands and between 2° 30 and 4° 28 South Latitude, at the crossroads of the routes of Central Africa, Eastern Africa and even Southern Africa. The country experiences a hot and humid tropical climate influenced by the altitude and characterized by the alternation of a rainy season (October to May) and a dry season (June to September). Its rainfall and temperature are strongly influenced by the relief, the altitude of the country (772-2670 m) and by climate change. The average annual rainfall varies from 750 mm in the North-East of Burundi to more than 2000 mm in the mountainous zone. The highest annual average temperature is 24.7°C between 2006-2015 recorded in the natural region of the Imbo plain, while the lowest is 16.6°C between 2006-2015 recorded in the natural region of Mugamba .</p>
<p>From a socio-economic point of view, Burundi has approximately 12.3 million people in 2020, more than 90% of whom live in rural areas and 51% are female. Being among the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), its annual per capita income is estimated at 280 USD and its economy is essentially based on agriculture. With a density of <strong>480.99 people/km²,</strong> the population growth of 2.4% puts pressure on land resources, water resources and worsens the situation of deforestation and deforestation.</p>
<p>According to the TCN, the sectors that emit the most are agriculture, energy and waste with emissions of 4186.21 Eq CO2 in Gg, 1072.4 Eq CO2 in Gg and 230.73 respectively. CO2 eq. For other sectors, GHG emissions are insignificant.</p>

<p>For this level of method, the necessary data that can be used are the activity data on the quantity of fuels burned (activity data) and the default emission factors for each fuel from the IPCC 2006 TGs.</ p>
<p>In calculating emissions from the energy sector, the activity data used come from the energy industries, manufacturing industries, construction, trade, agriculture, forestry, fishing, residential and transport sub-sectors.</p>
<p>In the residential sub-sector, the fuels used are wood energy, bagasse<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a > made up of vegetable or agricultural waste for cooking, heating and lighting and kerosene for lighting by rural households. As for urban households, the fuels used are charcoal for cooking and partially kerosene for lighting.</p>
<p>In the transport sub-sector, the fuels used are diesel and gasoline.</p>
<p>Emissions from the combustion of vegetable or agricultural waste, which are used mainly in rural households, have not been quantified due to lack of data.</p>
<p>2.1.3.2 Agriculture and Livestock</p>
<p>The emissions calculated in this sector relate to domestic livestock (enteric fermentation and manure management) and managed soils (burning of harvested biomass residues, emissions from rice cultivation, direct N2O emissions from managed soils and CO2 emissions from liming and urea application).</p>
<p>The methodology used in the 3rd GHG inventory for the calculation of GHG emissions in the agriculture sector is level 1 and the default parameters of the 2006 IPCC GLs.</p>
<p>IPCC software from the IPCC was used to calculate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.</p>
<p>The Agriculture and Livestock sector includes the sub-sectors and categories listed in Table 11.</p>

<p>For livestock, the input data focuses on the primary characterization of the livestock to classify the animals according to what is applicable to the country taking into account the species and categories of livestock.</p>
<p>For managed soils, the activity data is the amount of biomass burned during pre-harvest fire removal of leaves from the area occupied by sugar cane. For rice growing, the activity data collected in the field concern the annual rice harvest areas and the time of the vegetative cycle. For the application of fertilizers and liming, the input data are respectively the quantities of fertilizer and lime used.</p>
<p>Daily monitoring of areas from which wood products are harvested (case of SOSUMO) is done.</p>
<p>2.1.3.3 Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPUP)</p>
<p>In the 3rd GHG inventory of Burundi, the Tier 1 methodology used for the calculation of emissions is that recommended by the 2006 IPCC guidelines in which the activity data were multiplied by emission factors by default. Calculations were made using IPCC software.</p>
<p>The emission sources taken into account are the production of lime (sub-sector of the mineral industry) and the production of iron and steel (sub-sector of the metallurgical industry). has no chemical industries. Emissions related to the non-energy use of fuels are not estimated due to lack of data.</p>
<p>The emissions of fluorinated gases and NF3 linked to the use (domestic or industrial) and the manufacture of these gases are not estimated on the one hand, because there are no national data making it possible to to estimate emissions from the use of products, and secondly because there are no industries that produce these products in Burundi.</p>
<p>In the 3rd GHG inventory of Burundi, the FAT sector includes the sub-sectors forest land, cropland, pasture, wetland and peatland.</p>
<p>Activity data are areas of both public and private forest land, areas of pasture, cropland and peatland.</p>
<p>After data collection and processing, the method used to calculate GHG emissions is that described in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The data conversion factors contained in FRA 2015 were used.</p>
<p>The calculations of emissions/removals were carried out using the IPCC 2006 software by introducing the processed activity data.</p>
<p>Based on the data entered, the software calculates emissions from biomass stock change, wetland management, forest fires and harvested wood products and sums the emissions of all categories of Land Allocation and Use (FAT).</p>
<p>For the FAT sector, in addition to these emission sources, the rate of deforestation and forest degradation, the rate of wood consumption, the development of wood-saving technologies are to be considered. </p>
<p>.Continuous monitoring and evaluation for the implementation of projects/programmes/measures designed to mitigate emissions and subsequent removals due to natural disturbances on working lands is done.</p>
<p>2.1.3.5 Waste</p>
<p>In Burundi's 3rd GHG inventory, the methodology for calculating emissions in this sector was based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories as well as the 2006 IPCC software. no country-specific emission factor, estimates were based on Tier 1 methods using mainly activity data and default parameters.</p>
<p>The categories of solid waste considered in the context of Burundi's third GHG inventory are municipal solid waste (household and commercial). Biomedical waste was not taken into account in the calculation of emissions due to the lack of data related to solid waste dumped in pits and incinerated. The calculations of emissions from solid waste only concerned the cities of Bujumbura and Gitega and certain markets. Regarding wastewater, discharges from households, commerce and industry are taken into account.</p>
<p>2.1.4. Results</p>
<p>Table 12 and Figure 1 summarize the results of Burundi's 3rd National GHG Inventory. For the conversion into CO2 equivalents, in Gg, the values of the Global Warming Potential (GWP) corresponding to a period of 100 years from the Second Assessment Report (SOD) of the IPCC were used. It is 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O.</p>

<p>Analysis of Table 16 shows that emissions in CO2 Eq in Gg from the manure management system are high. This is an error in accounting for non-CO2 emissions from this manure management system. It is for this reason that the reliable results that can be considered in the agriculture sector are those found in Table 12.</p>

<p>Chart 7: Emissions and removals from the FAT sector</p>
<p><img width="733" height="713" alt="image" src="img/BDI-NDC1-6.png"></p>
<p>The results show that the main source of emissions from the FAT sector is the conversion of pasture to cropland, which for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 represent 75%, 74.2% and 70.7% respectively. Forest conversion ranks second with respectively 22.5%, 24.1% and 27.5% of total sector emissions, while the contribution of peatlands to FAT sector emissions remains low (around 2%).</p>
<p>As for absorptions, we note that there was a decrease in absorption capacities of 32% between 2005 and 2010 and of 48% between 2010 and 2015. This was mainly due to the problems of deforestation to the profits of agriculture, housing and public infrastructure. Through these figures, we notice that the data used to carry out the inventories do not reflect reality. The evolution of GHG emissions from the FAT sector depends on the use of wood either for cooking or in construction which have impacts on forest degradation and the conversion of forest land for agriculture or constructions. Demography is therefore one of the causes that accentuates the increase in emissions from the FAT sector. On the other hand, the increase in carbon sinks depends on the increase in forest areas and good practices for the conservation and management of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Reforestation and the fight against the conversion of forest lands and pastures for other speculations are important avenues for mitigation through the REDD+ process.</p>

<p>Table 18 shows that emissions from the waste sector represent respectively 10.88% in 2005, 7.22% in 2010 and 4.21% in 2015 compared to the total GHG emissions of the third greenhouse gas inventory. greenhouse ( Cfr table 12).</p>
<p>2.2 NDC 2020 mitigation scenarios</p>
<p>2.2.1. Indicator, Baseline year and target year(s)</p>
<p>As part of the CDN 2020, the reference indicator is a <strong>quantitative</strong> indicator of GHG emissions, <strong>relating</strong> to a "Business as Usual" scenario (BAU ) integrating all sectors of the 3rd national GHG inventory and <strong>annual</strong> for 2 target years.</p>
<p>Being an indicator defined in relation to a reference scenario, the years corresponding to the targets are the years 2025 and 2030.</p>
<p>The updated NDC will have a 10-year period spread over two periods. The first period will start with January 1, 2021 and end on December 31, 2030 with an interim year of 2025.</p>
<p>The 2020 NDC defines 2 scenarios: the reference scenario and the mitigation scenario.</p>
<p>The Reference Scenario retained is the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario which corresponds to the trend in the evolution of GHG emissions in the event that Burundi does not take any mitigation measures while the mitigation scenario involves the implementation of actions contributing to the reduction of GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Two mitigation scenarios are distinguished: the scenario by <strong>unconditional objective</strong> (attainable by Burundi's own resources) and the scenario by <strong>conditional objective</strong> (attainable by support of international cooperation in accordance with Articles 9 and 6 of the Paris Agreement).</p>
<p>Perimeter</p>
<p>The scope of the NDC 2020 projections covers the entire national territory of Burundi. The CDN 2020 takes into account all the sectors counted in the 3rd national GHG inventory for the calculation of the target values. In particular, the Cropland, Peatlands and Harvested Wood Products sub-sectors of TSF, the Industrial Products and Product Uses (IPUP) sector, transport and the waste sector are now taken into account in the calculation. of the target value. This was not the case in the 2015 NDC and this demonstrates an increase in Burundi's ambition. The sectors that are affected by the updated NDC are shown in Table 19.</p>

<p>For these sectors, all the gases considered in the 3rd inventory are also taken into account in the calculation of the target value, namely CO2, CH4 and N2O. HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3 gases have not been taken into account because they are not estimated in the 3rd national GHG inventory.</p>
<p>The NDC 2020 takes into account Article 5 of the Paris Agreement on the enhancement of GHG sinks and reservoirs as provided for in subparagraph (d) of paragraph 1 of Article 4 of the Convention, in particular forests and the REDD+ mechanism. Paragraph 1 of Article 5 calls on Parties to take measures to conserve and enhance carbon sinks.</p>
<p>2.2.3. Calculation method for emissions / absorptions of the different scenarios</p>
<p>The formula used to calculate avoided emissions per action is as follows:</p>
<p>E=DA x EF where DA= activity data (DA) and EF= emission factor (EF) proposed by default for each gas and each fuel by the 2006 IPCC GLs.</p>
<p>The mitigation scenario is established by implementing mitigation actions aimed at reducing GHG emissions. The calculation of avoided emissions is made by deducting the calculated emissions per mitigation action from the BAU emissions.</p>
<p>Concerning the <strong>2 mitigation scenarios</strong>, the approach consisted of calculating the avoided emissions by 2025 and 2030, per action retained in the NDC for each sector, then subtracting these avoided emissions to the values of the sectoral reference scenario.</p>
<p>For the conversion into CO2 equivalents, the values of the Global Warming Potential (GWP) corresponding to a period of 100 years recommended in the second assessment report of the IPCC have been applied. It is 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O.</p>
<p>2.2.4. BAU reference scenario.</p>
<p>The BAU emissions value is subject to change due to methodological changes and improvements in the compilation of future greenhouse gas inventories.</p>
<p>The BAU reference scenario is established if no action is taken for the implementation of policies, plans and strategies that can contribute to GHG mitigation. The BAU considered is that of the TCN which is projected until 2030 from 2015.</p>

<p>As part of the 3rd National Climate Communication, the BAU scenario for the Agriculture sector has been defined and emissions projections up to 2050 have been made.</p>
<p>As with other sectors, the BAU baseline scenario is built on assumptions where no action is taken to implement those policies, plans or strategies that can mitigate emissions from domestic livestock and soils managed.</p>
<p>The projected parameters of the BAU scenario are linked to the evolution of the numbers of cattle, goats, sheep for domestic livestock. As for the managed soils, the parameters are related to the areas of land for rice, areas harvested for sugar cane, the quantities of nitrogen fertilizers and urea used for the managed soils.</p>

<p>2.2.4.4.2Assumptions and projection parameters</p>
<p>As part of the 3rd National Communication, the BAU scenario for the FAT sector has been defined and projections of sectoral emissions up to 2050 have been calculated.</p>
<p>In the FAT sector, the projection assumptions of the BAU scenario of emissions are based on the decrease in the rate of forest cover and the increase in the need for forest products either for construction or energy. The BAU scenario is based on the non-implementation of policy measures leading to the fight against deforestation and forest degradation and the strengthening of carbon stocks. The projection parameters are based on population data, deforested and/or degraded forest areas, wood consumption ratio, demographic and economic growth as well as activity data for the reference year.</p>
<p>As part of the CDN 2020, the assumptions and parameters of the reference scenario of the TCN FAT sector for 2025 and 2030 have been retained.</p>

<p>The National Development Plan of Burundi 2018-2027, the national policy on climate change, the national strategy for adaptation to climate change, the three National Communications on climate change and the policy letter as well as the sectoral strategy of the energy sector provide essential measures and technologies for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. They focus on the introduction of new technologies and measures aimed at improving the conditions of production and use of energy sources with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, replacing the technologies currently in use.</p>
<p>The programs and projects considered as priorities are the construction of hydroelectric and solar power plants, the promotion of improved wood carbonization techniques, the promotion of improved domestic charcoal stoves in urban and rural areas, the promotion of biogas in schools and detention facilities and improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p>In the 2020 NDC, several actions for implementing these priority programs having an impact in terms of mitigation are retained under the unconditional scenario and are described in Table 28.</p>

<p>The avoided emissions of the mitigation scenario are equal to the default emission factors (Tier 1) of the substituted technology/fuel multiplied by the energy consumption avoided due to the implementation of the actions. The IPCC Tools 2006 software made it possible to quantify these emissions to be avoided by entering the activity data for each project in relation to the practice that was in place.

<p>The Ministry in charge of Agriculture and Livestock has drawn up a policy document for the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock. The latter is based on the PND 2018-2027 and the PNIA 2018-2022. To implement these strategic measures contained in these documents, the Ministry plans to draw up a national policy on livestock in permanent stalls.</p>
<p>However, no action to support this policy is retained in the conditional objective.</p>
<p>2.2.5.1.7. Sector Forestry and others Land use 2.2.5.1.7.1. Plans, strategies and mitigation actions retained</p>
<p>Burundi has developed Plans and Strategies that can have an impact in terms of mitigation in connection with the TSF sector, by reducing GHG emissions from the forestry sector through good forest resource management practices or by increasing GHG sink. The most important are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The National Development Plan 2018-2027 which, in its strategic orientation 3, envisages the protection of the environment, adaptation to climate change and the improvement of land use planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Orientation Document for the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock Policy,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Forest Policy which, in its specific objective 2, plans to increase the rate of forest cover to 20% by 2025,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Strategy for the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, (+) the role of the Conservation of forest ecosystems and the Sustainable Management of forests as well as the improvement of carbon stocks,</ p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Climate Change Policy which, in its axis 2, envisages the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and low-carbon development; etc.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These plans, policies and strategies have been considered to define the actions of the TSF sector to be retained within the framework of the unconditional scenario of the NDC 2020.</p>

<p>Plans, strategies and mitigation actions retained</p>
<p>The National Development Plan of Burundi 2018-2027, the national sanitation policy, the national plan for adaptation to climate change, the National Communications on climate change etc., provide for actions for the mitigation of emissions greenhouse gases from the waste sector.</p>
<p>However, within the framework of the CDN 2020, no action is envisaged due to the lack of reliable data on the quantification of waste and the landfill sites are not known, except for a few sites identified in the third gas inventory greenhouse located in the city of Bujumbura.</p>
<p>2.2.5.1.8.2. Assumptions and projection parameters</p>
<p>As there are no planned actions per unconditional scenario in the NDC 2020, assumptions and projection parameters are not necessary.</p>
<p>2.2.5.1.8.3. GHG impact</p>
<p>By unconditional objective, no priority has been retained. Therefore, the waste sector has no impact in terms of reducing GHG emissions,</p>
<p>2.2.5.2 Setting the target</p>
<p>The target of the unconditional scenario is a reduction in national emissions of 1.58% compared to the BAU scenario by 2025 and 3.04% in 2030<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>2.2.5.2.1 Calculation method</p>
<p>The methodology for calculating the target at the level of each sector, we first add up the avoided or absorbed emissions of all the priority actions of the sector. The value of the national target in CO2 equivalent in Gg per unconditional objective corresponds to the sum of emissions/removals resulting from the implementation of priority actions in all sectors. In percentage terms, the target value is the ratio between the sum of the sectoral emissions of the unconditional scenario and the sum of the sectoral emissions of the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario.</p>
<p>The value of target "C" in % is expressed by the following equation: X/Y*100. Where X= ∑of the sectoral emissions of the unconditional scenario in EqCO2 in Gg.</p>
<p>Y = ∑ of the sectoral emissions of the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario in EqCO2 in Gg.</p>
<p>2.2.5.2.2 Summary of avoided emissions and additional absorptions</p>

<p>The actions retained in the scenario of the unconditional objective have impacts on health, especially by reducing illnesses resulting from smoke from the combustion of wood, air pollution by gases from vehicle emissions. Other impacts on the improvement of living conditions are important thanks to the increase in access to electrical energy, in particular the growth of household incomes through the creation of jobs and the modernization as well as the diversification of activities. income generators.

<p>2.2.7.1.2. Assumptions and projection parameters</p>
<p>The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions by different energy sources is based on parameters, including population, technologies or measures adopted, lifestyle of the population and fuel emission factors used. The amount of emissions is equal to the emission factors which are multiplied by the energy values. The IPCC Tools 2006 software made it possible to quantify the emissions to be avoided by entering the activity data for each action in relation to the practice that was in place. This methodology was applied to all the actions identified as part of the 2015 NDC update. Table 47 shows the parameters used for accounting for these emissions.</p>

<p>2.2.7.2.2. Assumptions and projection parameters</p>
<p>The projection hypotheses are linked to the economy (GDP), to the purchasing power of the populations to supply lime for agriculture and rebar and steel used in construction.</p>
<p>The projection parameters are the quantities of lime, iron and steel. Other parameters are emission factors. To calculate emissions from lime production, the formula is C(tonne of CO2) <strong>=AXB,</strong> Conversion to Gg of CO2 <strong>D=C/10</strong>3 </p>
<p>These parameters are: <strong>A:</strong> Quantity of lime produced in tons: 1908 tons in 2015.</p>
<p>B: Emission factors by type of lime produced (tonne of CO2/tonne of lime produced): 0.75.</p>
<p>2.2.6.2.3 Impacts in terms of mitigations.</p>
<p>As the inventory experts did not have field data, the mitigation actions were calculated by reducing the emissions from the 2015 inventory by 3% every 5 years, i.e. a reduction 2% compared to the reference scenario.</p>

<p>2.2.7.3.1 P&amp;M, plans and priority actions selected.</p>
<p>The Ministry in charge of Agriculture and Livestock has drawn up a Policy Document for the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock. The latter is based on the PND 2018-2027 and the PNIA 2018-2022. To implement these strategic measures contained in these documents, the Department plans to draw up a national policy on livestock in permanent stalls. The success of this policy will be based on agro-sylvo-zootechnical systems which make it possible to increase feed for livestock by increasing the areas of fodder crops, silage and organic manure through the composting system. This is how improving the composition of animal feed by adopting agro-silvo-zootechnical integration systems has been retained as a national priority.</p>

<p>2.2.7.6 Conditions for achieving these objectives</p>
<p>Actions have been identified in all sectors. The cost of implementation is estimated at one billion six hundred eighty-nine thousand one hundred two thousand US dollars (1,689,102). Their implementation requires the commitment of all stakeholders. The Parties committed to the Paris Agreement in Annex I should support Burundi by granting it the necessary funding for the implementation of the programs identified in accordance with Article 9 of the Paris Agreement. The Technical and Financial Partners are called upon to be alongside Burundi to support it in the execution of the actions identified.</p>
<p>As the implementation of certain actions requires technical expertise, capacity building in the various areas of intervention is essential. It is a question of building the capacities of all the stakeholders in the transfer of knowledge for the acquisition of financing as well as the transfer of technologies.</p>
<p>Achieving results will depend on the establishment of a robust implementation mechanism that builds on existing institutional, legislative and financial arrangements. These must be strengthened to be operational and effective.</p>
<p>The involvement of all stakeholders is essential to achieve the expected results. Consideration of gender and social inclusion is encouraged.</p>
<p>The achievement of these actions identified by conditional objective will give a boost to the socio-economic and environmental development of our country.</p>
<p>2.2.7.7 Setting the target</p>
<p>The target of the conditional scenario is to reduce national emissions by 11% compared to the BAU scenario by 2025 and by 13% compared to the BAU scenario by 2030.</p>
<p>2.2.7.8 Calculation method</p>
<p>The methodology for calculating the target at the level of each sector, we first add up the avoided or absorbed emissions of all the priority actions of the sector. The value of the national target in CO2 equivalent in Gg per conditional objective corresponds to the sum of emissions/removals resulting from the implementation of priority actions in all sectors. In percentage terms, the target value is the ratio between the sum of the sectoral emissions of the conditional scenario and the sum of the sectoral emissions of the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario.</p>
<p>The value of target "C" in % is expressed by the following equation: X/Y*100. Where X= ∑of the sectoral emissions of the conditional scenario in Eq CO2 in Gg.</p>
<p>Y = ∑ of the sectoral emissions of the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario in Eq CO2 in Gg.</p>
<p>2.2.7.9 Summary of avoided emissions and absorptions</p>
<p>The summary of avoided emissions and removals in all sectors can be found in Table 53.</p>

<p>3.1 Other impacts</p>
<p>The actions retained in the scenario of the conditional objective have impacts on health, especially by reducing illnesses resulting from smoke from the combustion of wood, air pollution by gases from vehicle emissions. Other impacts on the improvement of living conditions are significant thanks to the increase in access to electrical energy, <strong>in particular</strong> the growth of household incomes through the creation of jobs and the modernization and diversification of income-generating activities. <strong>They also have positive effects on biodiversity conservation, including soil conservation, water supply, etc.</strong></p>

<p> To this end, it has set up a national commission responsible for monitoring the update of the CDN 2015. It is made up of executives from the various sectors (AFAT, Energy including transport, PIUP and Waste). Executives involved in related themes (Health, Gender) have also been integrated into the Commission. In close collaboration with the UNDP, this commission is responsible for monitoring the process of updating the NDC from the recruitment of the Bureau and the implementation phases (validation of the methodology, organization of retreats for technical sessions and consultations with stakeholders and validation by stages of the document and submission of the updated NDC for adoption and approval).</p>
<p>Technically, the NDC 2020 was carried out by a PREFED/CAREPED Consortium which aligned 10 national experts (6 sector experts, an economist, a gender specialist, a health expert and a climate expert) with the support of an international consultant.</p>

<p><strong>Burundi</strong> is a country in Central Africa with an area of 27,834 km2. It is located between 28° 50 and 30° 54 East Longitude between the Congo Basin and the eastern highlands and between 2° 30 and 4° 28 South Latitude, at the crossroads of the routes of Central Africa, Eastern Africa and even Southern Africa. The country experiences a hot and humid tropical climate influenced by the altitude and characterized by the alternation of a rainy season (October to May) and a dry season (June to September). Its rainfall and temperature are strongly influenced by the relief, the altitude of the country (772-2670 m) and by climate change. The average annual rainfall varies from 750 mm in the North-East of Burundi to more than 2000 mm in the mountainous zone. The highest annual average temperature is 24.7°C between 2006-2015 recorded in the natural region of the Imbo plain, while the lowest is 16.6°C between 2006-2015 recorded in the natural region of Mugamba .</p>
<p>From a socio-economic point of view, Burundi has approximately 12.3 million people in 2020, more than 90% of whom live in rural areas and 51% are female. Being among the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), its annual per capita income is estimated at 280 USD and its economy is mainly based on agriculture.</p>
<p>With a density of <strong>480.99 people/km²,</strong> the population growth of 2.4% puts pressure on land resources, water resources and worsens the situation of deforestation and deforestation.</p>
<p>According to the TCN, the sectors that emit the most are agriculture, energy and waste with emissions of 4186.21 Eq CO2 in Gg, 1072.4 Eq CO2 in Gg and 230.73 respectively. CO2 eq. For other sectors, GHG emissions are insignificant.</p>

<p>Assumptions are based on economic growth and population data. The methodological approach for accounting for emissions is the use of IPCC Tools 2006 software.</p>
<p>The calculation of the target values in percentage of the indicator for the 2025 and 2030 horizons for the conditional and unconditional objectives of the NDC 2020 was made by summing the emissions avoided thanks to the actions retained in the NDC.

<p>Emissions from the managed soils sub-sector are not accounted for in BAU emissions.</p>
<p>The same is true for the reference levels with regard to the different sectors. To this end, the calculation of the GHG emissions of the BAU scenario was carried out for all sectors (energy, PIUP, agriculture (excluding managed soils), FAT and waste) using the Level 1 methodologies presented in the <strong>Lines 2006 IPCC Guidelines</strong> (GL 2006).</p>
<p>The indicators for the mitigation actions selected for 2025 and 2030 have been defined for each sector.</p>

<p>The main assumptions for all sectors are those related to the economy, population growth, energy consumption per household, etc.</p>
<p>The BAU scenario is a scenario that gives indicators of the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions over time if measures of plans, policies or strategies are not taken to mitigate these emissions.

<p>4. COMMUNICATION ON ADAPTATION</p>
<p>4.1 National situation, institutional arrangements and legal frameworks</p>
<p>4.1.1 National situation</p>
<p>Burundi is a country in Central Africa with an area of 27,834 square km. It is located between 28° 50 and 30° 54 East Longitude between the Congo Basin and the eastern highlands and between 2° 30 and 4° 28 South Latitude, at the crossroads of the routes of Central Africa, Eastern Africa and even Southern Africa. Burundi has a hot and humid tropical climate.</p>
<p>Its rainfall and temperature are strongly influenced by the relief, the altitude of the country (772-2670 m) and by climate change. The average temperature is 21°C. Rainfall distribution is unevenly distributed across the country, with the high mountains of the Congo-Nile Ridge receiving the greatest amounts of annual rainfall at 1600 to 2000 mm and the Ruzizi Plain at the West as well as the depressions of the natural region of Bugesera; in the North East, receiving the lowest amounts of annual precipitation between 800 and 1000 mm.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, Burundi is among the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Its annual per capita income is estimated at 202 USD and its economy is mainly based on agriculture. With a population of 11.9 million and a density of 480.99 people/km²<strong>,</strong> the population growth of 2.4% puts pressure on land resources, water resources and worsens the situation of deforestation and deforestation.</p>
<p>4.1.2. Institutional framework</p>
<p>In Burundi, the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock (MINEAGRIE) through the General Directorate of Environment, Water Resources and Sanitation is responsible for the coordination of the implementation of sectoral policies on climate change. The services of the central administration and the public establishments of the Geographical Institute of Burundi (IGEBU) and the Burundian Office for the Protection of the Environment (OBPE) provide their support.</p>
<p>IGEBU and OBPE are also respectively National Focal Point and Deputy National Focal Point of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In addition, the Director General of Agriculture in the said Ministry is the Designated National Authority (DNA) for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and the focus of the Global Environment Fund (GEF) is ensured by the Permanent Secretary of the MINING.</p>
<p>In the context of climate change, the IGEBU is responsible for the collection, analysis, processing and dissemination of meteorological and hydrological data. As for the OBPE, the related missions are to (i) implement policies and strategies on the environment and climate change and (ii) put in place mechanisms for mitigating and adapting to climate change. climate change (the implementation of the NAP).</p>
<p>In addition to MINEAGRIE, other Ministries in charge of Energy, Public Health, Trade, Transport, Industry and Tourism are concerned by issues related to climate change.</ p>
<p>Given that climate change has a transversal impact on all key sectors of the national economy, effective resilience to this problem requires the adoption of a multisectoral and multidisciplinary approach. The latter makes it possible to strengthen consultation between actors in the field, to facilitate the establishment of a harmonized framework for future interventions as well as to mobilize financial resources for the implementation of the NAPA and the NDC.</p>

</ul>
<p>4.2. Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities</p>
<p>Through various IGEBU stations, Burundi has basic climate data and data management systems, as well as forecast products. However, the production of data and products for monitoring extreme hydrometeorological events is low, due to weak technical and financial capacities.</p>
<p>Referring to TCNCC data, Burundi also presents thermal variations depending on its geographical areas. This is because the higher regions experience colder temperatures on average than the lowlands.</p>
<p>The analysis of the evolution of the average, maximum and minimum inter-decadal temperature shows that the warming began with the decade 1986-1995 with the record which appeared respectively during the decade 2006-2015 followed by the decade 1996-2005. The record of the average maximum temperature was recorded during the decade 1996-2005 and the average minimum temperature was observed during the decade 2006-2015. All the temperature analyzes (interannual, inter-decadal and inter-normal temperature evolution analysis) show that the temperatures recorded at the Bujumbura station at the airport have an upward trend.</p>
<p>According to the TCNCC (2019), periods of water scarcity have led to periods of prolonged drought since 1917 affecting, among other things, access to water and agricultural production. However, the year 2006 of great drought in the North of the Country, was followed by a period of serious floods strongly affecting the major part of the country, in particular the provinces of Kayanza, Ngozi, Ruyigi, Bururi, and Makamba. The main extreme events that have occurred in Burundi are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 2009, torrential rains threatened almost the entire territory, especially the plain of Imbo, Mumirwa, the region of Buyenzi and the center-east of the country in the regions of Mugamba and Kirimiro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2010, torrential rains fell on the city of Bujumbura, affecting among others the international airport of Bujumbura.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2011, torrential rains flooded three urban communes of Bujumbura causing significant damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In February 2014, following the flooding of the northern districts of Bujumbura Mairie, in Gatunguru and its surroundings, nearly 1,000 houses collapsed, 20,000 people were left homeless, and 77 deaths were recorded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since September 2015, over 4 million people have been affected by heavy or torrential rains, water shortages, high winds, floods and landslides. These climatic events destroyed more than 30,000 hectares of crops, more than 5,000 homes, more than 300 classrooms and around 50 bridges. More than 42,000 people have been displaced and are believed to still be in humanitarian need in the provinces of Kirundo, Makamba, Bubanza, Cibitoke and Ruyigi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dtm.iom.int/burundi">In November 2015, with the El Nino phenomenon, floods affected at least 30,000 people, including 52 deaths. According to IOM (</a><a href="https://dtm.iom.int/burundi">DTM</a><a href="https://dtm.iom.int/burundi"> ,</a> 2019) an estimated 31,000 people were displaced by climatic events during 2019. Torrential rains, high winds and landslides displaced 13,856 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, heavy rains also destroyed crops and affected livelihoods. Following this event, 15% of the Burundian population suffered from severe food insecurity in April 2019.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the TCNCC, the projection of climate parameters in Burundi shows an upward trend in rainfall and temperature. Climate models show an increase in annual precipitation between 12 and 13.15% by 2030 and 2050 for the country's 6 meteorological stations. They also show an increase in the annual maximum temperature between 0.80 and 0.91°C by 2030 and an increase between 1.89 and 2.02°C by 2050. The annual minimum temperature will increase between 0.91 and 0.99°C by by 2030 and between 2.04 and 2.14°C by 2050 for all scenarios and meteorological stations. The greatest temperature rise will occur during the dry season, increasing over time. The projected variations for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures do not indicate significant differences between the two scenarios but differences with the horizons (2030 and 2050).</p>
<p>According to the TCNCC (2019), increases or intensity of total rainfall, are likely to cause flooding in the plains of western Imbo and erosion in the southern zone and the central plateau having as following consequences on the inhabitants of the hills and plains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exposure to disasters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decrease in agricultural production;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affecting public infrastructure, biodiversity and siltation of dams;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An increase in the risk of vector-borne diseases in the plain of Imbo, Kumoso and in the lowlands of the marshes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4.3. National adaptation priorities, strategies, policies, plans, targets and actions</p>
<p>Based on lessons learned from existing adaptation projects and programs, this section presents priority adaptation measures to address the main impacts, vulnerabilities and risks to climate change.</p>
<p>Since the development of the old NAPA in 2007, Burundi has implemented several adaptation projects and programs, particularly in the sectors of agriculture and natural resources, energy and management. some water. Lessons learned from their implementation can be used for future projects and programs, especially in terms of: potential for scaling up, information on climate change, awareness raising and capacity building, planning for adaptation at the sub-national level and strengthening private sector engagement, among others.</p>
<p>The implementation of adaptation initiatives has experienced shortcomings related to the identification of sectors, the insufficiency of adaptation priorities, the non-continuity of project support and weak capacity building.</p>
<p>To strengthen the future implementation of adaptation priorities, two main concerns should be taken into consideration, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify and summarize lessons learned from implemented adaptation projects and programs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build capacity for the continued implementation of adaptation activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The determination of adaptation programs is made after examining strategic documents such as the PND Burundi 2018-2027, PANA, the CDN, and the TCNCC. After having carried out an analysis of sectoral vulnerabilities on the basis of a participatory approach, the team of experts proceeded to the selection of criteria for prioritization of priority activities in the various sectors selected using, among other things, Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) which made it possible to take into account qualitative variables and parameters, and which integrate the necessary information concerning the degree of adverse effects of climate change. Six prioritization criteria were selected and made it possible to establish a hierarchy at the scale of the sectors, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Risk of loss of Life;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk of loss of Quality of Life;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of the implication of climate change;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribution to the Fight against Poverty / Sustainable Development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feasibility / Sustainability / Safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefit for the Environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these criteria, the sector scores definitively set the key sectors vulnerable to climate risks as follows:</p>
<p>1°. Agriculture and Livestock</p>
<p>2°. Natural resources/ecosystems/forests 3°. Water Resources</p>
<p>4°. Health</p>
<p>5°. Energy</p>
<p>6°. Infrastructure</p>
<p>In addition, priority areas have been proposed, in particular in the National Policy on Climate Change (2012), the National Strategy and Action Plan on Climate Change (2012) as well as in the National Development Plan 2018 -2027 whose overall strategic objective is “Promote development that is resilient to the adverse effects of climate change”. The SNPACC defines six strategic axes relating to adaptation. It is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adaptation and management of climate risks,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of Research-Development and technology transfer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacity building;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge management and communication;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involvement of gender, youth and vulnerable groups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding Mobilization</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these strategic axes, a series of priority adaptation programs are identified in various documents, in particular: the PND 2018-2027, Priority Action Programs (2018), the PANA (2007), SNPACC ( 2013), CDN (2015), TCNCC (2019), Orientation Document for Environmental, Agricultural and Livestock Policy (2020), and sectoral documents such as the PNIA 2016-2020.</p>
<p>5. ADAPTATION</a></p>
<p>Overall, the objective of implementing adaptation measures is to increase the resilience of ecosystems and populations to the impacts of climate variability and change. Based on the projection model of two key parameters of temperature and precipitation and according to the prioritization criteria, the following priority actions have been chosen in 2 unconditional and conditional scenarios.</p>

<p>stakeholders from the target Ministries of research institutes; as well as the private sector and civil society is a fundamental part of the NAP implementation strategy.</p>
<p>Burundi has, to date, implemented a series of adaptation programs financed mainly by bilateral and multilateral donors, such as the GEF, African Development Bank (AfDB), World Bank and GIZ, as well as national funds for programs like the National Reforestation Program. The management of environmental funds, such as GEF, Adaptation Fund, Blue Fund and the Green Climate Fund is held by the Ministry in charge of the environment. This is an asset to capitalize on synergies and capacities.</p>
<p>5.4. Implementation of adaptation measures and plans</p>
<p>As part of the implementation of the NAP, the prerequisites are essential for political decision-makers to take ownership of the NAP, to acquire the technical and financial means necessary for the implementation of the NAP as well as to develop and to implement a fundraising strategy for adaptation in Burundi.</p>
<p>For decision-makers, implementation should focus on the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strengthen the coordination mechanism through a multisectoral and multidisciplinary approach to strengthen consultation between actors in the field, facilitate the establishment of a harmonized framework for future interventions as well as the mobilization of financial resources for the implementation implementation of the NAP and the NDC;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raising awareness among relevant stakeholders of the importance of adaptation and advocating for the recognition of adaptation to climate change as a national priority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage technical and financial partners to invest in the field of climate change;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare legal texts in the field of climate change and provide them with implementing texts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmonize sectoral policies with the PND taking into account climate change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop awareness and training programs on the theme of “climate change”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To Stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Own and participate in the implementation of the NAP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in the development of awareness and training programs on the theme of climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5.5. Progress made and results</p>
<p>Burundi submitted its Third National Communication on Climate Change in 2019 to the UNFCCC Secretariat. Currently, the country is revising its NDC. The Government of Burundi has recognized that the NAP process and the revision of the NDC are complementary processes which, when brought into line, promote action and facilitate the mobilization of resources for adaptation. The NAP can contribute to the definition of adaptation ambition within the framework of the NDC.</p>
<p>5.6. Adaptation efforts</p>
<p>In Burundi, climate change is a reality and the consequences on the survival of communities are getting worse day by day, hence adaptation measures are essential and should be a national priority.</p>
<p>In the conditions of climate change, everyone (especially farmers) tries to adapt. People usually start by changing their technical practices by changing crop varieties and promoting improved cropping practices. The use of the means of production (work, inputs) is reasoned to take account of the risks: this results in some cases in the extensification, elsewhere in the concentration of the means on "safer" spaces (taking into account the availability water).</p>
<p>Among breeders, we note, on the one hand, the change in the structure of the herds, in particular the distribution between different animal species and, on the other hand, the modification of the fodder calendars based in particular on the permanent stabling of the herds .</p>
<p>In other cases, the search for solutions often lies outside agriculture, with the search for other non-agricultural jobs, which is at the origin of the internal and external migrations observed today.</p>
<p>At the decision-making and institutional level, adaptation efforts are also mobilized despite their inefficiency and are manifested in the implementation of legal texts, strategies and plans that propose adaptation solutions, in order to mitigate the risks involved. by these climatic changes.</p>
<p>5.7. Cooperation to strengthen adaptation at the national, regional and international levels</p>
<p>At the national level, the strengthening of cooperation concerns the intervention of all stakeholders to adapt to climate change at all stages of planning and implementation of programs included in the NDC</p>
<p>At the regional level, cooperation is manifested through regional partnership agreements such as COMIFAC and the Community of East African Countries</p>
<p>The Parties to the Paris Agreement recognize the importance of international support and cooperation for adaptation efforts and the need to take into consideration the needs of Burundi, which is particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change</p>
<p>5.8. Obstacles, difficulties and gaps</p>
<p>Climate governance has certain gaps, difficulties and obstacles in the regulatory frameworks and policies relevant to adaptation, the main ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Weak multisectoral and multidisciplinary coordination on climate change, including adaptation due to the lack of a functional and permanent technical working group;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited institutional and individual technical capacities to translate policy priorities and foster effective implementation of activities, projects and programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low level of integration of adaptation in the national and sector planning and budgeting process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited ability to mobilize and access funding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A regulatory framework that is not sufficiently functional;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of climate focal points in all key sectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5.9. Good practices, lessons learned and exchange of information</p>
<p>In the implementation of ongoing or nearing completion adaptation projects and programs, good practices and lessons can be learned, particularly in the agriculture and natural resources sectors.</ p>
<p>Thus, the lessons learned are stated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The NAP process could be based on awareness-raising and capacity building activities of government actors responsible for community development organizations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Importance of the projects for the regional integration of adaptation, which could be pursued within the framework of the implementation of the NAP;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some projects have enabled the achievement of common adaptation and mitigation objectives as well as the mobilization of private sector investment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NAP process will build on the targets to produce coordinated results at sub-national levels contributing to the formulation of the national adaptation plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NAP can be supported by capacity building activities and systems for collecting and disseminating meteorological and hydrological information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NAP process strengthens climate information systems and related capacities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NAP process strengthens climate information and early warning systems, as well as climate change vulnerability maps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The communication strategy can serve as the basis for developing a communication plan for the NAP process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5.10. Monitoring and evaluation</p>
<p>In its implementation, the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of the NAP will make it possible to verify whether this process is proceeding as planned. Adaptation monitoring and evaluation makes it possible to assess the impacts (in the short, medium and long term) of the priority actions carried out and whether these actually contribute to the achievement of the objectives defined on the reduction of vulnerability. On the other hand, M&amp;E can enable learning about adaptation by doing, reorienting actions according to need, as well as monitoring financial flows in the field of climate change.</p>
<p>Currently, Burundi does not have an M&amp;E framework for climate change. National climate change and environment plans and strategies do not define the M&amp;E system or objectively verifiable indicators. The National Strategy and Action Plan on Climate Change as well as the National Development Plan propose a set of indicators, but these lack a baseline and targets. There is a National REDD+ Strategy (2019) which proposes a national forest monitoring system based on Measurement,</p>
<p>Notification and Verification (MRV), but its implementation is not effective. It will be necessary to set up a tooled mechanism of S&amp;E.</p>
<p>5.11. Adaptation measures and/or economic diversification plans</p>
<p>These measures refer to the implementation of various plans and strategies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the National Action Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA 2007);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the PND Burundi 2018-2027;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the National Communication Strategy on climate change;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Burundi has implemented several adaptation projects and programs, particularly in the agriculture and natural resources sectors. Lessons learned from their implementation can be used for future projects and programs, especially in terms of: potential for scaling up, information on climate change, awareness raising and capacity building, planning for adaptation at the sub-national level and strengthening private sector engagement, among others.</p>
<p>5.12. Contributions to other international frameworks and/or conventions</p>
<p>Adaptation in the Climate Change sector involves a variety of actors and establishes a common international conceptual framework which is the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the Ministry in charge of the Environment in 1988, the Government of Burundi has begun the process of drafting laws relating to the protection of the environment and its natural resources.</p>
<p>Although these texts have been promulgated, they have remained ineffective in the field of climate change for lack of application texts on the one hand, and for not having been sufficiently popularized and brought to the attention of actors at the sectoral level on the other hand.</p>
<p>Among the legal tools on which the country can count to fight against climate change, it is also worth mentioning the international conventions ratified by Burundi such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands. These conventions are often sources of funds for adaptation activities.</p>
<p>5.13. Consideration of gender issues, traditional knowledge, indigenous peoples' knowledge and local knowledge systems</a></p>
<p>The NDC 2020 is based on Burundi's PND, on the SDGs, on the 2030 Agenda on sustainable development and on the Decisions of the Paris Agreement, particularly with regard to the rule book adopted at COP24 for call for greater vigilance on the impact of policies in the fight against climate change in order to prevent them from being to the detriment of women and vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>In all sectors and their projects working for adaptation to climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the Government of Burundi has the opportunity to lay a baseline on issues gender and social inclusion in terms of adaptation and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;</p>
<p>The agriculture, energy and infrastructure projects and programs included in this NDC are particularly called upon to systematically integrate gender and social inclusion aspects. They will inform and sensitize women, young people and the Batwa as actors in the reduction of greenhouse gases. Ongoing projects will build the capacities of women, youth and Batwa to drive change in practices and optimize integrated landscape management and the sustainable food value chain to increase adoption of resilient and improved production systems. </p>
<p>The projects will provide them with means and techniques to improve their standard of living, climate resilience and food security (income, use of energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases, improved stoves , solar energy, etc. During their execution, forestry projects and those relating to the restoration of land and ecosystems, vulnerable groups will benefit from special attention so that they become actors in the response-action collective for a sustainable fight against the advance of climate change instead of suffering the risks of disasters associated with it.</p>
<p>Suggestions from these groups will be collected for the development and implementation of projects and for community-based disaster risk management related to climate change. The traditional knowledge of the Batwa will be taken into consideration because they have a long experience of observation and commitment to their environment. For many years of interaction with their natural environment, they have developed strategies to respond to the impacts of climate change and have been able to respond to them thanks to their know-how and their philosophy of nature.</p>
<p>NDC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</p>
<p>Institutional aspects</p>
<p>An institutional framework for implementing the NDC exists in Burundi. It is under the supervision of the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock (MINEAGRIE) through the General Directorate of Environment, Water Resources and Sanitation. The latter is responsible for coordinating the implementation of sectoral policies on climate change.</p>
<p>Central administration services and public establishments (Geographical Institute of Burundi, IGEBU and Burundian Office for Environmental Protection, OBPE) provide support. The IGEBU and the OBPE are also respectively National Focal Point and Deputy National Focal Point of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Director General of Agriculture in the said Ministry is the Designated National Authority (DNA) for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) while the Permanent Secretary of MINEAGRIE serves as focal point for the Green Climate Fund. Global Environment (GEF).</p>
<p>In the context of climate change, the IGEBU is responsible for the collection, analysis, processing and dissemination of meteorological and hydrological data. As for the OBPE, its missions are: the implementation of policies and strategies on the environment and climate change and the establishment of mechanisms for mitigating and adapting to climate change (the work of the NAP).</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, it should be noted that other sectoral Ministries are concerned with issues related to climate change, which has a cross-cutting impact on all key sectors of the national economy. These are the Ministries in charge of Energy, Public Health, Commerce, Transport, Industry and Tourism. This is what justifies the need for a multi-sector and multi-disciplinary approach to ensure effective resilience.</p>
<p>Thus, the NDC 2020 recommends strengthening consultation between actors in the field in order to facilitate the harmonization of interventions and the mobilization of financial resources for the implementation of the NAPA and the NDC. To this end, like other countries in the sub-region and in the world, a National Climate Change Council, endowed with technical and financial capacities and high-level decision-making power, is essential for the needs coordination, consultation and mobilization of stakeholders involved at all levels as well as monitoring and evaluation of the state of implementation of the NDC.</p>
<p>At the technical level, a National Technical Committee on climate should be established and chaired by a parastatal agency like other structures of the Community of East African Countries. The creation and establishment of the National Council and the Technical Committee will be materialized by presidential decrees. The establishment of these structures will have to take into account all the actors and concern themselves with cross-cutting issues such as gender and social inclusion.</p>
<p>Legal framework</p>
<p>An impressive legal arsenal is based on the Constitution of Burundi of May 17, 2018, especially in its articles 164, paragraph 4 and article 35. It is supplemented by the following texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Law No. 1/10 of May 30, 2011 on the creation and management of protected areas in Burundi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law No. 1/010 of June 30, 2000 on the Environmental Code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law No. 1/07 of July 15, 2016, revising the Forest Code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law n°1/02 of March 26, 2012 on the water code in Burundi with regard to the qualitative (art.43 to 47) and quantitative protection of water resources (art.48 to 50). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law No. 1/13 of August 9, 2011 revising the land code of Burundi article 451 paragraph 1,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law n°1/13 of April 23, 2015 on the reorganization of the electricity sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law No. 1/012 of May 30, 2018 on the Code for the provision of health care and services in Burundi, especially in its articles 137 and 138</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decree-Law No. 100/241 of 31 December 1992 regulating the disposal of wastewater in urban areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decree No. 100/292 of October 16, 2007 on the creation, mission, composition, organization and functioning of the National Platform for Risk Prevention and Disaster Management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>6.3. Funding Mechanisms</p>
<p>The assessment of funding needs for actions to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change provided for in this NDC is based on the lists of programs and projects identified in progress or planned through the various sectors. An operational implementation strategy and its financing will enable the achievement of the NDC within the planned timeframe. The financing mechanisms have requirements to be met in terms of the quality of the projects to be presented, the data collected, the impact on mitigation or adaptation and the capacities of the management structures. Mastery of the technical, social and financial methods is a guarantee of success in capturing the attention of providers of the resources necessary for the implementation of the NDC.</p>
<p>7. MONITORING/EVALUATION AND MRV MECHANISMS</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the Ministry in charge of the Environment, the monitoring and evaluation of the NDC will be carried out by the sectoral technical services.</p>
<p>This will include, among other things, monitoring the implementation of the activities provided for in this contribution as well as the various indicators of the NDC.</p>
<p>A capacity building plan for the sectors concerned by MRV will be established in the NDC implementation strategy with the corresponding costs included in the cost of priority actions.</p>
<p>8. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Burundi considers its NDC to be fair and ambitious given its national situation and the way it contributes to the achievement of the objective of the Convention as set out in its article 2 of the Paris Agreement . In its participatory development process, all stakeholders were consulted and the criteria for prioritizing actions were based on the human and socio-environmental dimension. It shows specific commitments to reduce GHGs compared to projected emissions by 2030. The country is committed to respecting rules that guarantee environmental integrity, promote sustainable development and avoid double counting of emission reductions , in accordance with the rules to be adopted under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The successful implementation of the new NDC 2020 by all stakeholders requires significant financial, human and technological resources from the country, but also the support of the international community, in order to allow even more significant reductions in GHG emissions and resilience to climate change.</p>
