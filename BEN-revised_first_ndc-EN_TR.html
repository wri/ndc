<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with the relevant provisions of decision 1CP/21 adopting the Paris Agreement and paragraph 22 of decision 1CP/21 adopting the said agreement, Benin has prepared its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and submitted it to the Convention Secretariat in October 2017. The activities planned in the NDC covering the period 2017-2030 are structured into two main components, namely mitigation and adaptation. Following the completion of the inventory of the NDC in relation to the actions implemented over the period 2017-2019, Benin embarked on the process of updating this instrument with a view to raising the ambition included in the NDC and to provide more clarity and transparency for a better understanding of the instrument on the one hand and on the other hand for better monitoring of its implementation. With this in mind, Benin intends to show its firm determination to contribute more to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gases. This document, the elaboration of which benefited from the broad participation of the various stakeholders from public and private structures, local authorities and NGOs, constitutes Benin's updated NDC.</p>

<p><strong>1. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</strong></p>
<p>The Republic of Benin is located in West Africa between latitudes 6°30' and 12°30' North and longitudes 1° and 3°40' East, with an area of 114,763 km². Benin's population is estimated at 10,008,749 inhabitants (RGPH4, 2013) with an average annual population growth rate of around 3.52%. Administratively, Benin currently has twelve (12) departments subdivided into 77 Communes. There are mainly two types of climate in Benin, namely: the subequatorial climate characterizing the southern region and the continental tropical climate governing the northern region. On the socio-economic level, Benin experienced over the period 1996-2015 an unstable economic situation marked by a fluctuation of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) generally varying between 2 and 6%. But thanks to the economic reforms currently being carried out by the public authorities, GDP reached a record figure of 6.8% in 2018 (Source, IMF). However, GDP per capita growth remains low, due to sustained population growth, the poor performance of the policy implemented, thus leaving little margin for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. .</p>
<p>Awareness of the issues related to the problem of climate change has encouraged the development and adoption of several policies, strategies and response programs by Benin. On the legal level, it should be noted that with regard to climate change, a law regulating climate change in the Republic of Benin was voted by parliament on June 18, 2018 and promulgated on August 6, 2018. In terms of priorities and objectives of development, the Republic of Benin, has agreed, despite the bottlenecks that persist or existing challenges, commendable efforts particularly in terms of infrastructure development, security and governance. However, the level of operationalization of the existing strategies is still low to induce a significant evolution towards the realization of their respective visions and that of the National Studies of Long-Term Perspectives <strong>«</strong> Benin Alafia 2025 <strong>» .</strong> In terms of climate finance, Benin has created the National Environment and Climate Fund (FNEC) accredited by the Green Climate Fund (GCF).</p>

<p><strong>2. ATTENUATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.1 Current greenhouse gas emissions and business as usual projections</strong></p>
<p>Benin's total GHG emissions in 2018 amounted to approximately 16.94 Mega Ton CO2 Equivalent (Mt E-CO2), i.e. approximately 1.5 tonnes E-CO2 per capita, excluding the Land Use sector , Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). These emissions come from the sectors of energy (<strong>58.09%</strong>), agriculture (<strong>28.51%</strong>), waste (<strong>5.38 %</strong>) and industrial processes (<strong>1.22%</strong>) and other sectors (vegetation fires and HFC emissions) for <strong>6.80%</strong>. Taking into account the LULUCF sector, net GHG emissions amount to <strong>9.62</strong> Mt E-CO2.</p>
<p>In terms of projections, if the status quo scenario is maintained, the trend in global emissions (excluding LULUCF) reveals an increase of <strong>71%</strong> over the 2018-2030 period, changing by <strong>16.94</strong> Mt E-CO2 to <strong>29.02</strong> Mt E-CO2 (Figure 1). The total cumulative global GHG emissions without any intervention over the period 2021-2030 is around <strong>241.98</strong> Mt E-CO2 (LULUCF sector excluded). They come <strong>63.62%</strong> from the energy sector and <strong>24.04%</strong> from the agriculture sector, 1.21% from the IPUP sector, 4 .64% from the waste sector and other sectors (vegetation fire and HFC emissions), 6.49%.</p>
<p>For the years to come, the measures envisaged in the revised NDC, in the Energy, Agriculture and Waste sectors (see tables 5, 6, 7 and 8 below) are likely to contribute to reducing cumulative GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) of approximately <strong>48.75</strong> Mt E-CO2 compared to the reference scenario, i.e. a reduction of around <strong>20.15%</strong> over the period 2021-2030.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Climate Change Mitigation Goals and Actions</strong></p>
<p>Based on existing strategies, plans and programs, key sectoral objectives and actions for climate change mitigation are identified and recorded in Tables 3 to 5.</p>

<p><strong>2.3 Strategies, programs, implementation projects</strong></p>

<p>Implementation of sectoral mitigation activities (agriculture, energy, forestry and waste) under the NDC will build on existing strategies, programs and projects and future programs and projects.</p>

<p><strong>3. ADAPTATION</strong></p>
<p>In view of its membership of the group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), its environmental context and its development objectives, adaptation remains the priority for the Republic of Benin in terms of responding to climate change, although it adheres unconditionally to the global effort, directed towards the mitigation strategy.</p>

<p><strong>3.1 Vulnerability of Benin to climate change</strong></p>
<p>The assessment of Benin's vulnerability to climate change on behalf of the updated NDC is essentially based on the results of studies or assessments carried out in particular within the framework of the third national communication on climate change and the Technology Needs Assessment process, and development programs or projects aimed at adaptation objectives. Current major climate risks that impact livelihoods and livelihoods in particularly vulnerable sectors (Agriculture, Water Resources, Coastline, etc.) include floods, drought, late and violent rains, high winds, excessive heat and sea level rise. Impacts observed over the past three decades include declining agricultural yields, disruption of agricultural calendars, lower water levels in dams, supply of drinking water attributable to the increase in evaporation of the order of 3 to 4% on an annual scale (Houngue et al. 2019), the extension of the low water period (1 to 3 months), the flooding of banks, etc. In terms of future vulnerability, the assessments based on the new climate scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Representative profiles of the evolution of concentrations) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), show that the projections of annual precipitation made at different time horizons (2030, 2050) using the CSIRO and CCCMA models, show downward or upward changes depending on the model, but the dominant features remain the negative variations ( MCVDD , 2019). With regard to temperatures (average, minimum and maximum), the projections reveal an overall warming trend by 2030 and 2050. As for the potential impacts, they include sea level rise of up to around 0 .81m by 2100, with the direct effects of coastal flooding and the intrusion of saline water into watercourses and water tables. Which could affect human settlements, health, fishing activities (MEHU, 2011). One could also expect a probable decrease in surface water flows by 2050 over the entire Ouémé River basin in a scenario of reduced rainfall in the north of the country and a shift in flood periods in the Beninese portion of the Niger basin, following a significant drop in the rainfall regime on a seasonal scale (MEHU, 2011). In addition, the outlook points to a drop in maize yields (75-day SYN variety) of around 21.6% and 28.8% respectively by 2030 and 2050, a drop in cotton of around 0.9% in 2030 and 6.3% in 2050, and a prevalence of diseases, in particular foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants, lumpy skin disease and the spread of ticks of the genus Rhipicephalus Boophilus microplus, high rate of fish mortality and loss of ecological habitats for fish species.</p>

<p><strong>3.2 Objectives for adaptation to climate change</strong></p>
<p>Based on existing strategies, plans and programs, key sectoral objectives for climate change adaptation are defined for the time horizons 2025<strong>,</strong> 2030 and recorded in Table 8.</p>

<p><strong>3.3 Strategies, programs, implementation projects</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of adaptation activities at the level of the eight (8) sectors considered (agriculture, water resources, forestry, coastline, Tourism, Energy, Health, Urban Development and Infrastructure) under the updated NDC s will build on existing strategies, programs and projects and future programs and projects.</p>

<p><strong>4 FRAMEWORK FOR GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NDC</strong></p>
<p>The integration of the gender aspect in the implementation of the NDC seems extremely important in view of the role played by certain particularly vulnerable social strata, in this case women, in the fight against climate change. In this regard, the integration of the gender aspect in the updated NDC document is envisaged with a view to providing an overall overview of the possibilities of taking the gender aspect into account. Thus, it defines by sector and field of action the appropriate levels of consideration of the gender approach, accompanied by some recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>5 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NDC</strong></p>
<p>Benin's updated Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN) is implemented under the aegis of the Ministry of Living Environment and Sustainable Development (MCVDD), which acts as the national focal point for the Convention- United Nations Framework on Climate Change. Key players involved include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>relevant sectoral ministries and institutions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>local authorities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>private sector;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>civil society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementing bodies of this instrument are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Steering Committee,</strong> supreme decision-making and orientation body. It is made up of designated representatives of the Ministries concerned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>National Coordination Unit</strong> of the CDN which is the unifying body for all actions. It includes the Director General in charge of Climate Change (DGEC), the National Coordinator, the Focal Point of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Focal Point for the Transfer of Climate Technologies, an Executive Secretary; two technical assistants to the National Coordinator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sectoral coordination</strong> of implementation within the ministries, institutions, agencies and other structures covered by the measures/actions retained in the updated NDC. They are made up of officials in charge of programming and forecasting at the level of the ministries, officials in charge of project monitoring and evaluation, the climate change focal point of the National Association of Municipalities of Benin, the official in charge of questions relating climate change at the umbrella level of civil societies and non-governmental organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The municipal coordination,</strong> body responsible for supervising the NDC at the municipal/local level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the implementation of the projects and programs identified at the level of the various sectors covered by the NDC is the responsibility of the ministries, institutions or sectoral entities concerned.</p>
<p>The necessary guidance and facilities will be provided by the MCVDD to support sectoral structures as needed in the preparation of funding research files or any other initiatives through existing mechanisms. The MCVDD will also be responsible for the MRV system (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) of the implementation of the NDC, institutional capacity building in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>6 MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p>
<p>The activities planned as part of the implementation of Benin's updated NDC require financial, technological and capacity building resources.</p>
<p>With regard to technological resources, emphasis will be placed on endogenous technologies and South-South and North-South transfer, including the necessary know-how. The main technology transfer needs identified concern the agriculture, water resources, forestry and energy sectors (tables 14 and 15).</p>
<p>Capacity building will consist of developing technical skills and improving institutional capacities.</p>
<p>The Republic of Benin, to achieve its greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation ambitions, will need an overall financial envelope of the order of <strong>8556.81</strong> million dollars US including <strong>5069.03</strong> million as a contribution from the Government of Benin and the private sector and <strong>3487.77</strong> million to be mobilized from the international community over the period from 2021 to 2030. The cost relating to the implementation of sectoral adaptation programs and projects is estimated at approximately <strong>1796.13</strong> million US dollars, of which the national contribution (unconditional share) is of the order of <strong >578.47</strong> million US dollars while the conditional part (international support) corresponds to <strong>1217.66</strong> million US dollars. In addition, the financial resources to be mobilized for the implementation of the mitigation/adaptation measures of municipal projects amount overall to <strong>162.94</strong> million US dollars, of which approximately <strong>14 .39</strong> million US dollars for the national contribution and <strong>148.55</strong> million US dollars for the conditional part.</p>
<p>In total, the financial resources to be mobilized for the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures under this first updated Benin NDC amount overall to approximately <strong>10515.88</strong> million US dollars to come from public funds, the private sector and international support. This amount is divided into an unconditional contribution of approximately <strong>5,661.89</strong> million US dollars, i.e. <strong>53.8%, and</strong> a conditional contribution of approximately <strong>4,853 .99</strong> million US dollars or approximately <strong>46.2%.</strong></p>

<p><strong>7 CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADAPTATION STRATEGIES AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS</strong></p>
<p>The successful implementation of the NDC could be confronted with many constraints, among which it should be noted: the effective and timely mobilization of national and external resources, the capacity of the public structures concerned to effectively manage programs of scales, the effectiveness of the application of regulatory texts, the effective transfer of technologies as well as the completion of research and development work at the national level.</p>

<p><strong>I. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</strong></p>
<p>The Republic of Benin is located in West Africa between latitudes 6°30' and 12°30' North and longitudes 1° and 3°40' East, with an area of 114,763 km². It is bordered to the South by the Atlantic Ocean, to the West by Togo, to the East by Nigeria, to the North-East by Niger and to the North-West by Burkina-Faso. Benin's population is estimated at 10,008,749 inhabitants (RGPH4, 2013) with an average annual population growth rate of around 3.52%. The average density is 29 inhabitants/km2 with a greater demographic concentration noted in the south of the country. Administratively, Benin currently has twelve (12) departments subdivided into 77 Communes.</p>
<p>In Benin, there are mainly two types of climate, namely: the subequatorial climate characterizing the southern region and the continental tropical climate governing the northern region. Average annual rainfall varies between 700 mm (extreme North) and 1500 mm (extreme South-East), while air temperatures vary on average around 27.2°C, with absolute maximums that can exceed 45°C. to the North.</p>
<p>The last two decades have been particularly marked by an increase in climate variability characterized in particular by a recurrence of extreme meteorological phenomena (floods in particular), the disruption of seasonal rainfall patterns and an increasingly remarkable reduction in the number of events rainy. With regard to air temperature, the deviations from normal (1981-2010) of the annual averages show values oscillating between -0.7 and +1.3°C.</p>
<p> On the socio-economic level, Benin experienced an unstable economic situation over the period 1996-2015 marked by a fluctuation in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) varying globally between 2 and 6%. But thanks to the economic reforms currently being carried out by the public authorities, GDP reached a record figure of 6.8% in 2018 (Source, IMF). However, GDP per capita growth remains low, due to sustained population growth, the poor performance of the policy implemented, thus leaving little margin for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the horizon. 2030.</p>
<p>The governance of climate change at the national level is primarily the mission of the Ministry of Living Environment and Sustainable Development (MCVDD), ensuring the role of National Focal Point of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Climate (UNFCCC). It coordinates and supervises, through the Directorate General for Environment and Climate (DGEC), the processes for developing national communications on climate change, Nationally Determined Contributions (CDN) and other documents relating to climate change. implementation of the Convention. It works closely with structures under the other ministerial departments concerned and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).</p>
<p>At the political level, one of the instruments of major importance is the National Development Plan 2016-2025, adopted in July 2018. Awareness of the issues related to the problem of climate change has encouraged the development and the adoption of several policies, strategies and response programs by Benin. These are: the National Strategy for the implementation of the UNFCCC, the National Action Program for the purposes of Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA), the National Program for the Sustainable Management of Natural Resources (PNGDRN), the Low-Carbon and Climate Change Resilient Development Strategy, the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Sustainable Management of Benin's Mangrove Ecosystems and the CDN in particular.</p>
<p>From a legal point of view, it should be noted that in terms of climate change, a law regulating climate change in the Republic of Benin was passed by parliament on June 18, 2018 and promulgated on August 6, 2018.</p>
<p>In terms of development priorities and objectives, the Republic of Benin, despite the bottlenecks that persist or existing challenges, has made commendable efforts, particularly in terms of infrastructure development, security and governance. However, the level of operationalization of the existing strategies is still low to induce a significant evolution towards the realization of their respective visions and that of the National Studies of Long-Term Perspectives <strong>«</strong> Benin Alafia 2025 <strong>» .</strong> With regard to climate finance, Benin has created the National Environment and Climate Fund (FNEC) accredited by the Green Climate Fund (GCF).</p>

<p><strong>II. ATTENUATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.1 Current greenhouse gas emissions and business as usual projections</strong></p>
<p>Data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are based on the results of estimates made using sectoral activity data from the TCN, which have been updated with the following tools:</p >

<p>i) the LEAP (Low Emissions Analysis Platform) software for the Energy and Waste sectors and the category of rice growing in the agriculture sector;</p>

<p>ii) the EX-ACT (EX-Ante Carbon-balance Tool) software for the agriculture sector (except rice cultivation);</p>

<p>In the other land use forestry sector, the estimation of Gas emissions for the reference scenario and the assessment of the mitigation scenario were carried out using the Excel spreadsheet using the guidelines of the IPCC with the exception of measures targeting the development of cashew and oil palm plantations, the effects of which have been assessed using the Ex-act tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the national level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Benin's total GHG emissions in 2018 amounted to approximately 16.94 Mega tonnes CO2 equivalent (Mt E-CO2), i.e. approximately <strong>1.5 tonnes E-CO</strong>2 <strong>per capita</strong>, Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector excluded. These emissions come from the energy (63%), agriculture (28.6%), waste (5.3%) and industrial processes (3.1%) sectors. Taking into account the LULUCF sector, net GHG emissions amount to 10.6 Mt E-CO2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Projected greenhouse gas emissions if business as usual</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the status quo is maintained, the trend in global <strong>annual</strong> emissions (excluding LULUCF) shows a growth rate of approximately <strong>71%</strong> over the 2018 period -2030 by evolving from <strong>16.94</strong> Mt E-CO2 to <strong>29.02</strong> Mt E-CO2. Figure 1 shows the annual GHG emissions trajectories for the agriculture, energy, waste and industrial process sectors. The total <strong>cumulative</strong> global GHG emissions without any intervention over the period 2021-2030 is around <strong>241.98</strong> Mt E-CO2 (LULUCF sector excluded). They come <strong>63.62%</strong> from the energy sector and <strong>24.04%</strong> from the agriculture sector, 1.21% from the IPUP sector, 4 .64% from the waste sector and other sectors (vegetation fire and HFC emissions), 6.49%.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Historical Non-GHG SLCP and Air Pollutant Emissions and Projections Under Business as Usual</strong></p>
<p>The emissions for each pollutant (other than GHG) individually between 2010 and 2018 are as follows (Table 1). The amount of black carbon emitted into the atmosphere in Benin in 2018 is estimated at 10 thousand tons. The primary sources of black carbon emissions are residential combustion, wildfires, and charcoal production, along with other particulate air pollutants (Figure 2).</p>

<p>General methodology for estimating emissions</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>For the generation of scenarios in the various sectors and sub-sectors targeted for the mitigation component, GHG emissions were estimated over the historical period from 2010 to 2016 and the projections from 2017 to 2030. Four types of data were used. used: demographic data, macroeconomic data (GDP), sectoral activity data, emission factors and the global warming potentials of the various gases.</p>
<p>Demographic and economic data are taken from statistics and projections of the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INStaD).</p>
<p>The activity data comes from official statistical documents and databases from the various sectors concerned. Missing data and data projections required extrapolations and sometimes approximations based on assumptions established and widely shared with stakeholders at sector level.</p>
<p>For GHGs, the emission factors used are mostly default values from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. CH4 emission factors from enteric fermentation and cattle manure management are specific to Benin.</p>
<p>Emission factors for SLCPs other than GHGs and air pollutants are taken from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, Air Pollutant Emission Inventory Guidebook 2019 (EMEP/EEA, 2019 ) and Andreae and Merlet (2001).</p>
<p>Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) are values provided by the IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report: 1 for CO2, 25 for CH4 and 298 for N2O.</p>
<p>Global emissions are assessed from the sum of sectoral emissions excluding the LULUCF sector.</p>

<p>The reference scenario, as indicated above, is the one according to which GHG emissions are produced in the absence of the actions adopted from 2017 likely to contribute to the mitigation of GHG emissions or the enhancement of sinks of carbon. Thus, for this scenario, the estimate of emissions over the period 2017 to 2030 is based on projections of sectoral activity data from historical trends observed over the years 2010 to 2017.</p>

<p>Period from 2017 to 2019: It appears from the inventory of the implementation of the NDC during the preparatory phase that the mitigation actions undertaken in the sectors of agriculture and energy from 2017 to 2019 have reduced GHG emissions by 3.8 Mt E-CO2, i.e. 2.4% of the target set for 2030 already achieved</p>
<p>In the forestry sector, actions to restore degraded natural forests and forest plantations resulted in the absorption of <strong>1.155 Mt E-CO</strong>2 over the period indicated above. .</p>
<p>Period from 2021 to 2030: For the years to come, the measures envisaged in the revised NDC, in the Energy, Agriculture and Waste sectors are likely to contribute to reducing cumulative GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) by approximately 48 .75 Mt E CO2 compared to the reference scenario, i.e. a reduction of 20.15% over the period 2021-2030 (Table 3 and Figure 3). In relation to SLCPs (other than GHGs) and atmospheric pollutants, 12 measures have been considered in the Energy sector and are likely to contribute to reducing black carbon emissions by approximately 1.8 Mt in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, i.e. a reduction of 14.2% (Table 4)</p>

<p>The implementation of the mitigation measures included in this updated version of Benin's NDC supports the revision of Benin's overall GHG reduction objective, namely a reduction in cumulative GHG emissions (excluding forestry ) between 2021 and 2030 by 48.75 Mt E-CO2, i.e. 20.15% compared to the cumulative emissions of the reference scenario (Table 3). Figure 3 shows the trajectories of GHG emissions in each of the scenarios between 2021 and 2030: the reference scenario, the unconditional mitigation scenario (based on the unconditional measures) and the overall mitigation scenario (based on the unconditional measures and conditionals). The mitigation measures that are included in each scenario are presented in tables 5, 6, 7 and 8 below. Benin also observes that the implementation of these mitigation measures, in addition to reducing GHGs, would also result in local benefits with respect to exposure to air pollution and human health by reducing emissions of climate pollutants. short-lived black carbon, and other health-damaging air pollutants. Implementing the mitigation measures would reduce black carbon emissions in 2030 by 14% relative to baseline black carbon emissions, as well as significant reductions in other pollutants (Table 4).</p>

<p>III. AMBITION AND EQUITY</strong></p>
<p>The objective of reducing cumulative emissions over the period 2021 to 2030 of <strong>20.15%</strong> based on measures is fair in view of Benin's low contribution to global emissions, its low level of development and its socio-economic fragility. The Republic of Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world whose GHG emissions are estimated at around <strong>16.93</strong> Mt E-CO2 in 2018, i.e. around 1.5 tonnes E-CO2 per inhabitant. Its economic performance remains weak and unstable with a critical financial situation. The average real GDP growth rate (4.7% from 2015 to 2020) is lower than the 7% growth rate, the minimum necessary to sustainably fight against poverty. The country depends on the outside for its supply of commercial energies (petroleum products and electricity).</p>
<p>Benin's commitment is ambitious given that its reduction targets relate to key sectors for its economic development, in particular the energy and agriculture sectors, whose emissions cover 91.6% of global emissions from the country. Benin's aspiration to economic development and the growth of its population would induce a trend growth in its energy needs. Thus, GHG emissions from the agriculture and energy sectors are expected to increase continuously. One of the major challenges will be the promotion of low-carbon development at both sectoral and local level.</p>

<p><strong>IV. ADAPTATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>4.1 Vulnerability of Benin to climate change</strong></p>
<p>In terms of current vulnerability, the major climate risks that impact modes and livelihoods in the agricultural, water resources, coastal and forestry sectors are drought, floods, late heavy rains, high winds, excessive heat and sea level rise.</p>
<p>The manifestations of the above-mentioned climatic risks have generated numerous impacts over the past three decades, in this case the drop in agricultural yields, the disruption of agricultural calendars, the drop in water levels in the dams of drinking water supply, extension of the low water period, flooding of the banks, etc.</p>
<p>With regard to future vulnerability, the climate risks to which natural and human systems could be exposed are part of a scenario of persistence or accentuation of the risks currently observed and depend on the sector considered. The potential impacts, according to climate projections for the time horizons 2025, 2050 and 2100, range from coastal flooding and saline water intrusion in watercourses and water tables to a drop in maize yields in certain agro-ecological zones (ZAE5 in particular) in passing through a shift in flood periods in the Beninese portion of the Niger basin.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Climate Change Adaptation Goals</strong></p>

<p>Based on existing strategies, plans and programs, key sectoral climate change adaptation goals are defined for the time horizons 2020, 2025<strong>,</strong>2030 and recorded in Table 9 .</p>

<p><strong>V. STRATEGIES, PROGRAMS, PROJECTS AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>5.1 Implementation of sectoral activities</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of the sectoral activities planned in the NDC will be based on existing and future strategies, programs and projects (tables 10, 11, 12 and 13). Therefore, the competent sectoral structures are committed to taking this into account in the design of future programs and projects.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some mitigation projects listed in Table 10 have co-benefits with adaptation and vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>5.3. Institutional framework for the implementation of the updated NDC</strong></p>

<p>The implementation of Benin's updated Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN) is done under the aegis of the Ministry of Living Environment and Sustainable Development (MCVDD) acting as National Focal Point of the Framework Convention United Nations on Climate Change. Key players involved include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>relevant sectoral ministries and institutions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>local authorities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>private sector;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>civil society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementing bodies of this instrument are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Steering Committee, supreme decision-making and orientation body. It is made up of designated representatives of the Ministries concerned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Coordination Unit of the CDN which is the unifying body for all actions. It includes the Director General in charge of Climate Change (DGEC), the National Coordinator, the Focal Point of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Focal Point for the Transfer of Climate Technologies, an Executive Secretary; two technical assistants to the National Coordinator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sectoral coordination of implementation under the ministries, institutions, agencies and other structures covered by the measures/actions retained in the updated NDC. They are made up of officials in charge of programming and forecasting at the level of ministries, officials in charge of project monitoring and evaluation, the climate change focal point of the National Association of Municipalities of Benin, the official in charge of questions relating climate change at the umbrella level of civil societies and non-governmental organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The municipal coordination, body responsible for supervising the NDC at the municipal/local level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the implementation of the projects and programs identified at the level of the various sectors covered by the NDC is the responsibility of the ministries, institutions or sectoral entities concerned.</p>
<p>The necessary guidance and facilities will be provided by the MCVDD to support sectoral structures as needed in the preparation of funding research files or any other initiatives through existing mechanisms. The MCVDD will also be responsible for the MRV system (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) of the implementation of the NDC, institutional capacity building in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders. The organizational structure for implementing the updated NDC is shown in Figure 6 below.</p>

<p>VI. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p>

<p>The implementation plan provided for in Benin's updated NDC is presented in Annex 3. The implementation of these activities requires financial, technological and capacity building resources.</p>

<p><strong>6.1. Technology Transfer Needs</strong></p>
<p>The needs expressed in terms of technology transfer on behalf of the ADAPTATION and Mitigation Component mainly come from the assessments carried out within the framework of the Third National Communication (MCVDD, 2019) on climate change (October 2019) and the report on priority adaptation technologies, developed under the Technology Needs Assessment Project - Technology Action Plan (TNA-Adaptation, 2020 & TNA_Mitigation, 2020). They cover the agriculture and resources sectors. in water for the adaptation component on the one hand and the agriculture, forestry and energy sectors for the mitigation component (see table 15 and 16)</p>

<p><strong>6.3 Funding</strong></p>

<p>National resources (public funds and private investments) will be complemented by external financial support (bilateral or multilateral). The total estimated cost for the execution of the plans, programs and projects listed under Benin's updated NDC amounts globally to <strong>10,515.88</strong> million US dollars, of which <strong>5,661.89</strong> million US dollars in unconditional option and <strong>4853.99</strong> million US dollars in conditional option (Appendices 1 and 2). Of this total, the cost relating to local community projects included in the implementation of the updated NDC is estimated globally at <strong>162.94</strong> million US dollars with an unconditional share of <strong> 14.39</strong> million US dollars and <strong>148.55</strong> million of conditional dollars (appendix 3). This estimate is based on the country's current experiences in implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.</p>
<p>In order to measure the progress made in the implementation of the said activities, a Measurement, Notification and Verification (MRV) system will be set up at the MCVDD in conjunction with the other ministries and municipalities involved in the NDC. </p>

<p><strong>6.4. Conditions for successful implementation of the NDC</strong></p>
<p>The successful implementation of the NDC will depend on the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The effective and timely mobilization of national resources and the assistance expected from the international community. Difficulties in mobilizing sufficient resources could hamper project implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The capacity of the public structures concerned to effectively manage large-scale programmes. To prevent any difficulty that may arise from the lack of capacity of these structures, it will be necessary to make a good diagnosis at the sectoral level of the staffing needs for the implementation of the projects on time; and this within the framework of the development of the institutional capacity building program provided for in the NDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effectiveness of the implementation of regulatory texts and control of the national market for imported electrical equipment and household appliances and the success of operations to promote energy efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The capacity of the agricultural sector to effectively promote improved farming techniques on the planned areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effectiveness of technology transfer as well as the completion of research and development work at the national level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strict monitoring of a master plan for the implementation of the updated NDC at the level of the coordination team on the one hand and in all the sectoral ministries concerned on the other hand.</p>
