  <h1>Bangladesh's NDC</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Paris Agreement (PA) was adopted by COP21 in 2015, and subsequently signed and ratified by 191 Parties. The sole aim is to change the current course towards combating climate change, harboring sustainable development pathway by limiting global warming within 1.5 - 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. One of the key elements of the PA is the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) previously referred to as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) before the ratification of PA. Bangladesh submitted its INDC to UNFCCC on 25 September 2015, for three sectors (Power, Industry and Transport). Subsequently, Bangladesh prepared the NDC Implementation Roadmap and Action Plan in 2018.</p>
<p>Bangladesh&rsquo;s INDC proposed for 12 million tons (5%) unconditional reduction in GHG emission from Business as Usual (BAU) scenario by 2030 and a further 24 million tons (10%) conditional reduction in GHG emission with support from the international community taking the base year 2011.</p>
<p>As part of the global initiative, Bangladesh is updating the NDC incorporating additional sectors following IPCC guidelines. The updated NDC covers Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry and other Land use (AFOLU) and Waste. For the NDC update, 2012 has been considered as the base year following the Third National Communication of Bangladesh, which details a comprehensive national GHG emission inventory for 2012.</p>
<p>In this NDC update, information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of Bangladesh&rsquo;s NDC in line with the guidelines set out in Katowice decisions (COP24/CMA1) is presented in the form of template in the last part of this document.</p>
<p>The NDC update aims to further mitigation actions that Bangladesh may take to tackle its growing emissions and play its role in global efforts. The NDC calls for a number of mitigation actions that will help limit the country&rsquo;s GHG emissions. These actions will play a key role in realizing the move to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and becoming a middle-income country whilst ensuring that it will not cross the average per capita emissions of the developing countries.</p>
<h1>Base Year and Future Emission Scenario</h1>
<p>As part of the global initiative, Bangladesh is updating its NDC. This updated NDC covers Energy (Power, transport, energy use in industry, residential, commercial, agriculture and brick manufacturing, F-gases and Fugitive emission), Industrial Processes &amp; Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry and other Land use (AFOLU) and Waste sectors. In this aspect, the NDC is incorporating additional sectors according to IPCC guidelines to ensure comprehensive coverage. So, the Updated NDC tries to represent an economy-wide GHG emission reduction taking in to account lack of required information under AFOLU. The updated NDC is prepared following a structured process involving stakeholders from relevant ministries and agencies. The required data has been collected through IPCC suggested structured template from the agencies on present condition and future plans and projects relevant to GHG emission reduction. Following this, the initial scenario analysis outcomes have been validated with the relevant ministries and agencies in a validation workshop. The possible mitigation measures have been finalized based on discussion on the validation process.</p>
<h2>Base Year Scenario</h2>
<p>For the NDC update, 2012 has been considered for the base year following the Third National Communication of Bangladesh, detailing a comprehensive national GHG emission inventory for 2012. Energy, IPPU, AFOLU and Waste Sectors are considered for GHG emission inventory preparation.</p>
<p>Power, Transport and Industry are three major sub-sectors under the Energy Sector, while Brick manufacturing, Residential and commercial buildings (energy use), Energy use in Agriculture activities (pumps, tractors, harvester etc.) and fish farms, F-gases (HCFC use) in air conditioning and refrigeration and Fugitive emission from gas transmission and distribution systems, flaring in oil/ gas fields etc. are considered as other sub-sectors of the Energy Sector.</p>
<p>The Power sub-sector includes emissions from electricity generation activities from coal, gas, furnace oil-based power plants and different renewable energy sources such as solar home system, solar park, solar mini &amp; micro grid, rooftop solar and net metering, solar irrigation, hydro, wind, biomass and biogas. Transport sub-sector comprises fuel combustion emission from the road, rail and inland water transport. Industry sub-sector covers energy use in industry covering fuel and electricity use in industrial activities.</p>
<p>The IPPU sector covers industrial process based emissions from cement clinker production and urea fertilizer production. The AFOLU (agriculture) sub-sector covers methane emission from cultivated rice fields, nitrous oxide emission from nitrogen-based fertilizer, methane emission from enteric fermentation of livestock and methane and emission from manure management. The AFOLU (forestry) sub-sector covers emissions from forest areas and carbon stock in Bangladesh. The Waste sector covers methane emission from solid waste disposal and domestic wastewater.</p>
<p>For the base year, total GHG emission accounts for 169.05 million tons CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e). Energy Sector holds the higher contribution to the total GHG emission which is 93.09 Mt CO2e or 55.07% of the total, followed by AFOLU (27.35% of total), Waste (14.26% of total) and IPPU (3.32% of total) Sectors.</p>
<p>Power, Transport, Industry, Household and Brick Kilns are five major sub-sectors which contributes most (total 82.62 Mt CO2e) to the Energy Sector emission. At the same time, Commercial, Agriculture, Fugitive and F-Gases sub-sectors generate the remaining. Similarly, the Agriculture sub-sector under the AFOLU Sector generates the highest 45.87 MtCO2e, about 27.13% of the total GHG emission for the base scenario. According to IPCC guidelines for Forestry sub-sector, Bangladesh has established a Forest Reference Level (FRL) for the historical reference period 2000-2015. The estimated emission from the forestry sector is 1.19 MtCO2e/year, and the estimated removal is 0.81 MtCO2e/year. The net change, FRL, is 0.37 MtCO2e/year. Waste and IPPU Sector generates 24.11 and 5.61 MtCO2e emission respectively.</p>
<p>The following table 1 presents the sector-wise GHG emission for the Base year scenario.</p>

<p>The base year GHG emission scenario for 2012, has been updated with additional information for Fugitive emission from leakages in the gas distribution network, F-gases, gas and electricity use in households. This information was not included in the TNC. So, there is an increase in total emission from 152.27 MtCO2e to 169. 05 MtCO2e.</p>
<h2>Business As Usual Scenario</h2>
<p>The BAU scenario is prepared considering the contribution of emission sources and information that has been collected from the relevant agencies of different ministries following the IPCC 2006 reporting guidelines. The BAU scenario does not contain any mitigative measures. The BAU scenario has been modeled following the use of conventional technology and national projections of development.</p>
<p>Critical assumptions for modelling GHG emission for BAU scenarios are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the energy sector, BAU is prepared following the Power Sector Master Plan (2016) with additional modifications of plans from the Ministry of Power and mineral resources; Energy Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan (2015) for industry, residential and commercial; previous trend-based projection for Transport; Brick sector roadmap and Department of Environment information on Brick manufacturing, National Cooling Action Plan and Montreal protocol targets for F-gases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the IPPU sector, previous trends and demand-based projections have been made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In AFOLU sector, BAU is prepared following rice cropping area and livestock population projection for 2030 from relevant Ministries and agencies; Forestry related emission is taken from Bangladesh&rsquo;s Forest Reference Level (FRL) and kept as constant. No mitigation scenario analysis was carried out for Other Land Use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BAU is prepared based on the extrapolation of waste generation using urban population estimates (UN data) and waste generation rate (Third National Communication) in the Waste sector.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total GHG emission is found to be increased from 169.05 Mt CO2e in 2012 to 409.4 Mt CO2e in 2030 under the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario with an increase of 2.4 times than base year. The following table 2 presents the sector-wise distribution of the GHG emission for the BAU scenario in 2030.</p>
<p>The sector-wise emissions under BAU scenario by 2030 are 312.54 Mt CO2e (76.34% of total) in Energy, 10.97 Mt CO2e (2.68% of total) in IPPU, 55.01 Mt CO2e (13.44% of total) in AFOLU and 30.89 Mt CO2e (7.55% of total) in Waste Sectors.</p>
<p>The highest contribution (24.91% of total) of GHG emission is found for Industry (energy) sub- sector followed by Power (23.24% of total) and Transport (8.86% of total) under the Energy Sector.</p>

<h1>Mitigation Action</h1>
<p>The mitigation scenario analysis and assessment of achievable but ambitious unconditional and conditional GHG mitigation measures by 2030 for the NDC update has been prepared following IPCC guidelines and stakeholder consultation. In the unconditional part of NDC, only those mitigation measures were considered which would be implemented based on current local-level capacity, and financed through internal resources. Contingent upon international funding and technological support, the conditional emission reduction will be implemented. The following sections present the updated unconditional and conditional contributions.</p>
<h2>Unconditional Contribution</h2>
<p>In the unconditional scenario, GHG emissions would be reduced by <strong>27.56 Mt CO</strong>2<strong>e (6.73%) below BAU in 2030 </strong>in the respective sectors. 26.3 Mt CO2e (95.4%) of this emission reduction will be from the Energy sector while 0.64 (2.3%) and 0.6 (2.2%) Mt CO2e reduction will be from AFOLU (agriculture) and waste sector respectively. There will be no reduction in the IPPU sector.</p>
<h2>Conditional Contribution</h2>
<p>In the conditional scenario, GHG emissions would be reduced by <strong>61.9 Mt CO</strong>2<strong>e (15.12%) below </strong><strong>BAU in 2030 </strong>in the respective sectors. This reduction is in addition to the proposed reductions in unconditional scenario. The conditional mitigation measures will be implemented by Bangladesh, only if there is external financial/technology support. The conditional scenario has 59.7Mt CO2e (96.46%) emission reduction from the Energy sector, while 0.4 (0.65%) and 1.84 (2.97%) Mt CO2e reduction will be from AFOLU (agriculture) and Waste Sector respectively. There will be no reduction in the IPPU Sector. Table 3 presents the GHG reduction under unconditional and conditional scenarios.</p>

<p>This contribution is based on the analysis carried out in 2020-21 using the best available data. However data quality and availability is an issue in Bangladesh. If new and more robust data comes to light in the future, or if assumptions change (e.g. projections of population or economic growth) the government will update its analysis accordingly. This will be coordinated with the National Communication and Biennial Update Report reporting cycle.</p>
<h1>Potential Actions</h1>
<h2>Unconditional Contribution</h2>
<p>The targeted GHG emission reduction for unconditional contributions will be implemented through a set of mitigation actions. The potential mitigations actions are elaborated in Table 4.</p>

<p>Along with these measures, a set of initiatives will be undertaken for IPPU Sector. However, no GHG emission reduction is committed for this Sector. The potential mitigation measures in IPPU sector includes switching to more efficient industrial processes in fertilizer and cement manufacturing. The cement factories can switch to technologies like vertical roller mills, resulting in energy savings. In fertilizer manufacturing, one Industry has been established with the modern and efficient process, and a few more are in the pipeline.</p>
<h1>Achievements and Initiatives<h1>
<h2>Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan up to 2030</h2>
<p>Bangladesh has assumed the presidency of the 48-nation Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the Vulnerable Twenty (V20) Group of Finance Ministers. Honorable Prime Minister of Bangladesh H.E. Sheikh Hasina is serving as Chair of the CVF since June 2020. As Chair of the CVF, Honorable Prime Minister has launched a program to develop &ldquo;Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan&rdquo; for Bangladesh. The Plan will be the first of CVF plans, with a strategic investment framework to mobilize financing, especially through international cooperation, for implementing renewable energy and climate resilience initiatives. The Draft plan identifies several key initiatives, which focus in renewable energy, energy storage infrastructure, power grid modernization, Established carbon market regime, Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 resilience bonds, training and skills development for future, Future-proof Bangladesh&rsquo;s industries, locally-led adaptation outcomes, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise financial protection and productivity enhancement, Climate-Resilient and Nature-Based agricultural and fisheries development, environment friendly transport, climate resilient well-being programs and Accelerated digital revolution.</p>
<h2>Ashrayan: Shelter for the Homeless and Landless</h2>
<p>The government is implementing the shelter project for landless and homeless people. Under the project, 442,608 families have been rehabilitated in 22640 barracks and 0.26 million houses. Additionally, 4,409 climate refugee families are being rehabilitated in Khuruskul, Cox&rsquo;s Bazar. Besides enhancing disaster resilience, the project also focuses on mitigation through implementing 1.58 million tree plantations, rainwater harvesting, Solar Home System based alternate power sources, improved cook stoves etc. Besides this, 50,104 families have been rehabilitated by the Cluster village project, where 0.455 million trees have been planted.</p>
<h2>National Solar Energy Roadmap, 2021-2041</h2>
<p>The National Solar Energy Roadmap, 2021 - 2041 has been drafted to frame a long-term vision for the nation and set possible capacity targets for the country&rsquo;s solar energy initiative. This outline the broader strategies required to achieve those targets. Based on three implementation scenarios, the Roadmap delineates a few general as well as specific and time-bound measures to achieve that target by the year 2041.</p>
<h2>National Action Plan for Clean Cooking, 2020-2030</h2>
<p>Bangladesh&rsquo;s Country Action Plan for Clean Cook Stoves 2013 (CAP 2013) focused predominantly on the removal of existing financing barriers by enabling access to capital by SMEs, promoting access to climate funds, leveraging government funds to finance women-led businesses in the sector and lobbying for additional financing options from international donors at low rates. About 4.5 million improved cook stoves have been distributed already. A new National Action Plan for Clean Cooking in Bangladesh (2020-2030) is being formulated following its success.</p>
<h2>Forest and Carbon Inventories and Tree Plantation</h2>
<p>Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD) conducted National Forest Inventory (NFI) during 2016-2019 to identify the status of forest and tree resources, carbon and biomass stock, dependency of local people on trees and forests and the ecology. The government has developed the Forest Reference Level (FRL) and Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) and submitted them to the UNFCCC. To reduce the carbon emission from the forestry sector, Bangladesh formulated Bangladesh National REDD+ Strategy (BNRS). It established a National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) for periodical monitoring of tree and forest cover. To celebrate the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, BFD has planted 10 million tree saplings around Bangladesh. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief has planted 5.4 million Palm trees which will contribute to carbon sink and reduce the risk of death due to lightning.</p>
<h2>Bangladesh National Action Plan for Reducing Short-Lived Climate Pollutants</h2>
<p>The NAP-SLCPs were formulated with support from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition in February 2012 to reduce SLCPs. The plan focuses on identifying and implementing the most cost-effective measures for large-scale implementation of SLCP mitigation. Eleven priority mitigation measures were included in the SLCP Plan, six of which target primary black carbon sources, while the rest five target major methane sources. The plan&rsquo;s full implementation is expected to reduce black carbon emissions by 40% and methane emission by 17% in 2030 compared to a business as usual (BAU) scenario.</p>
<h2>Energy Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan up to 2030</h2>
<p>Under this comprehensive plan, the government aims to lower energy intensity (national primary energy consumption per unit of GDP) in 2030 by 20% compared to the 2013 level. A total of 95 million toe (113 billion m3 of gas equivalent) is expected to be saved during the period.</p>
<h2>Renewable Energy Initiatives</h2>
<p>Bangladesh has taken up a number of initiatives to enhance the best utilization of renewable energy. Bangladesh has installed more than 6 million solar-home systems (SHSs) across the country benefiting more than 18 million (11%) population. Around 66 MW is being produced through roof top solar panels installed in government and private buildings. 2226 solar irrigation systems have been installed around the country. The government has extended a re-financing scheme to finance alternative energy generation projects like small scale solar and micro grids, to improve energy access in off- grid areas.</p>
<h2>Promoting Green Technology</h2>
<p>Bangladesh Bank established a refinance scheme to support environment-friendly technology such as solar energy, bio-gas plants, and Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP). The initial projcts focused on only 10 products, which has increased to 50 products under 11 categories: renewable energy, energy efficiency, solid waste management, liquid waste management, alternative energy, fire burnt brick, non-fire block brick, recycling and recyclable product, ensuring safety in work environment of factories, etc. 39 banks and 19 financial institutions have signed a participation agreement with Bangladesh Bank to avail finance from this scheme.</p>
<h2>Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund</h2>
<p>The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) has undertaken 800 projects with an investment of 449.3 million USD to implement strategic actions of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), which mainly focus on adaptation, mitigation and climate change research.</p>
<h2>Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100</h2>
<p>The government has recently adopted the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, a comprehensive 100-year strategic plan aimed at gradual sustainable development through adaptive delta management process. The Delta plan has included climate change as a significant future challenge. It reaffirms Bangladesh&rsquo;s commitment to reducing GHG emissions from key sectors through efforts like promoting improved rice parboiling systems and ensure energy efficiency, research on the suitability of various tree species for their carbon-locking properties suitable for forestry programs. The plan targets to achieve a safe, climate-resilient and prosperous delta with a mission to ensure long term water and food security, economic growth and environmental sustainability, effectively reducing vulnerability to natural disasters and building resilience to climate change. Total 80 projects are planned to be implemented with $37 billion investment, while 34 projects are identified as climate-sensitive.</p>
<h2>National Adaptation Plan</h2>
<p>Bangladesh is currently preparing the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to address climate change. This will include an overview on climate change hazard, risk and vulnerability for Bangladesh. Current adaptation strategies for different impacts due to climate change undertaken in different projects/initiatives from both the government and NGO/CSOs will be identified and Success stories/case studies on resilient adaptation options will be included in the NAP. The plan will include future recommendations on mentioned issues focusing on regional and local level solutions along with strategies at national level. A set of recommendations for institutions and implementation mechanism for NAP will be included.</p>
<h1>Adaptation Action</h1>
<p>As stated earlier, mitigation and adaptation often coexist, and quite a few adaptation actions have mitigation co-benefits. Bangladesh's NDC, therefore, has an adaptation component that describes what Bangladesh has already done on adaptation and what are the priorities for the future long-term vision for adaptation keeping synergies with mitigation actions. Since the development of comprehensive National Adaptation Plan (NAP) is currently underway, Bangladesh wishes to communicate adaptation communication drawing the inputs from NAP process next year. The two vital national plans to address climate change in Bangladesh are the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), developed in 2005 and subsequently revised in 2009, and the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), released in 2009. BCCSAP comprised 44 Programmes under six thematic areas to deal with adverse impacts of climate change as well as supporting low carbon economic growth. The priority pillars for implementing strategies were: (1) Food security, social protection and health; (2) Comprehensive disaster management; (3) Infrastructure development; (4) Research and knowledge management; (5) Mitigation and low carbon development; and (6) Capacity building and institutional development. BCCSAP is in the final stages of being updated to make it more appropriate in keeping with advancements in science, technology and knowledge since its first formulation.</p>
<p>Climate Change Trust Fund Act 2010 (CCTFA) was introduced in response to the need for a specific law for handling Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) of the Government of Bangladesh with transparency so that the benefits accruing from CCTF-financed projects reach the intended beneficiaries.</p>
<p>As a first CVF plan, the draft &ldquo;Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan&rdquo;, aims at mobilizing financing, primarily through international cooperation, for implementing climate resilience initiatives such as an expansion of locally-led adaptation, the establishment of carbon market regime, Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 resilience bonds, climate-resilient and nature-based agricultural and fisheries development, climate resilient well-being programs and accelerated digital revolution, training and skills development.</p>
<p>The NAP formulation will identify the co-benefits so that the synergy between adaptation and mitigation can be fully achieved. As all such activities need to be financed and proper incentives need to be provided, the government has formulated and operationalized a Climate Fiscal Framework (CFF), providing principles and tools for climate fiscal policy-making (CFP).</p>
<p>8th FYP, Bangladesh Country Investment Plan for Environment, Forestry and Climate Change (2016- 2020) (EFCC CIP), Perspective Plan for 2021-2041 (PP2041) emphasizes the importance of managing climate change and indicates the priorities for implementing the BCCSAP. Other sectoral plans and strategies also focus on adaptation action to climate change.</p>
<p>The Forest Investment Plan (FIP, 2017-2022) has been developed to identify future investment opportunities to increase the forest cover, reduce deforestation and forest degradation and improve the livelihoods of the forest-dependent people through the implementation of participatory/social forestry.</p>
<p>The Government of Bangladesh has demonstrated its commitment to undertake both adaptation and mitigation efforts as part of its plan for sustainable development. Every year the Government channels resources for significant investment in projects/programs for ensuring climate resilience. It currently spends US$1 billion a year, around 6 to 7 per cent of its annual budget, on climate change adaptation (CCA). However, the World Bank estimates that the country would need US$5.7 billion as adaptation finance by 2050, which is more than 5 times higher than the current expenditure for CCA.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Three-quarters of money spent on climate change in the country comes directly from the government, while the rest comes from international development partners including bilateral, multi-lateral and private funding. Some significant achievements towards climate change adaptation at the national level are briefly described below:</p>
<h2>Sustainable Ecosystem and Livelihood</h2>
<p>Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD) is currently implementing the Sustainable Forests &amp; Livelihoods Project (SUFAL) supported by World Bank, to improve forest management and increase benefits for forest dependent communities in targeted sites by financing nearly 79,000 hectares of forests on public and private lands, including about 22,000 hectares of coastal green belt across 147 Upazilas (sub-districts). The project emphasizes sustainable livelihood options for the forest dependent communities and engages them in ecosystem management to ensure the sustainability of the forest resources.</p>
<p>Some of the completed projects for sustainable ecosystem management are- Climate Resilient Ecosystem and Livelihoods (CREL), Integrating Community-based Adaptation into Afforestation and Reforestation Programme in Bangladesh and Climate Resilient Participatory Afforestation and Reforestation Project (CRPARP). These projects helped reduce forest degradation and to build the long-term resilience of selected communities to climate change.</p>
<h2>Disaster Management</h2>
<p>The Coastal Embankment Improvement Project (CEIP) has helped Bangladesh mitigate some of the most significant impacts of cyclones and flooding and enhanced emergency response in the coastal region. The project costs US$ 400 million and is supported by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), a targeted fund within the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) framework. Since 2013, the project has increased the protection of 183,900 people including 91,950 women with increased resilience to climate change in selected polders from tidal flooding and storm surges. As of May 2019, the project has protected 21,700 ha of gross area and upgraded 130.58 km embankment. A comprehensive analysis is being undertaken to understand the coastal dynamics better and increase climate resilience in the coastal area.</p>
<p>Other relevant programs that have been implemented over the last decade are National Resilience Programme, Project for Enhancing Capacity on Planning and Implementation of Regional Disaster Risk Reduction, Information Management System for Disaster Risk Management, Enhancing the Capacity of CPP Volunteers and Coastal fisherman to Cope with Climate Change, Construction of Multipurpose Cyclone Shelters in Coastal Areas and Construction of Flood Shelter in Flood Prone Areas across the Country and Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme II.</p>
<h2>Agriculture and Food Security</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock and Ministry of Food have contributed to climate change adaptation through the activities related to, research and education program; agricultural extension and training; production, standardization, certification, preservation and distribution; support and rehabilitation; minor irrigation programs; and improved value chain.</p>
<p>The ministries have initiated many investment projects/programmes which focus mainly on increasing food productivity and sustaining growth in the face of the adverse effect of climate change. Some of the notable projects are- National Agricultural Technology Program-Phase II Project (NATP-2), support to seaweed cultivation, processing and marketing through assessment and capacity development, Enhanced Coastal Fisheries (ECOFISH BD), Community-based Climate Resilient Fisheries and Aquaculture Development in Bangladesh, Inclusive agriculture and agro- industrial value chain development as an enabler of poverty reduction in Bangladesh, South West Region Livestock Development Project, Establishment of Regional Duck Breeding Farm along with Hatchery (3rd Phase), Scavenging Poultry Conservation and Development Project, and Establishment of Fish Landing Centers in Haor Area, Institutionalization of Food Safety in Bangladesh for Safer Food, Construction of new food storage, and Modern Food Storage Facilities.</p>
<h2>Water Resources Management</h2>
<p>Ministry of Water Resources has a major function in addressing the adverse impacts of climate change. Through its recent activities, the Ministry has directly contributed to climate change adaptation. Projects strongly relevant to climate change under this Ministry include Char development and settlement project-4, Flood control and drainage improvement for removal of drainage congestion in Noakhali area, Climate smart agricultural water management, and Planning for flood management in Bangladesh (Ganges and Brahmaputra Basin), Blue Gold Program for Water Management and Environmental Development. Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and water bodies in 64 districts (1st phase) etc. A total 726 km river bank protection, 2,123 km river excavation and dredging, 1,266 km embankment, excavation/ re-excavation of 181 km irrigation canal and 499 km drainage canal, 2.58 million ha land reclamation from rivers and estuary areas in the last 10 years have been done. One million trees have been planted in the embankments, river/ canal banks to mitigate carbon emission and 2725.1 ha marsh lands were rehabilitated and included in fisheries culture to enhance livelihood activities by the Ministry of Livestock and fisheries.</p>
<h2>Surface Water Use and Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
<p>Several city water supply authorities are implementing projects to increase surface water use and reducing ground water use. These projects will reduce energy consumption for pumping groundwater and contribute to GHG emission reduction. Dhaka WASA has implemented three plants supplying 913 million litre per day (MLD) drinking water and 950 MLD capacity will be added from two plants under implementation. Similarly, Rajshahi WASA and Khulna WASA are implementing a 200 MLD capacity plant and 0.78 million cubic metre capacity reservoir.</p>
<h1>Implementation Mechanism</h1>
<h2>Monitoring, Transparency and Institutional Aspects for NDC Implementation</h2>
<p>Adhering to the spirit for global action, and given the various necessary policies and measures undertaken over the last few years and some of them already bearing fruits, the government is enhancing both unconditional and conditional contribution in the updated NDC. These contributions have been prepared considering the national principles of maintaining a minimum 8% rate of economic growth, complete eradication of poverty by 2030, and food and nutrition security for all citizens.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has prepared an NDC implementation roadmap and action plan which suggests Governance arrangements for the NDC-NAP implementation framework. Bangladesh is working to put a workable Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system to maintain transparency and verification of its mitigation efforts and outcomes. The NDC update is based on already planned projects of the government. The unconditional contribution has included confirmed mitigation actions from related ministries and the conditional contribution has included proposed/ planned mitigation actions from related ministries which would require international support.</p>
<h2>Capacity Building and Strengthening</h2>
<p>Bangladesh will need adequate finance, technology, and capacity-building support to implement the NDCs effectually. Capacity building has been identified as a mode of NDC enhancement. Some major areas for capacity building and awareness development include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhancing the capacity of MoEFCC and DoE for effective implementation of NDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consultation with key departments and ministries should be undertaken to understand the challenges they face during NDC implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacities need to be built on regular data collection, archiving and data management for GHG inventory, specialized technical capability, and assumptions to develop of various emissions drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacity building on MRV process and its implementation for different sectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology Development and Transfer</h2>
<p>Bangladesh will require international support in Technology transfer related to GHG emission reduction for different sectors. The achievement of conditional contribution will heavily depend on new and more efficient technologies.</p>
<h2>Implementation Challenges and Barriers</h2>
<p>Some of the key implementation challenges identified during NDC update are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of knowledge and awareness about NDC and mitigation among many relevant sector officials. An extensive awareness campaign on mitigation and NDC will be needed to overcome this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a lack of basic data collection on a regular basis for industries, transport, agriculture, forestry and waste. Studies need to be conducted on a periodic basis to overcome this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the mitigation actions mostly require a large amount of money to successfully implement them, financial support from different agencies, banks, bilateral or multilateral funds will be needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Bangladesh is a small country with a high population, food security is a significant issue. Rice is the primary staple crop of Bangladesh and there is a growing concern among the sector related community regarding emission reduction activities from rice field. The updated NDC incorporated a minimal emission reduction from rice fields. Further research and technology transfer at the field level will be required to enhance emission reduction from the rice field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growing need for land for human settlement, agriculture, industries, and timber and fuelwood is mainly responsible for deforestation and forest degradation. Most forest loss can be attributed to overpopulation, poverty and unemployment, and governance. Governance impacts all forest types and specifically included problems related to uncertainty in land tenure and lack of capacity to implement forestry-related management, policies, and law enforcement. In turn, these indirect drivers lead to a suite of direct drivers of deforestation, namely uncontrolled encroachment from industrialization and agriculture and illegal logging. So, the maintenance of existing forest land is of great concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustainable management of the forest land and restoration of degraded/ deforested land will require substantial financial support. Collaborative management of forest areas with forest-dependent communities can be an effective solution to reduce degradation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Climate Financing</h2>
<p>The implementation of the proposed mitigation and adaptation actions to address climate change requires substantial financial resources. The Government of Bangladesh will continue to commit resources to climate change relevant strategies. The private sector and NGOs can also contribute significantly to these climate change-related activities through public-private partnerships. Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh will continue to play a vital role in financing low-carbon climate-resilient projects and programmes through their separate Green Banking window. However, the full implementation of the strategic mitigation actions is conditional on the support of international stakeholders. The implementation of the prioritized policies and measures assume the continued use of existing and planned national and international financial sources through the use of climate finance and international market mechanisms where appropriate. To have an idea of the financial needs to implement the measures, tentative cost estimation was carried out. These estimates were drawn from existing information from stakeholders and might need to be updated based on further detailed analysis.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is a low-lying delta with a flat topography that makes it particularly susceptible to extreme weather events. The country is relatively small with an area of 147,570 sq. km and located in South Asia. The current population of Bangladesh is 169.81 million in 2020. Among the different zones of the country, the climate change hotspots are in the central and western coastal area, the north-western highlands, and along the main rivers where both biophysical and socio-economic vulnerability are high. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries due to climate change as it faces multiple climate impacts like flood, drought, extreme temperature and rainfall, salinity and sea-level rise. Bangladesh has made substantial progress in the recent past through rapid economic development and poverty reduction measures. The country is also making progress in sustainable development and poverty eradication.</p>

<p>(a) How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances:</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Bangladesh contributes less than 0.35% of global emissions. However, Bangladesh recognizes that in order to meet the 2 degrees objective all countries will need to undertake drastic mitigation measures. Bangladesh's approach is driven by the long-term goal announced by its Prime Minister that its per capita GHG emissions will not exceed the average for developing countries. Therefore, Bangladesh's approach focuses on putting itself on a pathway which will avoid an increase of emissions per capita beyond this level, while pursuing national development goals.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is still putting forward actions that will allow the country to embark on a low carbon development pathway, keeping in mind the global climate change agenda. This NDC update represents an enhanced ambition for mitigation with a substantial increase from the INDC.</p>
<p>The actions needed to deliver on these commitments will require international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity building. Bangladesh will also provide a relevant contribution regarding national financial resources, staff time and robust integration of development and mitigation activities.</p>
<p>In selecting the actions set out above, Bangladesh has prioritized those which fit with the growth priorities set out in our national development plans. In addition, Bangladesh has captured the synergies between mitigation and adaptation. The INDC suggested measures have already been taken forward by the country&rsquo;s own resources, thus demonstrating that Bangladesh is not content to wait for international support to take action on climate change.</p>
