<h1>Update of the NDC of the European Union and its Member States</h1>
<p><strong>SUBMISSION BY GERMANY AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES</strong></p>
<p>Berlin, 17 December 2020</p>
<p><strong>Subject: The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and its Member States</strong></p>
<p>This submission consists of three parts: the Introduction, the updated and enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and the Information provided to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of the NDC.</p>
<h2 id="in-troduction">I. INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p><em>Background on the development of the EU’s enhanced NDC</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in October 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU Member States, the European Council President and the President of the European Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and submitted this to the UNFCCC Secretariat.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In July 2020, the European Council agreed that "the exceptional nature of the economic and social situation due to the COVID-19 crisis requires exceptional measures to support the recovery and resilience of the economies of the Member States. The plan for European recovery will need massive public and private investment at European level to set the Union firmly on the path to a sustainable and resilient recovery, creating jobs and repairing the immediate damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic whilst supporting the Union's green and digital priorities."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same meeting, EU leaders agreed that the EU budget (the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 (MFF)), reinforced by a European Union recovery instrument referred to as the Next Generation EU (NGEU), will be the main European tool for this effort. "Climate action will be mainstreamed in policies and programmes financed under the MFF and NGEU. An overall climate target of 30% will apply to the total amount of expenditure from the MFF and NGEU and be reflected in appropriate targets in sectoral legislation. They shall comply with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the Union's new 2030 climate targets, which will be updated by the end of the year. As a general principle, all EU expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EU leaders agreed further that "EU expenditure should be consistent with [...] the "do no harm" principle of the European Green Deal. An effective methodology for monitoring climate-spending and its performance, including reporting and relevant measures in case of insufficient progress, should ensure that the next MFF as a whole contributes to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Commission shall report annually on climate expenditure.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EU leaders agreed further that “[i]n order to address the social and economic consequences of the objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 and the Union's new 2030 climate target, a Just Transition Mechanism, including a Just Transition Fund, will be created."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this context, on 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new, significantly more ambitious EU climate target for 2030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK, and the Transition Period that will end on 31 December 2020, the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the European Union NDC from that date. Whereas the EU's original NDC submission was applicable also to the United Kingdom, this update is applicable to the EU and its 27 Member States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this submission, the EU updates and enhances its NDC in good time for COP26, and at the same time it prepares for implementing its <em>Next Generation EU</em> plan for sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Ambitious climate action is not just a way to confront the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis, but is also a growth strategy that is a winning strategy, not just for Europe itself but also globally. As the Council of the European Union has highlighted, nature-based solutions play an important role to solve global challenges such as biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation, poverty, hunger, health, water scarcity and drought, gender inequality, disaster risk reduction and climate change.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Information on how the EU has taken action to implement its initial NDC since ratifying the Paris Agreement</em></p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>
<p>Since ratifying the Paris Agreement, the EU has enacted an ambitious, binding, legislative framework to deliver on its initial NDC. The combined effect of the EU policies currently in force under this framework will deliver at least the reductions pledged in the EU’s initial NDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main domestic policies adopted since ratifying the Paris Agreement are summarised in the following paragraphs. Further details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC are provided in the ICTU set out in the annex to this submission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These policies will be reviewed in light of the enhanced NDC set out in Section II, and the ICTU will be revised accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emissions reduction targets under current EU legislation are divided between the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), non-ETS sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and land-use related emissions and removals addressed by the regulation on emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances. While the majority of emission allowances are auctioned, sectors at risk of carbon leakage receive a share of their allowances for free, based on benchmarks that reward the most efficient installations in each sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To deliver on its initial NDC, the EU has reviewed and amended its legislation regarding the EU ETS<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. This will accelerate the annual decreases in the cap from 1.74 % to 2.2 % from 2021 onwards and will also apply in respect of aviation. A new Market Stability Reserve within the ETS is addressing any build-up of surpluses that would undermine the orderly functioning of the EU ETS market, and allowances held in the reserve above a certain level shall, from 2023, no longer be valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the ESR, the EU has agreed legislation that sets individual binding targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions not covered by the EU ETS.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The targets are differentiated in order to address fairness and take into account cost efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emissions from aviation are currently addressed by EU legislation and will be partially addressed by international measures under ICAO. Emissions from aviation are included in the EU ETS; however, currently, the scope of the EU ETS is limited to flights within the European Economic Area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU also adopted a new regulation on greenhouse gas emissions and removals from LULUCF<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> that sets a binding commitment for each Member State to ensure that accounted emissions from land use are at a minimum compensated by an equivalent accounted removal of CO₂ from the atmosphere through action in the sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. The efficiency of the EU’s final and primary energy consumption will be improved by at least 32.5% by 2030 as compared to an historic baseline.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> A new target for increasing renewable energy in final energy consumption has been set to reach at least 32% by 2030<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, which will represent almost a doubling from 2017 levels.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> These targets lead to greater greenhouse gas emissions reductions than previously foreseen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New, binding targets will reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from road transport. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per kilometre from passenger cars sold in the EU must be reduced, on average by 37.5% from 2021 levels by 2030, and new vans on average by 31% from 2021 levels by 2030.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per kilometre from new large lorries must be reduced on average by 30% from 2019/2020 reference period levels. As part of a mandated review in 2022, targets may be revised and/or extended to smaller lorries, buses, coaches and trailers.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progress has been made in further reducing emissions of non- CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases as well. Waste legislation was reviewed, tightening landfilling and recycling targets and increasing the circularity of the EU economy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> EU fossil fuel production and consumption will continue to decrease, resulting in fewer associated fugitive non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In preparation for the implementation of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances, the EU enacted, in 2015, regulations that will reduce emissions from F-gas emissions by 66% by 2030 compared with 2014 levels. This is achieved by limiting the total sales of the most important F-gases, banning the use of F-gases in many new types of equipment, and preventing emissions of F-gases from existing equipment.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>improves the governance of EU climate and energy policy by putting in place a reliable EU-wide reporting and monitoring framework for the period 2021 to 2030. Member States have prepared Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans for the period 2021 to 2030 that include their national contributions to achieve the combined energy and climate targets as well as related commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combined, these policies will deliver by 2030 an at least 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as compared to 1990 levels.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The European Council, on 11 December 2020, invited the Commission to assess how all economic sectors can best contribute to the 2030 target and to make the necessary proposals. As part of the European Green Deal, a new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change will also be presented by the European Commission in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="n-ationally-determined-contribution-n-dc">II. NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) </h2>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li>
<p>The EU and its Member States wish to communicate the following NDC. The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.</p>
<p>This NDC and accompanying information contained in the Annex replaces the 6 March 2015 submission of the EU and its Member States contained in the UNFCCC interim NDC registry and will, as of the date of the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered to be the current NDC maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.</p>

<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>
<p>In 2018, in Katowice, at the conclusion of the first session of the COP serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1), Parties adopted guidance on information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding as applicable to their NDCs, and strongly encouraged Parties to provide this information in relation to their first NDC, including when updating or communicating it by 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Annex to this submission updates the information provided by the EU and its Member States together with its INDC. It describes EU policies that have been agreed since the EU’s ratification of the Paris Agreement and are in force at the time of this submission. This information will be revised in light of the enhanced NDC set out in Section II, and subsequent EU policies adopted to achieve that NDC.</p>

<p>These elements of the EU’s approach have been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1</p>
<p>Accounting for emissions and removals from LULUCF follows specific rules depending on the land accounting category in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/841. Afforested Land and Deforested Land use baseline zero (gross-net accounting). Managed Grassland, Managed Cropland and Managed Wetland use as baseline the average emissions between 2005 and 2009 (net-net accounting). Managed Forest Land uses as baseline a Forest Reference Level based on continuation of Forest Management Practices between 2000 and 2009 and taking into account the age-class structure of forests, projected through the compliance period. The mere presence of carbon stocks is excluded from accounting.</p>
<p><strong>LULUCF Categories:</strong> Emissions and removals occurring on reported categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, and wetland, including land use change between these categories, and between these categories and settlements and other land.</p>
<p><strong>LULUCF Pools</strong>: Above-ground biomass; Below-ground biomass; Litter; Dead wood; Soil organic carbon; Harvested wood products</p>

<p>The EU’s enhanced NDC represents a significant progression beyond both its current undertaking of a 20% emissions reduction commitment by 2020 compared to 1990, and its NDC submitted at the time of ratifying the Paris Agreement. Both the initial NDC and this update require significantly higher emissions reductions than were projected as business as usual at the time of their adoption.</p>

<p>This will ensure the EU continues to be the most greenhouse gas efficient major economy.
<p>By the end of 2019, the EU and its Member States have already reduced their emissions by around 26% on 1990 levels while GDP has grown by more than 64% over the same period.</p>
<p>As a result, average per capita emissions across the EU and its Member States have fallen from 12 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq in 1990 to 8.3 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. This has also made the EU already today the most greenhouse gas efficient major economy<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>
