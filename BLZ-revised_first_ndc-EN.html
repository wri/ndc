      <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>This document contains Belize’s updated national contributions under the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Belize submitted its first Nationally Determined Contribution in 2016 and is now submitting this updated version ahead of the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which is to be held November 2021. This updated version benefits from the availability of more robust data on land use trends and emission factors over the previous version of the NDC submitted in 2016, including the availability of Belize's first Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) sector Greenhouse Gas Inventory showing long-term trends in emissions and removals since 2001. It also carefully considers national capacity and circumstances as well as the availability of technological advancements. It therefore represents an ambitious improvement in the planning and projections of national commitments over the previous NDC, which was largely underpinned by generalized assumptions and deficiencies in data needed for accurate projections in the FOLU sector. As a result, a direct comparison between the first NDC and this updated NDC, in terms of the magnitude of CO2e commitments pertaining to the FOLU sector, cannot be made without considering the increase in accuracy of projections. Belize considers the improvements made in the process to develop more realistic, transparent and achievable NDCs in all sectors as a demonstration of its high ambition goals.</p>
      <p>Climate change is already affecting the livelihoods of Belizeans. Belize, as a small country with relatively minor contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions, has limited capacity to contribute to mitigation of global climate change. However, the country is committed to achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention and supports the even more ambitious target to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels.</p>
      <p>As a member of the High Ambition Coalition, Belize has committed to increasing emissions reduction ambition in this updated NDC, including through the use of nature-based solutions in the FOLU sector intended to increase removals, whilst underpinning the NDC development process with more robust and realistic data and projections in all sectors. Belize is committed to developing a long-term strategy aligned with achieving net zero global emissions by 2050.</p>
      <p>The NDC for Belize is consistent with the overall goal of the Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) which encompasses medium-term economic development, poverty reduction, and longer-term sustainable development. The GSDS is the nation’s primary planning document and outlines four critical success factors for the development of our country and to ensure a better quality of life for all Belizeans, living now and in the future.</p>
      <p>The development of the updated NDC has included broad stakeholder engagement including participation of vulnerable populations in an inception workshop for the NDC update process. Throughout the development of the updated NDC, progress has been validated through engagement with a technical committee of sector leads, including representation of indigenous peoples. Broader engagement of civil society and project owners was facilitated during an engagement phase. The actions and targets included in this updated NDC have undergone a gender and vulnerable group scoring analysis, which produced recommendations for increasing the gender sensitivity of both the medium-term implementation of the NDC and the long-term low emissions development strategy under development.</p>
      <p>The primary GHG emitters are the energy, agriculture, waste, and industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector. The FOLU sector is a net sink of GHG emissions due to GHG removals from forest growth that occurred in the country, which are the main driver of the historical GHG emission profile of Belize.</p>
      <p>As a Small Island Developing State, Belize recognizes that the health and integrity of coastal ecosystems are vital for the health of people and the planet. “Blue carbon”, e.g. basin, fringe and island mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, play many important roles as a nature-based solution to climate change with mitigation, adaptation, and resilience co-benefits. These ecosystems sequester and store significant amounts of carbon, help to ameliorate flooding of low-lying areas on the mainland, safeguard frontline communities and infrastructure from climate impacts and build greater resilience, making their healthy function a triple-win for Belize by contributing to the national carbon sink, offsetting sea level rise and coastal erosion while expanding habitat for biodiverse resources, and supporting a more resilient tourism and aquaculture industry.</p>
      <p>Climate change is already having significant impacts on Belize’s territory, population and key economic sectors. Impacts experienced in the country to date include sustained droughts, floods, increased coastal erosion and changing precipitation patterns. In the future, these effects are expected to increase, thereby threatening the physical and social infrastructure in Belize. Agricultural yields are sensitive to changes in precipitation, temperature and extreme weather. Tourism, which accounts for the most income of any sector is impacted by seal level rise, coral bleaching and impacts on biodiversity. Critical support systems including water resources, health and energy are likewise impacted by the increasingly variable climate in the region. Belize also hosts globally significant ecological resources including rainforest, mangrove forests, wetlands and coral reefs which are under threat from a warming world. Belize considers adaptation as a high priority given its vulnerability to natural hazards and climate-related shocks.</p>
      <p>Targets included in this updated NDC are estimated to avoid a cumulative emissions total across all sectors of 5,647 KtCO2e between 2021 and 2030<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (peaking at1,080 KtCO2e in avoided emissions in the year 2030<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>). As mentioned previously, this revised commitment is not necessarily comparable to the commitment in the first NDC due to improvements in data underlying the projections. Never-the-less, there is a 5% increase in overall commitments in this updated NDC. Key sector targets include: a 63% increase in GHG removals related to the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector and an increase of renewable energy projects for grid connected electricity generation. Targets also include a number of sectoral actions to build resilience and develop capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change in key economic sectors and supporting systems. As part of the High Ambition Coalition, Belize announced its intention to develop a long-term low emissions development strategy, which will include targets for mitigation in key sectors to 2050.</p>
      <p>This updated NDC reflects Belize’s commitment to enhancing its climate ambition. Notably, ambition has been integrated into the updated NDC through the following enhancements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Improvements in the data availability and analysis of projections underpinning commitments, especially in the FOLU sector</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Realistic and achievable commitments</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Increased ambition through expanded sectoral targets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Expanded coverage of gases covered in targets to include N2O and Methane in AFOLU interventions</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Further specification of targets including addition of time frames, quantified emissions reductions and other outcomes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Increased transparency in the development of targets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Detail on the financing, monitoring and implementation of actions included in the NDC.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
          <p>The targets and actions set out in this document demonstrate Belize’s commitment to supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A set of mitigation targets in line with a global goal to keep global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A set of adaptation actions designed to develop resilience of critical systems and populations in Belize</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Consideration of the costs of delivering actions identified and level of climate finance resources to support delivery of these actions.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Government of Belize has also taken a number of steps towards mobilizing finance for climate change activities from domestic and international sources. Recognizing the importance of climate finance aspects, the Climate Finance Working Group has been established under the Belize National Climate Change Committee (BNCCC) to provide guidance to the national efforts to access, manage and effectively use climate finance. The Government of Belize has increased public capital investment in climate change, especially on resilience building aspects.</p>
      <p>The mitigation targets and actions included above are estimated to cost close to USD$ 1.39 billion between 2021 and 2030. Recognizing funding that is already committed, the funding gap to deliver these actions is estimated at USD$ 1.24 billion. Considering recoverable costs in the energy and waste sector, this gap could fall to USD$ 607 million.</p>
      <p>The targets and actions included in the NDC related to adapting to the impacts of climate change are estimated to cost a total of USD$ 318 million between 2021 and 2030. Recognizing funding that is already committed, the funding gap to deliver these actions is estimated at USD$ 146 million.</p>
      <p>The implementation of the targets and actions covered by this NDC will be coordinated by the Belize National Climate Change Office (NCCO), through advice and guidance provided by the Belize National Climate Change Committee (BNCCC). Relevant ministries and stakeholders are represented on the BNCCC. An NDC Implementation Plan will be developed to set out annual targets, funding conditionalities and requirements and responsible parties for activities required to deliver the actions and targets included in the NDC. The NDC Implementation Plan will include specific consideration of how to incorporate stakeholder engagement and delivery of actions to promote a just transition in Belize.</p>
      <p>In coordination with the NDC implementation plan, a series of evaluation systems will be put in place to monitor annual progress against targets and actions for both mitigation and adaptation.</p>
      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <p>This document contains Belize’s updated national contributions under the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Belize submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution in 2016 and is submitting an updated version of these commitments ahead of the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which is to be held November 2021.</p>
      <p>The targets and actions included below reflect relevant policies, strategies and plans in sectors relevant to climate change mitigation and adaptation. They are an extension and application of the focus on climate change in Belize’s key development plans, including the Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy. Links to the Sustainable Development Goals are highlighted for each target and action presented.</p>
      <p>The NDC also summarizes the plans for implementing the actions set out, including activities to finance and monitor progress.</p>
      <h2>3. National context</a></h2>
          <p>3.1 Background</p>
          <p>Climate change is already affecting the livelihoods of Belizeans. Belize, as a small country with relatively minor contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions, has limited capacity to contribute to mitigation of global climate change. However, the country is committed to achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention and supports the even more ambitious target to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. In light of these realities, Belize’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is guided by its commitment to strategically transition to low carbon development while strengthening its resilience to the effects of climate change.</p>
          <p>Belize is an upper middle-income country with a population of 400,000 (2018), 42% (or about 170,000) of whom live in poverty (2009). Belize was ranked 110/189 (2019) on the comprehensive Human Development Index.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
          <p>The national territory covers a land area of approximately 22,967 km2, including 280 km of coastland. The mainland makes up 95% of the territory, and 5% is represented by more than 1,060 small islands or Cayes.</p>
          <p>In 2019, GDP amounted to USD$ 2 billion and has experienced between 2-3% annual growth over recent years. The economy is dominated by the service sector (70% of output), including a significant tourism sector. Agriculture and industry are also significant. Reflecting the importance of tourism to the country’s economy, Covid-19 has had a major impact on growth, with an expected 15% contraction estimated in 2020.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
          <p>Belize has a relatively high debt to GDP ratio of 90%. The unemployment rate is 9.4% (2018). Gender inequality is in line with global averages, and Belize is ranked 89 of 189 countries.</p>
          <p>3.2 Climate change in Belize</p>
              <p>3.2.1 Impacts of climate change</p>
              <p>Global climate change is one of the most serious threats to sustainable development in Belize. Impacts experienced in the country to date include sustained droughts, floods, increased coastal erosion and changing precipitation patterns. Combined, these climate changes and related phenomena are having significant impacts on many environmental, physical, social and economic systems within the country. In the future, these effects are expected to increase, thereby threatening the physical and social infrastructure in Belize.</p>
              <p>According to the recent systematic country diagnostic by the World Bank Group, Belize is one of the most affected countries in the world by weather related events and other natural hazards. As such, Belize incurs annual losses of close to 4% of GDP due to natural disasters (Carneiro, 2016).</p>
              <p>Key vulnerabilities identified include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Hurricanes and tropical storms causing severe losses from wind damage and flooding due to storm surges and heavy rainfall</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Belize City is especially vulnerable to flood damage due to its low-lying land and exposed positions on the coast; low lying topography makes the country’s coastal areas especially vulnerable to sea level rise</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Extreme temperatures affecting crops and livestock</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Home to the second largest barrier reef; its species are especially vulnerable to global warming</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Among small states, Belize ranks 3rd for susceptibility to natural disasters and 5th at risk for climate change<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Ranked 120 (59th most vulnerable) out of 181 countries on vulnerability score<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Projected climate change impacts for Belize include a rise in temperature of between 2°C and 4°C by 2100, a 7-8% decrease in the length of the rainy season, a 6-8% increase in the length of the dry season and a 20% increase in the intensity of rainfall in very short periods. Other expected impacts include increased erosion and contamination of coastal areas, sea level rise, flooding and an increase in the intensity and occurrence of natural hazards such as hurricanes. Many of the effects of climate change are already being felt on the low lying coastal zone and are expected to have significant impacts on many environmental, physical, social and economic systems in Belize.</p>
              <p>In the agriculture sector, Belize expects a projected loss of production within the range of 10% to 20% which could lead to million dollars in lost revenue by the year 2100. The fisheries sector is also under threat from warmer sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events. A decline in this industry can significantly affect Belize’s food security as well as GDP. It would also affect over 3,500 licensed fishers, which could lead to an annual loss of approximately USD$ 12.5 million per year.</p>
              <p>The tourism industry in Belize, which is largely nature based and dependent on natural resources, will primarily be affected by extreme weather events, flooding, inundation, saltwater intrusion and erosion which will occur as a result of rising sea levels. Climate change will threaten the health of Belize’s coral reefs and will affect water supplies and physical property, all of which are critical for the sustainability of the sector. The combined effects of reduced tourism demand, loss of infrastructure, loss of beaches and the loss of the barrier reef can result in the reduced income of approximately USD$ 24 million per year. In 2015, Belize, like much of the Caribbean Basin, saw the introduction of a new economic and ecological challenge with the high rate of influx of sargassum to the region. While studies are still being carried out to understand much more effectively the origins of this influx, climate change is considered an important contributing factor. Similarly, the increase in vector-borne diseases in the region, such as the rise of Chikungunya and Zika virus, creates a significant negative image and impact on the Caribbean and Latin America travel and trade dynamics.</p>
              <p>The country is also affected by tropical storms, tropical waves and hurricanes that move westward through the Caribbean from the months of June to November. Belize considers adaptation as a high priority given its vulnerability to natural hazards and climate-related shocks.</p>
              <p>The impacts of climate change will increase over time and Belizean children of today will face the greatest risks, but have the least influence to affect change.</p>
              <p>3.2.2 Greenhouse gas emissions</p>
              <p>The following table shows the historical GHG emissions used for the updated NDC, which has been estimated based on the national GHG emissions inventory reported in Belize’s 2020 Biennial Update Report.</p>

              <p>Due to significant carbon storage in the Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) sector, the entire country of Belize is a sink of GHG emissions. The main driver of emissions in the FOLU sector is the conversion of forest land to grasslands and croplands, though carbon dioxide removals from forest growth are substantially higher than emissions from land-use change. Reduced emissions from stemming deforestation and forest degradation have been preliminarily identified as significant mitigation opportunities in the sector.</p>
              <p>The primary GHG emitters are the energy, agriculture, waste, and industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector.</p>
              <p>Energy production in Belize comes from sources such as wood (11.7%), petroleum gas (0.7%), hydro (11.4%), biomass (50.1%) and crude oil (26.1%).<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the electricity sector, 37% of electricity is imported from Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Energía. The very significant electricity imports limit the GHG emissions of the sector. Nevertheless, if these imports are replaced by fossil fuel generation, GHG emissions assigned to Belize would increase significantly. An important feedback loop is expected as a result of climate impacts – increased temperatures are expected to increase demand for cooling systems in both commercial and residential settings.</p>
              <p>The transport sub-sector is the largest GHG emitter in the energy sector, representing a significant opportunity to reduce emissions through interventions targeting this sector.</p>
              <p>In the agriculture sector, the primary GHG emissions sources are livestock and forest fires. The mitigation opportunities for livestock are limited, but the control of forest fires was identified as a key opportunity to reduce national GHG emissions.</p>
              <p>In the waste sector, emissions are generated from both the solid waste and wastewater management sector. The improvement of this area will bring significant co-benefits for national health, tourism, and standards of living.</p>
              <p>In the IPPU sector, the size of the industry of the country is limited, and a significant change is not expected in this regard. Nevertheless, consumption emissions such as the emissions coming from the refrigerant and air conditioning will be rising, as Belize expects tourism to increase in the short and medium term.</p>
          <p>National activity on climate change</p>
          <p>The NDC for Belize is consistent with the overall goal of the Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) which encompasses medium-term economic development, poverty reduction, and longer-term sustainable development. The GSDS is the nation’s primary planning document and outlines four critical success factors for the development of our country and to ensure a better quality of life for all Belizeans, living now and in the future.</p>
          <p>In April 2016, Belize ratified the Paris Agreement and submitted its first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to implement the Paris Agreement. Belize’s mitigation potential proposed under its NDC covered multiple sectors such as forestry, electricity, waste and transport conditional on the availability of cost- effective technology, capacity building and adequate financial support. The initial NDC outlined actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from land use and forestry, fuel wood consumption, electricity, transportation and solid waste. Encapsulated in Belize’s original NDC are conditional commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and unconditional commitments to facilitate adaptation nationally.</p>
          <p>As a member of the High Ambition Coalition, Belize has committed to increasing emissions reduction ambition in an updated NDC and developing a long-term strategy aligned with achieving net zero global emissions by 2050.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
              <p>3.3.1 Policy landscape for climate change in Belize</p>
              <p>The Government of Belize is committed to strategically transition to low carbon development while strengthening its resilience to the effects of climate change. Belize has mainstreamed climate change into its national development planning framework, including the long-term development plan (Horizon 2030) and medium-term development plan (Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy). In addition to the existing NDC, the government has developed a National Climate Change Policy, Strategy and Action Plan as well as a climate-resilient investment plan. Many sector-level plans include climate targets.</p>
              <p>The 2016 NDC builds on these plans and focuses on reducing emissions from the forestry, transport, energy, and waste sectors and strengthening the resilience of coastal and marine resources, agriculture, water resources, tourism, fisheries and aquaculture, human health, infrastructure, and forestry.</p>
              <p>The National Climate Change Policy, Strategy and Action Plan sets out the policy direction to strategically transition Belize’s economy to one that is characteristic of low-carbon development while strengthening resilience to the effects of climate change.</p>
              <p>More specifically, relevant policies include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>HORIZON 2030 - the national development framework which was developed after extensive stakeholder consultation inclusive of all political parties. One of its four main pillars is responsible environmental stewardship. The strategies to achieve this pillar, namely integrating environmental sustainability into development planning and promoting sustainable energy for all, address the areas of concern relating to Belize’s emission profile.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>THE NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY FRAMEWORK - aims to provide options that Belize can pursue for energy efficiency, sustainability and resilience over the next 30 years. Additionally, the Sustainable Energy Action Plan is a tool to achieve Belize’s renewable energy and energy efficiency potential while meeting the Government’s economic, social and environmental goals. It provides a framework of actions and tasks to overcome barriers to sustainable energy for the period 2014-2030.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>THE NATIONAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE INVESTMENT PLAN 2013 - provides the framework for an efficient, productive and strategic approach to building economic and social resilience and development. Special importance is given to building climate resilience and reducing disaster risk</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>THE GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY - the guiding development plan for the period 2016–2019. It adopts an integrated, systemic approach and encompasses medium-term economic development, poverty reduction and longer-term sustainable development issues. This planning document also provides detailed guidance on priorities and on specific actions to be taken during the planning period, including actions that contribute to longer term development objectives beyond 2019.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>THE NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY, STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN (NCCPSAP), 2015-2020 - provides policy guidance for the development of an appropriate administrative and legislative framework, in harmony with other sectoral policies, for the pursuance of a low-carbon development path for Belize. In addition, the NCCPSAP also seeks to encourage the development of the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution and to communicate it to the UNFCCC.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>ROADMAP FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY - creates a platform for low carbon growth in new areas while still attaining the national development targets. The roadmap compliments the NCCPSAP and GSDS by focusing on building technical capacity, strengthening institutions and policies, facilitating public-private partnerships and engaging stakeholders to adopt sustainable practices which should lead to national resilience to the impacts of climate change.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>THE NATIONAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICY (NSWMP) - the main public policy instrument regarding the management of solid waste (e.g., municipal, industrial and hazardous types of waste, among others) for Belize. Its overall goal is to ensure that “The system for managing solid wastes in Belize is financially and environmentally sustainable, and contributes to improved quality of life," while also contributing to the promotion of sustainable development by preventing, re-using, recycling or recovering waste wherever feasible and beneficial. The measures outlined in the NSWMP will be implemented in accordance with the National Solid Waste Management Strategy and Implementation Plan which have also been prepared.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In addition to these policies and strategy documents, national climate adaptation plans have been developed for the agriculture and water sectors.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>3.3.2 Activities related to climate change since the 2016 NDC submission</p>
              <p>Blue carbon</p>
              <p>As a Small Island Developing State, Belize recognizes that the health and integrity of coastal ecosystems are vital for the health of people and the planet. “Blue carbon”, e.g. mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, play many important roles as a nature-based solution to climate change with mitigation, adaptation, and resilience co- benefits. These ecosystems sequester and store significant amounts of carbon, safeguard frontline communities and infrastructure from climate impacts and build greater resilience, making their healthy function a triple-win for Belize by providing a carbon sink, offsetting sea level rise and coastal erosion while expanding habitat for biodiverse resources, and supporting a more resilient tourism and aquaculture industry. They are also among the most biodiverse environments on the planet and provide essential habitats for fisheries, in addition to other ecosystem services such as wave attenuation, sediment stabilization, and water filtration. Together with coral reefs, they sustain the foundation of the marine tourism economy in Belize. Protection of these vital ecosystems protects the climate, people and nature.</p>
              <p>Since the 2016 NDC, Belize has established stronger frameworks to conserve these valuable coastal habitats. The Government of Belize endorsed the first Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Plan in 2016, which incorporates ecosystem services and integrated risk analysis into decision-making. Further, <i>The Forests (Protection of Mangroves) Regulations of 2018</i> established a permitting system that aims to safeguard mangroves and their many ecosystem services from deforestation and degradation. Other instruments such as the draft National Land Use policy (2019) speak to the need for securing the protection, rehabilitation and restoration of critical water catchment areas and forests as part of national efforts to reverse and minimize the impact of land degradation. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2016) aims to ensure that Belize's natural environment is valued, enhanced in resilience and contributes to an improved quality of life through securing protection and restoration of natural ecosystems, including within the coastal zone.</p>
              <p>In 2020, the NCCO, in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund and partners, convened the first Blue Carbon Working Group for Belize. The Working Group includes representatives from across government agencies, academia, civil society, communities, and other key stakeholders, and was formed to value the blue carbon potential and adaptation co-benefits of Belize’s coastal ecosystems, in order to inform targets and recommendations to strengthen their protection and effective management over the long-term. Targets and recommendations derived from the Working Group will be integrated within the policies and plans referenced above, including planned updates to the ICZM Plan, the NBSAP, the National Climate Change Policy Strategy and Action Plan, and the Forests (Protection of Mangroves) Regulations.</p>
              <p>Mobilizing climate finance</p>
              <p>Government of Belize has also taken a number of steps towards mobilizing finance for climate change activities from domestic and international sources. Recognizing the importance of climate finance aspects, the Climate Finance Working Group has been established under the National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC) to provide guidance to the national efforts to access, manage and effectively use climate finance. The Government of Belize has increased public capital investment in climate change, especially on resilience building aspects. In 2018-19 the government invested USD $8.9 million in domestic public finance for resilience building projects.</p>
              <p>Belize has accessed climate finance from all climate funds under the UNFCCC finance mechanism including the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Adaptation Fund (AF), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Belize Protected Areas Conservation Trust (PACT) is the National Implementing Entity (NIE) for the Adaptation Fund and the first national accredited entity for GCF which has increased the national capacity to access climate finance.</p>
              <p>Apart from the UNFCCC, climate finance sources have been accessed by Belize from other bilateral and multilateral agencies. Since 2010 about 30 climate change projects have been implemented in Belize with value of over USD$ 135 million (both grants and loans), in addition to another 10 regional climate change projects of over USD$ 100 million (grants and loans). The Economic Development Council (EDC) of Belize has been established to promote Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs) which has mobilized over USD$ 200 million investments for energy sector.</p>
              <p>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (+)</p>
              <p>The Government of Belize has pursued the development of its REDD+ strategy, National Forest Monitoring System, Forest Reference Level (2015-2020), and Safeguards Information System in order to pursue results- based payments under the UN REDD+ platform. The current situation is that the REDD+ Strategy is being finalized in 2021, the National Forest Monitoring System is constantly being improved, the Forest Reference Level (2015-2020) has already been technically assessed in 2020 by UNFCCC and the Safeguards Information System is currently being finalized in 2021. Beyond, and in addition to, the FOLU targets listed in this NDC, Belize intends to pursue results-based payments for the present FRL, as well as for a new FRL to be developed for 2021 to 2025.</p>

          <p>Technical assistance under the CAEP has included an assessment of policy targets, mapping of activities related to climate change, stakeholder engagement, modelling of GHG impacts in different sectors, an analysis of technology options to achieve NDC targets and the development of financing and implementation strategies.</p>
          <p>Technical assistance provided by CfRN to the FOLU roundtable included the projections of without and with project emission scenarios for the committed activities in the land-use, land-use change and forestry sub- sector using data and emission factors from the country's GHG inventory database for the FOLU sector. CfRN also assisted by providing expert advice on ensuring harmonization among the NDC, GHG Inventory, and REDD+ Strategy.</p>
          <p>4.2 Inclusive development of updated NDC</p>
          <p>The development of the updated NDC has included broad stakeholder engagement including participation of vulnerable populations in an inception workshop for the NDC update process.</p>
          <p>Throughout the development of the updated NDC, progress has been validated through engagement with a technical committee of sector leads, including representation of indigenous peoples. Broader engagement of civil society and project owners was facilitated during an engagement phase. The actions and targets included in this updated NDC have undergone a gender and vulnerable group scoring analysis, which produced recommendations for increasing the gender sensitivity of both the medium-term implementation of the NDC and the long term low emissions development strategy under development.</p>
      <h2>5. Summary of Belize’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution</h2>
      <p>Belize is pleased to submit this updated Nationally Determined Contribution which includes both a mitigation and an adaptation component.</p>
      <p>Targets included in this updated NDC are estimated to avoid a cumulative emissions total of 5,647 KtCO2e between 2021 and 2030<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> (peaking at 1,080 KtCO2e in avoided emissions in 2030).<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Key sector targets include: a 63% increase in GHG removals related to the AFOLU sector and an increase of renewable energy projects in the grid connected. Targets also include a number of sectoral actions to build resilience and develop capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change in key economic sectors and supporting systems.</p>
      <p>This updated NDC reflects Belize’s commitment to enhancing its climate ambition. Notably, ambition has been</p>
      <p>integrated into the updated NDC through the following enhancements:</p>
      <ul>

          <p>Detail on the financing, monitoring and implementation of actions included in the NDC.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
          <p>As part of the High Ambition Coalition, Belize announced its intention to develop a long-term low emissions development strategy, which will include targets for mitigation in key sectors to 2050.</p>
          <p>The targets and actions set out in this document demonstrate Belize’s commitment to supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A set of mitigation targets in line with a global goal to keep global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A set of adaptation actions designed to develop resilience of critical systems and populations in Belize.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Consideration of the costs of delivering actions identified and level of climate finance resources to support delivery of these actions.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>6. Mitigation targets and actions</h2>
          <p>6.1 Context</p>
          <p>Belize is committed towards achieving the central aim of the Paris Agreement by pursuing efforts to limit the global temperature increase even to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This commitment led to the development and submission of Belize’s first NDC on April 20th, 2016 and the updated NDC set out below.</p>
          <p>In parallel to the NDC update, which updates previous medium-term mitigation and adaptation targets to 2030, Belize is developing a Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) to set out the country’s long term mitigation ambitions to 2050. This process, supported by the UNDP, will aim to define a long-term target for low carbon and carbon neutral development.</p>
          <p>6.2 ectoral targets and actions</p>
          <p>The NDC includes specific targets set out at the sector level. Where targets relate to mitigation of greenhouse gases, the target sets out a quantified emissions reduction and a series of actions are provided for delivery of the target.</p>

              <p>Belize is considering management of its near-shore coastal ecosystems (fringe and island mangroves and seagrass) in an integrated and holistic way. Fringe and island mangroves account for around 30% of total mangrove cover, while the other 70% of mangroves are located on the mainland in basin and littoral formations. All mangrove formations are integrated into the Forest Reference Level within the national definition of forests. The understanding of the climate influence of Belize’s mangrove ecosystems, including both above- and below-ground carbon, is more advanced; they are estimated to currently hold total ecosystem carbon stocks of approximately 92,962,893 (92,963 Kt) tCO2e, and annually sequester around 431,644 (432 Kt) tCO2e/year.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> These figures will be further validated based on field research to be completed in 2021.</p>
              <p>Belize intends to maintain and enhance these carbon storage functions of these natural carbon sinks, as well as the adaptation and resilience values they provide, by protecting and restoring mangrove and seagrass habitats through the target and actions outlined below.</p>

              <p>6.2.3 Energy</p>
              <p>The energy sector, among other sectors, presents numerous opportunities to reduce GHG emissions on the global scale and here in Belize. The Belize INDC presented in 2015 established very ambitious goals for the electricity generation subsector with a target of reducing GHG emissions by 2.4 million metric tons of CO2e during the 2014-2033 period via renewable energy and energy efficiency measures (potential established by the Belize Sustainable Energy Strategy and Action Plan).</p>
              <p>The analysis of Belize’s Sustainable Energy Strategy and Action Plan was conducted on the basis of unrealized sustainable energy potential (proposed national sustainable energy strategy scenario) rather than projecting the introduction of renewable energy generation within the interconnected energy matrix, taking into consideration contributions from the Mexican generation network and private sector investment in renewable energy source projects.</p>
              <p>In this updated NDC, Belize maintains its strong ambition to increase the implementation of renewable energy projects within the interconnected energy matrix and to gradually reduce the amount of electricity generation being imported from Mexico. Similarly, the national utility, Belize Electricity Limited (BEL), is developing an electricity expansion plan (up to 2030) with the intention to project a pathway of how Belize wants to develop this sector within the next 10 years. Notably, the electricity expansion plan will assist decision-makers with information and allow for greater precision in the analysis of renewable energy generation being added to Belize’s interconnected energy matrix. The analytical exercise should be done from the perspective of carbon intensity of electricity generation which takes into account the operating margin emission factor for Belize’s national electricity grid. This approach will allow for a better estimate of CO2e emissions and will, therefore, assist in establishing with greater precision the impact of renewable energy projects towards the displacement of fossil fuel-based generating sources and/or at the same time the displacement of electricity imports from Mexico.</p>
              <p>Subsequent to the implementation of climatic actions in the energy sector, Belize estimates realization of avoided emissions from the power sector equivalent to 19 KtCO2e per year through system and consumption efficiency measures amounting to at least 100 GWh/year by 2030. In addition, projection is made to avoid 44 KtCO2e in the national electricity supply by 2030 through the introduction of expanded capacity from renewable energy sources.</p>
              <p>The potential for estimate refinements will depend on carbon intensity analysis of the grid connected generation to determine its Operating Margin Emission Factor. Applying this analytical tool will enable a more accurate estimation of the GHG emissions generated by the energy sub-sector against an established baseline year. Notably, Belize's contribution is conditionally supported by sources of investment and the country reserves the right to make changes to the projections and estimates based on the availability and integration of new information.</p>
              <p>Belize is committed to contributing to global climate action and low-carbon development. Thus, Belize presents its energy sector climatic targets and actions below.</p>

              <p>The mitigation targets and actions included above are estimated to cost close to USD$ 1.39 billion between 2021 and 2030. Recognizing funding that is already committed, the funding gap to deliver these actions is estimated at USD$ 1.24 billion. Considering recoverable costs in the renewable energy and waste sector, this gap could fall to USD$ 607 million.</p>
      <h2>7. Adaptation targets and actions</h2>
          <p>7.1 Context</p>
          <p>“The adverse effects of Climate Variability and Climate Change, particularly on crop production and food security, natural ecosystems, marine and coastal areas, water resources and human health, as well as on housing and infrastructure are particularly obvious around us. These impacts pose major impediments to efforts being implemented by the Government of Belize to promote sustainable economic and social development and poverty reduction, which are the first and overriding priorities of the national government. Ocean acidification due to rising carbon dioxide levels will create serious risks to marine ecosystems and species, including our coral reef systems.”- (2015-2020) National Climate Change Policy, Strategy and Action Plan</p>
          <p>Climate change is already having significant impacts on Belize’s territory, population and key economic sectors. Agricultural yields are sensitive to changes in precipitation, temperature and extreme weather. Tourism, which accounts for the most income of any sector is impacted by seal level rise, coral bleaching and impacts on biodiversity. Critical support systems including water resources, health and energy are likewise impacted by the increasingly variable climate in the region. Belize also hosts globally significant ecological resources including rainforest, mangrove forests, wetlands and coral reefs which are under threat from a warming world.</p>
          <p>7.2 Sectoral targets</p>
          <p>The NDC includes specific targets set out at the sector level for adaptation and resilience to climate change including additional coverage from the previous NDC for land use, human settlements and infrastructure sector as well as the human health sector. Where targets relate to broad areas of increased resilience, a series of actions are provided for delivery of the target.</p>
              <p>7.2.1 Coastal zone and marine resources</p>
              <p>In addition to important mitigation benefits, Belize recognizes the many co-benefits coastal wetlands and coral reefs offer for adaptation to climate impacts and building resilience for coastal communities. The coastal zone is fundamental to the lives and livelihoods of many Belizeans.</p>
              <p>Significant tracts of Belize’s coastline have an elevation of one meter or less, a source of significant vulnerability with sea-level rise. Protection and restoration of mangrove and seagrass ecosystems not only provides emissions reductions benefits, but also will ensure Belize is better placed to protect vulnerable communities and their livelihoods, safeguard its rich biodiversity, and develop sustainably.</p>

      <h2>8. Implementation measures</h2>
          <p>8.1 Institutional arrangement</p>
          <p>The implementation of the targets and actions covered by this NDC will be coordinated by the Belize National Climate Change Office (NCCO), through advice and guidance provided by the Belize National Climate Change Committee (BNCCC). Relevant ministries and stakeholders are represented on the BNCCC.</p>
          <p>In terms of proposals and coordination of financial resources, the NCCO will coordinate financing activities, with advice from the BNCCC Climate Finance Working Group. Recognising the importance of climate finance aspects, the Climate Finance Working Group has been established under the BNCCC to provide guidance to the national efforts to access, manage and effectively use climate finance.</p>
          <p>Belize Protected Areas Conservation Trust (PACT) is the National Implementing Entity (NIE) for the Adaptation Fund and the first national accredited entity for GCF which has increased the national capacity to access climate finance.</p>
          <p>The Economic Development Council (EDC) of Belize has been established is promoting Public-Private- Partnerships (PPPs) which has mobilized over USD$ 200 million in energy sector investment.</p>
              <p>8.1.1 Implementing the NDC</p>
              <p>An NDC Implementation Plan will be developed to set out annual targets, funding requirements and responsible parties for activities required to deliver the actions and targets included in the NDC. The implementation plan will be prepared through the CAEP process and include specific activity-level measures from 2021-2025.</p>
          <p>8.2 Tracking progress against NDC targets</p>
              <p>8.2.1 NDC Monitoring System</p>
              <p>The Initiative for Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) is currently developing an MRV system to track the impacts and progress of climate change action, which includes the NDC. This system will coordinate measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) metrics for mitigation actions and targets as well as monitoring and evaluation (M & E) of adaptation actions. The National Climate Change Office will be responsible for monitoring and reporting annual progress against NDC targets and actions.</p>
              <p>8.2.2 Energy sector MRV tool</p>
              <p>IRENA is working with the Belizean government to create an energy database to track progress for the NDC targets in the energy sector and mitigation actions. This tool will provide a simple tracking mechanism for the government to use and maintain as part of the larger national MRV system.</p>
          <p>8.3 Financing NDC</p>
          <p>As a member of the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) group,<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Belize is exceptionally vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change. Its topography as low-lying coastal nation and geographical location makes the country exposed to the risk of rising sea levels and increasing frequency of tropical storms. This makes Belize a priority to receive financing support for realizing its climate actions across different sectors in their NDC.</p>
          <p>The costs of the actions included above are estimated at USD$ 1.71 billion, including between USD$ 607 million and 1.38 billion in required resources. In addition to these delivery costs, an additional USD$ 6.6 million is expected in feasibility costs,<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> which reflects the broader capacity requirements to facilitate delivery of these actions. Some of this feasibility cost may be delivered through in-kind contributions, including staff time across the Belizean government.</p>
          <p>The estimated total cost of conducting feasibility studies for the prioritized actions is USD$6,664,556. The estimated total cost for Mitigation Priority Actions is USD$3,650,163, while the estimated total cost of feasibility studies for Adaptation Priority Actions is USD$3,014,393. The estimated average cost of a feasibility study per project is USD$154,990.</p>

          <p>Details of the conditionality of targets and actions proposed here are provided in sections 4 and 5.</p>
          <p>A climate finance strategy will be developed and implemented for 2021 – 2025 through which the NDCs will be financed. It is obvious that continued support from the international community is vital in the climate finance strategy along with attracting private investments for the sectors such as renewable energy<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>. The strategy will undergo a mid-term review. The proposed strategy will be developed under the following guiding principles:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Meeting the national climate change priorities specified in NDCs: Meeting the national priorities in climate change is one of the important aspects in climate finance strategy. The national climate change priorities are represented through the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>An ambitious and a futuristic vision for climate investments: The NDC targets are set in every five years as a rolling process. With the incremental impacts of climate change, the evolution of best available science, technology improvements and time lag in climate investments, the climate finance strategy must also consider a broader horizon. While recognizing the NDCs as the short-term priorities, the climate investment plans must have a longer horizon with an ambitious and futuristic vision. It is, therefore, recommended to consider the potential of transformational change with a futuristic vision and higher level of ambition in the climate finance strategy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>National and International policy coherence: Belize has several national level developmental policies pertaining to different sectors including the private sector and civil society organizations. On the other hand, as a party to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, Belize has committed to some international policies pertaining to climate change and sustainable development. The Climate Finance Strategy is developed in coherence with those national and international policies and commitments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Maximizing synergies and co-benefits of sustainable development: Climate change challenges affect the achievement of sustainable development. Therefore, climate finance must contribute to the sustainable development process. Hence it is vital to ensure that climate investments are maximizing the synergies with the overall sustainable development process and generating sustainable development co-benefits. The climate finance strategy is, therefore, oriented towards maximizing synergies and co-benefits of sustainable development as well as supporting green economic recovery and growth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Enhancing national capacities: Enhancing local capacities are imperative to ensure Belize is prepared to address the current and projected climate change challenges. Capacities are inclusive of institutional arrangements, systems, processes, human resources, etc. must be enhanced to sustain the local efforts to meet the requirements to access and utilize climate finance. Therefore, the climate finance strategy must address the local capacity building aspects, including commitments concerning local and indigenous communities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Promoting regional and multilateral collaborations: Regional and multilateral collaborations can set a strong foundation for national efforts to face climate change challenges. Belize being a small country in the Caribbean region, such collaborations are always helpful to achieve higher results. The climate finance strategy will also facilitate such collaborations while recognizing the national climate change priorities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The integrated and inclusive approach in climate finance: Climate change challenges cannot be tackled through linear processes and by a single organization. It requires to coordinate among multiple organizations and partners from while integrating multiple processes. Engagement of government entities, private sector entities, and civil society organizations, an appropriate representation of all the relevant sectors and tiers e levels must be promoted through the climate finance strategy. Therefore, an integrated approach must be adopted where sectors, actors and tires are linked vertically and horizontally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Respecting the global sustainable development principle of “no-one left behind”, the climate finance must ensure the inclusion of all groups in the process. Aspects such as gender, indigenous communities, people with disabilities, youth must be represented in a balanced way in the climate finance strategy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A systematic process of tracking and monitoring of Climate Finance Flows: Scale, effectiveness, adequacy, and accessibility are an important factor in climate finance. Therefore, establishing and maintaining an appropriate system to track and monitor climate finance should be an integral part of the climate finance strategy to effectively support and get the overall governance of climate flows in Belize right. A robust national MRV process and system will foster transparency and integrity thereby promoting donor and investor confidence.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The climate finance strategy will adopt an integrated approach with appropriate vertical (tiers) and horizontal (sectoral) levels of integration. It will cover the key elements including the national priorities, finance sources and instruments, country capacity building, integration and tracking of climate finance. The strategy expects to build on the current positive aspects in climate action and enhance the ambition of climate action with both domestic and international finance sources along with private sector participation. It is expected to enhance the inclusion aspects of climate action by integrating those aspects into the finance strategy.</p>
          <p>To support the implementation targets and activities set out later, Belize will explore the potential for new and additional financing opportunities to support mangrove protection and restoration, such as multilateral and bilateral financing, and blended financing schemes such as: private sector investments in green infrastructure, tourism, insurance, and other sectors; philanthropy; impact investing; ‘blue carbon’ credits; green/blue bonds; catastrophe bonds; among others.</p>
          <p>8.4 Developing capacity and technology for delivery of NDC</p>
          <p>In relation to the targets and actions included in the NDC, several activities have been identified from policy documents and stakeholder engagement for developing capacity amongst responsible parties to implement the NDC. These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Facilitate greater public-private initiatives to implement cost-effective measures to address crop development, livestock production, and improving soil quality in the interest of building resilience to climate change</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Strengthen agricultural research and development and improve on the data collection capacity and analysis capabilities of the sector</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Enhance the epidemiology capacity of the health sector to address efficiently epidemics/ outbreaks. Undertake water policy reform including pricing and irrigation policies</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Support capacity-building, including institutional capacity, for preventive measures, planning, preparedness and management of disasters relating to climate change, including contingency planning, especially for droughts and floods in areas prone to extreme weather events</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>8.5 Promoting a just transition</p>
          <p>The NDC implementation plan will include specific consideration of how to incorporate stakeholder engagement and delivery of actions to promote a just transition in Belize including understanding inter- generational impacts of climate change are understood and the current and future needs of children and young people are adequately considered. In part, the adaptation actions identified reflect an application of the principles of just transition on a global scale. The long-term climate strategy under development by the NCCO with the support of UNDP will include specific gender analysis to incorporate the needs of vulnerable populations in the long term strategy.</p>

  <li id="fn20">As part of the Central American regional study project, IRENA is developing a Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) study for Belize, complemented with a power system flexibility study with IRENA’s FlexTool. The study will investigate the technology options that enable an energy transition at country level through the accelerated development of renewable energy in the energy mix. In the framework of this study, IRENA together with the government of Belize is developing a reference case and decarbonization perspectives for the power generation and consumption sectors i.e. buildings, transport and industry of Belize. IRENA, upon validation from country representatives, will provide a slide deck with the analysis results for the above-mentioned scenarios, from which the scenarios might be particularly interesting for the NDC review process as renewable energy options, sustainable fuels and energy efficiency measures are further explored. The results of the REmap-FlexTool analysis can serve Belize as a reference for establishing energy sector mitigation targets in the NDC review process of the country.<a href="#fnref20">↩</a></li>
