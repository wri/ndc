## Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 

### Communicated to the UNFCCC on September 28, 2015 

### The National Context


As a small island developing state (SIDS) that is  extremely vulnerable to the adverse impacts  of  climate change  and  cognizant  of  the  implications  for  its  economic,  social  and environmental  sectors,  the  Government  of  Barbados  (GOB)  ratified  the  United  Nations Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  in  1994  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in   2000. Since then, Barbados has actively participated in the Conference of Parties (COP) and  related inter-sessional meetings of the UNFCCC, as well as undertaken a variety of measures  that  fit  with  the  overarching  objective  of  the  Convention  and  intended  to  build  national  resilience to the challenges imposed by climate change. Accordingly, with the recognition of  the need for an urgent global response to address the adverse impacts of climate change,  the GOB is expecting the agreed and adopted outcome of the 21st COP of the UNFCCC to be  an internationally legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is in the form of a  protocol and is applicable to all Parties.  

Barbados  possesses  many  of  the inherent  economic,  social  and  environmental vulnerabilities that are associated with Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Among others, these  include  susceptibility  to  natural  disasters  and  extreme  events;  a  small  population; limited  land  and  natural  resource  base;  and  a  small  open  economy.  These  will  be exacerbated  by  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and,  if  left  unchecked,  undermine  the  sustainable  development  gains  that  have  been  achieved  over  the  course  of  the  country's  history.  

Barbados is experiencing more extreme weather events, as well as more subtle changes to temperature and precipitation patterns. Observations confirm that temperatures are rising,  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events  are  increasing,  sea  levels  are  rising  and  coral  bleaching events are more frequent. These observations are consistent with climate change  projections for the Caribbean region [^1] 

[^1]:Climate Change Risk Profile for Barbados (CARIBSAVE 2012) 

The GOB has drafted a National Climate Change Policy Framework (NCCPF), which provides the  country's  overarching  approach  to  adaptation  and  mitigation  and  is  in  line  with  the  Barbados Sustainable Development Policy (2004). The  NCCPF is monitored by the National  Climate Change Committee (NCCC). 

                                                          
 
The Barbados Sustainable Development Policy's overarching goal is stated as "to  ensure  the  optimisation  of  the  quality  of  life  for  every  person  by  ensuring  that economic growth and development does not occur to the detriment of our ecological capital."  

Deriving  from  this,  the  primary  goal  of  the  NCCPF  is  to  "establish  a  national  process  for adapting to climate change effects and minimising greenhouse gas emissions over the short, medium and long term, and to do this in a manner that is coordinated and consistent with  the broader sustainable development aspiration." Its associated objectives are to: 
- establish  an  appropriate  mechanism  for  responding  to  the  challenges  of  climate change; 
- engage  in  regional  and  international  climate  change  negotiation,  planning  and 
response mechanisms; 
- effect  full  stakeholder  engagement  in  the  development  and  execution  of  domestic 
climate change mitigation and adaptation actions; and 
- conduct climate change research. 

The  NCCPF  is  monitored  by  a  National  Climate  Change  Committee  that  is  comprised  of representatives  of  government ministries,  non-governmental  organizations,  and  private sector agencies. 

Despite its limited financial resources and negligible contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  on  a  global  scale,  Barbados  is  taking  a  proactive  and  ambitious  approach  to reducing  its  own emissions  by introducing  concrete  mitigation  actions  that  will  see  the  decarbonisation  of  its  electricity  grid,  initiatives  to  improve  energy  efficiency  and  reduced emissions  from  its  other  sectors.  The  country's  Green  Economy  Scoping  Study [^2],  national Sustainable  Energy  Framework  (SEF) [^3]  and  proposed  Nationally  Appropriate  Mitigation  Action  (NAMA) [^4]  for  the  energy  sector,  form  the  backbone  of  this  Intended  Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). Inevitably, as a SIDS, while Barbados can show  leadership  and  intention,  a  portion  of  its  ambitious  contribution  to  reduce GHG  emissions  will  be  dependent on technology transfer and financial support from the international community  in order to realise its objectives. 

### Adaptation 

As a minimal contributor to global GHG emissions, Barbados places prominence on adapting  to the effects of climate change. The changing conditions will see a noticeable impact on the  limited availability of fresh water, agricultural productivity, increased land degradation and  reduced fish stocks caused by the migration of fish to cooler waters beyond the Caribbean  region.  The  combination  of  reducing precipitation  and  salt  water  intrusion  from  sea  level rise will compound the issue of insufficient water availability (through salinization of ground water  aquifers),  further  affecting  the  productivity  of  both  agriculture  and  fisheries. Barbados will face indirect climate-related impacts including drought, flooding, and storms  (physical damage), increased pest outbreaks, the spread of invasive species, the increased  probability for the occurrence of vector borne and heat related illnesses and the destruction  of key ecosystems which all threaten national productivity and may undermine the potential  for  real  growth.  With  the  majority  of  Barbados'  population  and  its  economic  activities  located  within  its  narrow  coastal  zone,  this  area  is  undeniably  one  of  the  island's  most  valuable economic and social assets. Sea level rise, storm surges and inundation, in addition  to the  increased frequency  in tropical  storms, will  present direct  challenges to the  coastal  zone,  in  particular  to  the  tourism  sector  in  terms  of  potential  loss  and  damage  to  key  infrastructure.

[^4]: NAMA for renewable energy and energy efficiency in Barbados. The NAMA is currently in draft form and is expected to be published shortly.  

 
Barbados'  national  adaptation  response  is  consistent  with  existing  national  level  policy,  in  particular  the  Medium  Term  Growth  &  Development  Strategy  -  2013  -  2020 [^5]  and  the  Barbados  Sustainable  Development  Policy.  Adaptation  planning  is  also  aligned  to  the CARICOM Regional Framework for Achieving Development Resilient to Climate Change and  its associated Implementation Plan 2011 - 2021. 

Taking  a  mainstreaming  approach  to  climate  change,  the  GOB  has  started  to  incorporate climate change adaptation into the following national plans and strategies: 

-  Medium Term Growth and Development Strategy 2013 - 2020;  
-  Physical Development Plan; 
-  White Paper  on  the  Development of Tourism  in Barbados  and National Adaptation 

Strategy to Address Climate Change in the Tourism Sector in Barbados; 

-  Coastal Zone Management Plan; 
-  Storm Water Management Plan; 
-  Other sectoral plans including for agriculture, fisheries, water and health. 


The  sectors  identified  as  most  vulnerable  to  climate  change  are  agriculture,  fisheries,  tourism, water, human health, coastal resources and human settlements [^6]. Climate change  will impact  vulnerable  groups  disproportionately, including  youth and  gender  in  Barbados'  national  development  perspectives,  which  are  cross-cutting  concerns  planning [^7].

### Mitigation 

#### Economy-wide Contribution 

> Barbados  intends  to  achieve  an  economy-wide  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  of  44% compared  to  its  business  as  usual  (BAU)  scenario  by  2030.  In  absolute  terms,  this translates to a reduction of 23% compared with the baseline year, 2008. As an interim target, the intention will be to achieve an economy-wide reduction of 37% compared  to  its  business  as  usual  (BAU)  scenario  by  2025,  equivalent  to  an  absolute reduction of 21% compared to 2008.

The above emission reduction contributions will be achieved through the mitigation actions 
in  the  energy  and  waste  sectors,  which  accounted  for  the  vast  majority  (88%)[^8]  of  GHG 
emissions in Barbados in 2008.

#### Energy Sector 


Energy  consumption  accounted  for  72%  of  Barbados'  GHG  emissions  in  2008 [^8]  and  is  therefore  the  focus  of  its  mitigation  activity.  Within  the  sector  67%  arises  from  energy  generation  and  33%  from  transport.  The  following  sub-sector  contributions  have  been  identified: 

                                                           
[^8]: Barbados 2010 Greenhouse Gas Inventory. This forms part of the Second National Communication Report, 
which will be submitted to the UNFCCC shortly. 2008 has been chosen as the base year, so that measures in 
the waste sector that were implemented in 2009 can be excluded from the BAU projection.

workshop meeting in September 2015.
[^10]: BAU projections take into account the expected growth in the future in each sector taking into account
current mitigation activities. As identified in footnote (8), 2008 has been chosen as the base year.
[^11]: This reflects the preference of the CARICOM Heads of Government for “five (5) year mitigation commitment cycles, with robust ex ante and ex post review and upward adjustment processes” as defined in the 2015 Declaration on Climate Change developed at the 36th Regular Meeting of the Conference of the Heads of
Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), 2-4 July 2015, Bridgetown Barbados.

i. Renewable energy:  contributing 65% of total peak electrical demand by 2030 [^9]. The country  has  made  huge  strides  in  this  regard;  for  example  distributed  solar photovoltaic (PV) installation is growing exponentially and this trend is expected to continue. Other planned measures include waste-to-energy and biomass generation plants, wind, distributed and centralized solar PV and capture and use of landfill gas for energy generation.  

ii. Electrical energy efficiency: a 22% reduction in electricity consumption compared to  a BAU [^10] scenario in 2029. Planned measures in this sector include the ‘Public Sector  Energy  Efficiency  and  Conservation  Programme',  implementation  of  applicable  recommendations  through  the  Caribbean  Hotel  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy Action-Advanced Program (CHENACT), energy efficiency measures in homes and various LED lighting initiatives.  

iii.  Non-electrical energy efficiency: a 29% reduction in non-electric energy consumption  including  transport,  compared  to  a  BAU  scenario  in  2029 [^10].  GOB  is  investing  in  alternative vehicles and fuels such as compressed natural gas, liquid petroleum gas,  ethanol, natural gas, hybrid and electric and encouraging their adoption through tax  incentives.  

#### Waste Sector 

Aside from the energy sector, emissions from waste represent the other main contributor to  national GHG emissions (16% in 2008). Projects to divert waste from landfill and to develop  waste-to-energy plants are underway to deliver savings in this sector.

#### Fairness and Ambition 

Despite its negligible contribution to global GHG emissions  (approximately 0.004%) and its  SIDS  status,  Barbados  is  taking  significant  and  ambitious  steps  to  reduce  its  national  emissions. All of the country's identified mitigation actions are being targeted by the INDC,  which will result in per capita emissions of 4.8 tonnes CO2e in 2030 (compared to 6.6 tonnes  CO2e  in  2008),  consistent  with  the  projected  global  average  emissions  per  capita  in  2030  required  to  meet  the  1.5°C  above pre-industrial  levels  target [^18].  This projection  clearly  demonstrates  that  despite  Barbados'  SIDS  status,  its  ambition  to  reduce  emissions  is significant and reflects a fair contribution in the global context. 

### Planning Process 

##### Adaptation 

Barbados  has  set  up  the  NCCC,  coordinated  by the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Drainage (MED),  that  reports  on  the  development  and  implementation  of  all  specific  activities  and programmes  that  are  seeking  to  address  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation.  The  NCCC represents the diversity of stakeholders engaged in Barbados' national climate change  response, including relevant ministries, NGOs and private sector bodies. It is intended that the  NCCC  will  also  monitor  the implementation  and  directives  of  the  draft  NCCPF,  once  formally approved. The NCCC currently meets to report progress on sectoral activities on a  quarterly  basis  each  year.  Collectively,  the representatives  of  the  NCCC  keeps  the  policy  under  regular  review;  monitors  the  implementation its  directives;  and  presents  annual  reports  to  the  Cabinet  on  measures  that  have  been  undertaken  to  implement  this  policy. 

The  MED  has  coordinative  oversight  of  the  NCCC  and  the  implementation  of  the  NCCPF. Barbados has a number of ongoing programmes that are addressing adaptation as a central theme within these key sectors: 

-  Regional  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  System  for  Disaster  Risk  Management  (DRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) in the Caribbean Tourism Sector; 
-  Water Resource Management & Flood Resilience CCA Programme; 
-  Coastal Risk Assessment Programme; 
-  Piloting CCA to Protect human Health Project (Global Project by WHO/UNDP & GEF funded); 
-  Water Sanitation & Systems Upgrade; 
                                                           
[^18]: The global target to avoid 1.5°C of warming is 4.8 tCO2e per capita in 2030, assuming a global population of 8.2 billion (http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WUP2005/2005WUP_FS4.pdf) and global emissions of 39 GtCO2e (http://climateanalytics.org/files/ca_briefing_benchmark_emissions_1p5_and_2oc_2020_2025_2030_20150210_final_bh_may.pdf)". 

#### Mitigation 

Barbados  has  formalised  its  commitment  to the  mitigation  activities  summarised  above through the planning and implementation of various mitigation actions and other initiatives to reduce GHG emissions and green its economy, which include inter alia:  

-  Formulation  of  NAMA  at  the  national  level,  presenting  a  list  of  viable  projects  to reduce GHG emissions; 
-  The  Barbados  component  of  the  CHENACT  project,  associated  with  promoting  
energy-efficiency and renewable energy in the tourism industry for the country, has 
provided  a  CDM  Program  of  Activities  and  is  included  in  the  draft  energy  sector 
NAMA;  
-  National  Sustainable  Energy  Policy  and  associated  SEF  providing  top-down contributions for the energy and transport sectors; 
-  Green Economy Scoping Study and related activities; 
-  The CARICOM Declaration For Climate Action, calls for a legally binding commitment 
at COP21 for enhanced provisions for vulnerable countries and the  adoption of the limiting of long-term the global average temperature increase to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels; 
-  The  BRIDGE [^19] in  Sustainable  Energy  and Information  and  Communication 
Technologies  project  is  focused  on  developing  human  capital,  while  encouraging gender equality, to meet the expected future demand for technicians, professionals 
and  entrepreneurs  in  the  sustainable  energy  and  information  and  communication 
technology sectors; 
-  The  Resource  Efficient  Low  Carbon  and  Circular  Industrial  Partnership  Platform  for  Catalyzing Eco-Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Barbados(RECIPPEE-Barbados) is  a new partnership between the GOB and the United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization  (UNIDO)  which  will  help  Barbados  advance  a  number  of its development  priorities,  including  building  a  resource  efficient  green  economy  through inclusive and sustainable industrial development; 
-  Major contributions by the private sector in installing solar PV and other renewable 
energy  in  response  to  global  energy  prices, declining  renewable energy technology 
costs and government fiscal incentives. 

To accompany all of these actions, GOB is also taking steps to put systems and processes in 
place  to  institutionalise  a  formal  monitoring,  reporting  and  verification  (MRV)  system  to  track national emissions and the impact of specific mitigation actions. As the national focal point the MED will coordinate other related ministries and stakeholders in the preparation of required reports for monitoring progress, implementation and reporting to the UNFCCC  or otherwise as may be required.

### Means of Implementation 

Climate  change  is  a  cross-cutting  issue  that  affects  every  part  of  the  Barbadian  economy, social  structure  and  its'  natural  environment.  In  line  with  its  national  commitments  it  is  crucial  that  Barbados  continues  to  build  on  and  strengthen  its  ambition  to  achieve  the principles behind its sustainable develop policy, in addition to ensuring a low-carbon climate  resilient  society.  In doing  so,  Barbados  looks  to regional  and international  cooperation  for  support in order to progress the mitigation and adaptation priorities set out in its INDC, that  are in line with its national development objectives. 

Barbados  requires  substantial  assistance  to  meet  its  adaptation  objectives  set  out  in  its  INDC.  As  a  highly  vulnerable  SIDS,  Barbados  is  already  experiencing  frequent  and  major  climate  change  impacts  and  extreme  weather  events  that  could  decimate  its  economy  in  one  extreme  (climate  related)  event.  Such  impacts  will  be  an  ever  present  threat  for  the  country  and  will  continue  to  challenge  the  development  of  the  Barbadian  economy  as  a  whole. 



As  a  SIDS,  Barbados  will  require  significant  financial, technology  transfer  and  capacity-building  support  to  deliver  the intended  contribution  and  related infrastructure. International  grant  and  loan  financing  mechanisms  such  as  the  existing  ‘Energy  Smart Fund'[^20]  will  be  imperative  to  provide  financial  and  technical  support  to  renewable  energy and  energy  efficiency  projects  in  Barbados.  Initial  analysis  suggests  that  a  number  of  the planned renewable energy projects (linked to mitigation in the waste sector) in particular, provide  a  strong  economic  argument  to  stimulate  private  sector  investment;  however enabling  and  technology  transfer  support  will  still  be  required.  Mitigation  actions  in  the energy  efficiency  and  transport  sectors  will  be  largely  dependent  on  international  capital financing to implement and to achieve the relative contributions. 

Specifically international support will be crucial to the implementation of actions set out in its NCCPF (once formally approved), in addition to its SEF, NAMA and other sectoral policies and  plans.  The  flexibility  offered  by  the  existing  (i.e.  CDM)  and  future  emission  reduction mechanisms  under  the  UNFCCC  will  be  used  where  possible  to  achieve  Barbados' contribution domestically or jointly with regional/international partners.
