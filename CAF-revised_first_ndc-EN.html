  <h3>NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) REVISED VERSION</h3>
  <p>October 2021</p>
      <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
      <p>The revision of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is in line with the objectives pursued by the Government of the Central African Republic within the framework of the National Recovery and Peacebuilding Plan (RCPCA), the main planning instrument country strategy. It consolidates the achievements of the first generation of NDC and significantly improves it from a methodological point of view.</p>
      <p>It is based on the probable consequences of climate variations and changes projected for 2030, the evolution to date of emissions and absorptions of greenhouse gases, the impacts and existing and potential vulnerabilities, for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Describe a trend scenario (or <i>Business as Usual-BAU</i> Scenario ) of greenhouse gas emissions over the 2010-2030 cycle in the most emitting sectors: Energy; Agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU); industrial processes; Waste ;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Propose mitigation measures likely to bend the trend curve according to an unconditional scenario (investments granted by the State) and a conditional scenario (additional investment needs required from the international community)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Identify, according to a conditional scenario and an unconditional scenario, the adaptation measures in the most vulnerable sectors (Agriculture, Energy, Forestry, Water Resources, Health, Land use planning, Infrastructure and housing), in line with the objectives pursued through sector planning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
          <p>It thus appears, according to the trend scenario, an evolution of greenhouse gas emissions from 10,040 GgeCO2 in 2010 to 14,141 GgeqCO2 in 2025 and 17,644 GgeqCO2 in 2030. The sequestration capacity over the same horizons is respectively 730,714 GgCO2 and 733,607 GgCO2.</p>
          <p>The mitigation measures taken will generate, according to the unconditional scenario, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 9.03% and 11.82% respectively by 2025 and 2030 compared to the reference situation; and according to the conditional scenario 14.64% and 24.28% by 2025 and 2030 compared to the reference situation.</p>
          <p>CAR's NDC builds on the existing inventory of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCCPs), to broaden the spectrum of gases covered, in addition to greenhouse gases. Organic carbon emissions, which (CO) represent 61.9% of total PCCVD emissions, would experience a significant decline under the effect of the proposed mitigation measures at the same time as the other PCCVDs (13.67% at -55 ,31% depending on the type of pollutant by 2030).</p>
          <p>With regard to adaptation measures, the targeted actions proposed in the most vulnerable sectors should allow, by 2030, a decline in the impacts and a reduction in the vulnerabilities generated by current and future climate change.</p>
          <p>The financial needs associated with the implementation of all the actions thus described are estimated at $1.764 billion, including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>$1.32 billion for mitigation: $236 million unconditional and $1.08 billion conditional;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>$443.87 million for adaptation: $44.38 million unconditional and $399.48 million conditional.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  <p>The monitoring of the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures and of the support received in terms of technology, capacity building and financing, is ensured through a measurement, notification and verification system based on the national SDG monitoring system. This MRV system facilitates, among other things, the updating of inventories and the periodic reporting of the progress made by the CAR to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>

  <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>The revision of the CAR NDC responds to the urgency for ambitious action in the face of the global climate crisis and the rise in global temperature.</p>
  <p>In line with the first NDC of 2016 and the relevant provisions of decisions 1/CP.21, 4/CMA.1 and 9/CMA.1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the revised NDC confirms the country's aspiration to make a significant contribution to global efforts to combat climate change. This second generation presents significant advances compared to the first:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The formulation process was carried out in an inclusive manner, involving the various actors grouped around a multi-stakeholder Committee ensuring the strategic management and validation of the results, and sectoral working groups (six in total), responsible for proposing and/or amending the contribuions proposed, in terms of attenuation and adaptation. Thus, the data collected from primary suppliers is of better quality. Processing and analysis relied on the expertise of the official bodies in charge of sector statistics.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It covers more sectors and gases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The sectors and sub-sectors covered include, in addition to those of the first generation, transport, mining, land use planning and housing, in accordance with the recommendations of the evaluation report of the first NDC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Greenhouse gas coverage has been extended to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), in addition to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Better still, short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) have been taken into account, because of their potential role in reducing global warming.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The revised NDC relies on an improved and more robust database to estimate the emissions and removals of the reference scenario: the time series used is presented with annual data, unlike the first NDC, where the results summed over the time series 2003-2010, show overestimates, particularly in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. Also, the trend scenario or BAU scenario is more realistic and more credible, because it is built on more disaggregated and quality data, and covers more sectors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The implications of the corrections indicated <i>above</i> are a revision of the emissions of the trend scenario compared to the first NDC. They are 10,040 GgeCO2 in 2010 and 17,643 GgeCO2 by 2030.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The greenhouse gas emission reduction ambitions of the revised NDC are, in relative value, higher compared to the previous one (24.28% by 2030 compared to the trend scenario, compared to 5% for the first NDC). In absolute value, this reduction is less significant: it is 4,284.42 GgeCO2 against 5,500 GgeCO2 for the first NDC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The proposed mitigation measures incorporate the most realistic measures of the first NDC and consolidate them with new measures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Adaptation planning is made more robust by measures based on targeted objectives, consistent with sectoral objectives.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A measurement, notification and verification system is proposed.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>In view of the improvements that the review process has made possible, the CAR has in the medium term (horizon 2030) an effective tool for steering public actions that take into account the projected effects of climate change, and the means to mitigate these effects. effects.</p>

  <h2>2. COUNTRY CONTEXT</h2>
  <h3>CAR’S CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE</h3>
  <p>The climate in the Central African Republic is characterized by an upward trend in average annual temperature of around 0.3°C per decade, which began in the 1970s<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This variation, differentiated according to the climatic zones, increases more rapidly from 50s especially in the southwestern areas. Over the past thirty years, annual precipitation has shown a slight upward trend estimated at 8%<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This relative increase is accompanied by an upward trend in extreme events materialized by the increase in the number of rainy days with 10 mm of precipitation over the same period. The most marked climatic hazards in recent years have been storms, floods (South-West areas<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>), and droughts (in the North). Climatic conditions remain favorable to epidemics linked to bacterial and viral diseases. The probability of occurrence of annual epidemics of meningococcal meningitis during the dry season remains very high in the northern part which is in the meningitis belt.</p>

  <p>Table 1: Projected changes (Source: CCKP-2021 & GERICS-2015)</p>
  <p>Temperature projections show an increase of between 0.7 and 1.5°C by 2030 for the RCP 8.5 scenario, and an increase of 1.4 to 2.7°C by the middle of the 21st century<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> compared to the reference period 1986-2005 . Projections for annual precipitation indicate a slight upward trend in total annual precipitation<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>A probable increase in rainfall variability is expected, marked by an increase in the frequency (strong trend) and intensity (slight trend) of extreme events<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> likely to lead to occurrences of river flooding (see figure 3) on a large part of the country, and urban flooding in the regions of Ombelle Mpoko (Bangui) and Haute Kotto (Bria). With regard to dry periods, the highest risks are located in the regions of Vakaga and Haute Kotto.</p>

  <p>Figure 3: Risk of river, urban and drought flooding in CAR (source: ThinkHazard, 2021)</p>
  <p>At the macro-economic level, these projected changes pose all the more risks to the outlook for economic development, as the recovery phase initiated in 2017 has experienced shifts in 2018 and 2020, in terms of GDP growth rate. This rate, which should see a rebound effect, with the completion of energy projects and the resumption of agricultural and mining activities, can only be maintained if the impact of climate variability and change does not compromise, among other factors, the national ambitions. Indeed, in Central Africa a warming of 1°C above the historical average is associated with a decrease of around 0.7 percentage point in GDP growth, ranging from -1.3 to -0.03<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The table above shows the profile of greenhouse gas emissions (C02, CH4, N20, HFCs) in the following sectors: Energy; Agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU); industrial processes; Waste. The most significant emissions occur in the energy and AFOLU sectors, which represent nearly 94% of total volumes (see figure below).</p>

  <p>Figure 5: Breakdown of GHG emissions by sector (Source: Third National Communication)</p>
  <p>It should be noted, however, that despite its significant emissions, the CAR's forest and grassland ecosystems remain an important carbon sink, totaling an estimated sequestration capacity of 728,896 GgeCO2.</p>
  <p>On the same note, and based on the assumption of a potential reduction in short-term global warming of 0.4-0.5°C by 2050<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> by short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, their inventory has been completed<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Also, in addition to greenhouse gases (C02, CH4, N20, HFCs), the main sources of SLCP emissions remain the AFOLU and Energy sectors. The most emitting gases are, in order of importance: organic carbon (CO), suspended particles (PM10), and to a lesser extent nitrogen oxides (NOx), PM 2.5, non-volatile organic compounds methane (NMVOC).</p>

  <h2>3. MITIGATION of greenhouse gas emissions and climate pollutants</h2>
  <h3>VISION AND OBJECTIVES</h3>
  <p>CAR's mitigation vision is to promote low-carbon development, by reducing emissions by 10% to 25% by 2030 (unconditional and conditional scenario) compared to the trend scenario. It has several objectives: (i) the development of renewable energy resources and energy saving; (ii) promotion of agroecology; (iv) sustainable exploitation of natural resources; and (v) improvement of the living environment.</p>
  <p><strong>BAU SCENARIO OR TREND SCENARIO (2010-2030)</strong></p>
  <p>The trend scenario or Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for greenhouse gas emissions (C02, CH4, N20, HFCs) over the 2010-2030 cycle is shown below for the sectors: Energy; Agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU); industrial processes; Waste. CAR's emissions by 2025 and 2030 are respectively 14,141 GgeqCO2 and 17,644 GgeqCO2. The sequestration capacity on the same horizons remains high. It is respectively 730,714 GgCO2 and 733,607 GgCO2.</p>
  <p>For SLCPs, organic carbon (CO) is expected to account for 71% of short-lived climate pollutant emissions.</p>

  <p>Figure 8: Emission of PCCVD-Trend scenario (2010-2030)</p>
  <p>At the sectoral level, the mitigation measures set out below cover the activities for which investments are planned to be granted by the State (unconditional NDC), and the activities for which additional investment needs are required (conditional NDC ). For all the activities indicated <i>below</i> , the NDC will ensure equitable access to economic opportunities between genders and will target in particular young people and indigenous peoples in the areas where they are present.</p>

  <p><strong>ENERGY SECTOR</strong></p>
  <p>The National Energy Policy Document (DPEN) supports an objective of contributing to economic growth, improving the quality of life while respecting the environment by increasing the rate of access to electricity by 4 to 20% by 2025 and securing the energy supply. This ambition is broken down for each sub-sector: traditional energies, electricity, new and renewable energies, hydrocarbons, energy management and saving.</p>
  <p>In line with these ambitions, the NDC of the CAR structures its intervention in the field of energy, according to the actions and objectives below.</p>

  <p><strong>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND OTHER LAND USE SECTOR (AFOLU)</strong></p>
  <p>The Strategy for Rural Development, Agriculture and Food Security (SDRASA) is structured around a vision for 2025 of Central African agriculture that is "productive, profitable, respectful of the environment, based on local initiatives and the concept of gender, creator of wealth, and the conditions for the emergence of a dynamic agricultural private sector”. It includes in its programming support for the management of natural resources and the development and dissemination of sustainable agricultural practices, as major axes of its policy. The SDRASA is supplemented by the National Agricultural Investment Program for Food and Nutritional Security (PNIASAN) which focuses, among other things, on the revival of food-producing sectors and the development of export sectors (cotton, coffee, palm oil).</p>
  <p>In the field of forestry, the CAR has the ambition that "by 2035, forest ecosystems and the resources associated with them will be co-managed for the goods and services necessary for peace, sustainable development and harmonious, for the conservation of biological diversity and for the protection of the global environment". This vision is reflected in the National REDD+ Investment Framework 2020-2025 which aims to support the country in the economic and social development of the AFOLU sector while ensuring that impacts on forest ecosystems are avoided, minimized and compensated. .</p>
  <p>In these areas, the objectives and mitigation measures are as follows:</p>

  <p><strong>WASTE SECTOR</strong></p>
  <p>The national water and sanitation strategy document pursues, at the level of the sanitation sub-sector, several sub-objectives, including the improvement of the living environment and the health of the population; the development of action strategies in terms of hygiene and solid<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>, liquid and excreta waste in rural and urban areas. This ambition continues within the framework of the National Water Policy (2020-2030) which has included in its strategic axes “access for all to water and sanitation by 2030”. In the continuity of such an approach, the rational and sustainable management of waste remains a major challenge for municipalities in general, and urban ones in particular, in a context of increasing urban population estimated at 41.4% of the population,</p>
  <p>In this area, the objectives and mitigation measures relate to the treatment and recovery of municipal waste. The examination, treatment and analysis of the proposed mitigation measures show that in the context of the CAR, they are (i) either likely to generate methane emissions which are added to the emissions of the trend scenario, (ii ) or the reduction percentage remains marginal (less than 1%) compared to the costs induced by the action. Thus, no measure is proposed under this component.</p>

  <p><strong>INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USE SECTOR (PIUP)</strong></p>
  <p>The legal framework for national climate action is mainly based on Law No. 07/018 of December 28, 2007 on the Environmental Code, which enshrines air protection, as one of its priority interventions. The country has also ratified the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol which aims for the reduction and complete elimination of substances that deplete the ozone layer.</p>
  <p>In view of the commitments made by the country in this area, the NDC mitigation measures in this area are as follows:</p>

  <h2>4. ADAPTATION TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
  <h3>VISION AND OBJECTIVE</h3>
  <p>The national vision of the CAR on climate change is that "by 2030, the Central African Republic is part of a dynamic of sustained, equitable and sustainable socio-economic development, because integrating the challenges of climate change in all sectors social and productive which will allow an improvement of the general well-being of its population”.</p>
  <p>In the continuity of such a vision, and in coherence with the adaptation objectives of the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the priority orientations defined by the Government, the objective aimed at in terms of adaptation is "to improve by 2030 the resilience of communities and ecosystems in the socio-economic sectors most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change”.</p>
  <h3>IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION MEASURES</h3>
  <p>At the national level, vulnerability is more marked in areas included in the National Plan for Recovery and Consolidation of Peace 2017-2021 (RCPCA) as Government priorities. These are: Agriculture, Energy, Forestry, Water Resources, Health, Land Use Planning, Infrastructure and Housing. It is exacerbated by political insecurity and inequalities, in a context marked by an amplification of gender inequality, the index of which is considered one of the highest in the world. The country is indeed ranked 159th out of 162 countries according to the 2019 United Nations Gender Inequality Index (GII). This inequality has increased in recent decades due to successive crises, with an index that has increased from 0.743 in 1995 to 0.680 in 2019.</p>
  <p>The table below presents in detail the sectoral impacts and vulnerabilities, in relation to the expected effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>Despite the socio-economic situation of the country (188th country out of 189 in the HDI), the CAR aims to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at the global level, according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. The revised NDC covers more sectors and gases. It presents, in relative value, higher ambitions compared to the previous one (24.28% for the revised NDC and 5% for the first NDC), and less important in absolute value: 4,284.42 GgeCO2 against 5,500 GgeCO2 for the first NDC. This difference is due to the revision of the BAU scenario which is more realistic, as it is based on more data and more sectors.</p>
          <p>The country is a major carbon sink (728,896 GgeCO2), which it aims to protect and advance through the proposed sequestration measures. Better still, from a conceptual point of view, it introduces a new approach which could be of interest to other countries towards low carbon development.</p>
