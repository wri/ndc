  <h1>Côte d'Ivoire's Nationally Determined Contributions</h1>
  <h2>PREFACE</h2>
  <p>Our planet is currently facing major environmental problems such as the degradation of coastal zones, the loss of biodiversity, the modification of cropping seasons, the accentuation of drought. The current economic development model using conventional energies without taking into account the principles of sustainable development risks causing significant damage to the environment.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, a more responsible and low-carbon economic development policy could make it possible to limit the negative impacts on the environment and guarantee a more viable planet for future generations. Aware of these issues, Côte d'Ivoire ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1994, as well as the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. Subsequently, Côte d'Ivoire joined the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in 2005, the REDD+ Mechanism in 2012 and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) in 2012.</p>
    <p>With the end of the commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement was adopted. Its main objective is to keep the increase in global temperature “well below” 2°C by striving to limit it to 1.5°C.</p>
    <p>Thus, Côte d'Ivoire is resolutely committed to contributing to the achievement of this global objective, taking into account not only the challenges of structural transformation of its economy and sustainable development, but also by adopting a low-carbon development trajectory in a context of post-Covid19 economic recovery.</p>
    <p>“Climate change is a real concern (…) we must act quickly and responsibly if we want to preserve our living environment and our planet”. This declaration made by Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, on the occasion of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, held in September 2017, inspires all the climate action of the Ivorian Government. </p>
    <p>Côte d'Ivoire has already submitted three (3) National Communications on climate change, successively in 2000, 2010 and 2017. The Fourth National Communication (QCN) is currently being drafted.</p>
    <p>In 2015, ahead of the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, Côte d'Ivoire submitted its first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, the objective of which was to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 28.25%.</p>
    <p>To respond to the call to raise climate ambition, Côte d'Ivoire has undertaken to raise its mitigation targets, strengthen its adaptive resilience and accelerate forest, land and , energy to contribute effectively to the fight against poverty. Its current ambition is to reduce its GHG emissions by 30.41% (taking into account the forestry sector not targeted in the first Nationally Determined Contributions of 2015), for an overall cost estimated at twenty-two (22) billion US dollars. The coal option was also abandoned in favor of an energy mix that includes a high proportion of renewable energies (45%) and natural gas power plants. The climate policy of the Ivorian Government also emphasizes the resilience of the most vulnerable groups, in particular women and young people, through the creation of green jobs and financing issues.</p>
    <p>The Government will ensure that efforts to preserve the environment lead to the reduction of the harmful impacts of climate change on the national economy and to the improvement of the living conditions of the populations. As a result, Côte d'Ivoire is proud to present its revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the period 2021-2030. It thus reaffirms its commitment to contribute to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gases. . This commitment is reflected in its policy of reconstitution and preservation of its forest massif, its energy potential with its hydrographic network, its combined cycle natural gas power stations and the increased use of renewable energies. As a result, our country has all the potential to become a real carbon sink.</p>

  <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
  <p>In 2015, Côte d'Ivoire made a commitment, through its first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) ahead of COP21 in Paris, to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 28.25%, i.e. a reduction of approximately ten (10) million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent by 2030 compared to the Business as Usual or reference scenario.</p>
  <p>The evaluation of the said NDCs revealed some shortcomings, in particular the failure to take forestry into account in the estimates and the lack of a performance monitoring and evaluation system with regard to the country's climate commitments. Thus, in accordance with the requirements of the Paris Agreement, the State of Côte d'Ivoire has carried out a revision of its NDCs by updating the efforts to reduce GHGs (mitigation) as well as the assessment of its vulnerability and options. adaptation to climate change.</p>
  <p>This review process, which started in February 2020, allowed for broad consultation with strategic national stakeholders, including key ministries, the private sector, civil society and local authorities. At the end of these consultations, Côte d'Ivoire raises its climate ambition to 30.41% corresponding to a reduction of thirty-seven (37) million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by all sectors, including Forestry and other Land Uses (FAT), by 2030 compared to the new reference scenario. This unconditional contribution consists of a reduction of 13.2 million tonnes of GHG emissions resulting from the implementation of measures in the energy, waste and agriculture sectors (corresponding to a reduction of 10.5% of total national GHG emissions in 2030 compared to the reference scenario), and a reduction of 23.8 million tonnes of GHG emissions resulting from the implementation of measures in the Forestry sector and other Land Uses (corresponding to a 19.6% reduction in total national GHG emissions in 2030 compared to the reference scenario). Côte d'Ivoire could increase its ambition in terms of mitigating GHG emissions, provided it receives financial support additional internationals. Thus, for the energy, waste and agriculture sectors, the GHG mitigation ambition could increase from an overall reduction in emissions of 13.2 to 17.2 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent in 2030. compared to the reference scenario.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the inclusion of additional measures in the Forestry and other Land Use sector could bring the overall GHG mitigation ambition to a 98.95% reduction in total emissions by 2030 compared to the reference scenario, resolutely committing the country to carbon neutrality from 2030.</p>
  <p>The mitigation component includes thirty-eight (38) measures including twenty-seven (27) unconditional and eleven (11) conditional, the implementation of which is estimated at around ten (10) billion US$.</p>
  <p>With regard to the adaptation component, it aims to achieve a reduction in high vulnerability by 2030 and to increase the resilience of the identified sectors, which are: water resources, agriculture, livestock and water resources. aquaculture, forestry, land use, health as well as coastal areas. The implementation of adaptation measures is estimated at around twelve (12) billion US$.</p>
  <p>Beyond the mitigation and adaptation aspects, the revision of the NDCs also took into account cross-cutting aspects such as green jobs and just transition, gender, local authorities, and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) whose reduction would also make it possible to avoid more than 7,000 premature deaths per year by 2030.</p>
  <p>Also, the implementation of these NDCs will be based on (i) an investment plan which will make it possible to specify the costs and to mobilize all the adequate means both at the national and international level, (ii ) a partnership plan which will highlight the key sectoral needs, (iii) a monitoring-evaluation plan for optimal and efficient implementation of the measures defined and, (iv) a communication strategy to popularize the results.</p>

  <h2>COTE D’IVOIRE’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION</h2>
  <h3>NATIONAL SITUATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
    <p><strong>Ambition of Côte d'Ivoire</strong></p>
    <p>The Paris Agreement, as a new universal instrument for the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has set itself the objective of limiting the increase warming to 2°C, or even 1.5°C by 2100. With regard to this objective, the countries have made commitments which should be reviewed periodically every five (5) years. In this context, Côte d'Ivoire, like the countries that are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, developed and submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2015. These essentially provided for: i) a 28.25% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 compared to a reference scenario; and (ii) improving the resilience of eleven (11) strategic development sectors vulnerable to climate change. The country has thus demonstrated its desire to embark on a low-carbon development path that is resilient to climate change.</p>
    <p>As part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, Côte d'Ivoire is providing some responses to the shortcomings identified in its first NDCs during its review process. Indeed, one of the major difficulties of the first NDCs was the impossibility of monitoring and evaluating the initiatives implemented in relation to the final objective. Through this revision, the country intends to reiterate its desire to reduce the carbon footprint of its development by favoring mitigation measures, strengthening its resilience to climate change and developing a coherent implementation strategy. The country also intends to strengthen its planning and monitoring system for its commitments under the Paris Agreement with a view to the effective implementation of its climate policy.</p>
    <p>Côte d'Ivoire's new contribution, the result of an inclusive and participatory process, presents an unconditional ambition of 30.41% corresponding to an abatement of thirty-seven (37) million tonnes equivalent</p>
    <p>CO<sub>2</sub> in 2030 compared to the new reference scenario. This unconditional contribution is based on the implementation of twenty-seven (27) measures out of the thirty-eight (38) mitigation measures assessed as part of this review. Côte d'Ivoire could increase its ambition in terms of mitigating GHG emissions, provided it receives appropriate levels of international financial support. Indeed, the inclusion of eleven (11) additional conditional measures in the implementation of the NDCs could bring the overall ambition of GHG mitigation to a reduction of 98.95% of total emissions in 2030 compared to the scenario of reference, thus resolutely committing the country to carbon neutrality from 2030.</p>
    <p>With regard to the adaptation component, it aims to achieve by 2030 a reduction in vulnerability and a strengthening of the resilience of the identified sectors, which are: water resources, agriculture, livestock and aquaculture, forestry, land use, health and coastal areas.</p>
    <p>Thus, the new NDC of Côte d'Ivoire represents a much more ambitious and balanced contribution of the efforts that the country intends to undertake to contribute to the global effort. Based on the conclusions of the recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Côte d'Ivoire is expanding the range of measures and sectors considered as well as the gases targeted, making it possible to increase nearly four (4) times (10 million vs 37 million CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent), the initial ambition to reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) while opening up the prospects for achieving carbon neutrality and sustainable development from of 2030.</p>
    <p><strong>Côte d'Ivoire's commitments</strong></p>
    <p>Côte d'Ivoire, like the countries Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), continues to reiterate its commitment to work with all countries to the achievement of the objectives of the said Convention, enshrined in its Article 2 and reinforced by Article 2 of the Paris Climate Agreement. Thus, Côte d'Ivoire's action on climate change is based on a vision municipality which is to <i>"put in place a framework for sustainable socio-economic development which integrates the challenges of climate change in all sectors and which contributes to the improvement of the living conditions of the populations and their resilience"</i>.</p>
      <p>Indeed, since 1994, the country has adhered to international protocols and action plans aimed at the operational implementation of the Convention. Which adherence was manifested by the ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1994) and its protocols, in particular the Kyoto Protocol (2007) and the Paris Agreement (2016).</p>
      <p>This commitment resulted in the establishment in 2005 of a National Authority in charge of the Clean Development Mechanism (AN-CDM) resulting from the Kyoto Protocol. Then, in 2011, the State of Côte d'Ivoire joined the Mechanism for the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). This commitment was then consolidated in 2012, with the creation of a National Program for the Fight against Climate Change (PNCC) followed by membership in 2013 of the Coalition for Climate and Clean Air (CCAC) for the reduction of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP). In 2015, the country embarked on the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process. To the day after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the framework for climate action in Côte d'Ivoire took a decisive turn with the creation of a Central Department in charge of the Fight against Climate Change (DLCC) in 2016 to coordinate climate action.</p>
      <p>This reaffirms Côte d'Ivoire's desire to raise climate change to the rank of national priority. Moreover, by drawing up the National Development Plan (PND) 2021-2025, which is the reference document for national development planning, the State has devoted one of the six (06) priority areas, in particular the axis 5 to the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p>This revised NDC document is intended as a tool to help identify and assess the needs and means of integrating actions to combat climate change in sectoral plans and policies (see Table I ).</p>
      <p>Despite this manifest political will, much remains to be done both in terms of mobilizing public and private actors and in terms of operationalizing policies and strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change, including issues related to gender (see Boxes 1 and 2).</p>

      <p><strong>BOX 1 INTEGRATION OF GENDER-RELATED ISSUES IN CLIMATE ACTION IN COTE D'IVOIRE</strong></p>
        <p>In order to take gender issues into account in climate action in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MINEDD) , has developed initiatives to mobilize and engage key stakeholders at the national level, which resulted in the development in 2019 of a National Gender and Climate Change Strategy (2020-2024).</p>
        <p>It should be noted, among other things, the establishment of mechanisms for discussion, sharing of experiences and capacity building on the link between gender and climate which led to a "structured dialogue".</p>
        <p>This dynamic is reinforced by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development and the Minister of Women, Family and Children, on October 25, 2021 This high-level political commitment aims to strengthen the advocacy process for the systematic integration of the gender and climate nexus into sectoral plans, strategic and policy documents at the national level.</p>
        <p>As part of the integration of the gender and climate theme, gender is taken into account across all the priority sectors identified in the NDCs. Thus, it is a question of analyzing: (i) in terms of mitigation, the differentiated responsibility of men and women in the mechanisms of emissions and/or reduction of Greenhouse Gases and (ii) in terms of adaptation, the differentiated situation of men and women in relation to vulnerability risks and impact chains in order to strengthen the gender component in the National Adaptation Plan.</p>

        <p><strong>BOX 2 HIGHLIGHTS OF THE REVISED NDCs</strong></p>
        <h4>IN TERMS OF MITIGATION</h4>
        <p>Côte d'Ivoire's updated global objective represents an economy-wide reduction of GHG emissions of 30.41% in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, using national means, and a conditional reduction 98.95% by 2030 compared to the reference scenario, subject to appropriate international financial support. The mitigation scenario leading to the overall objective of 30.41%, the implementation of which is estimated at ten (10) billion US$, could create approximately 34,800 jobs in all sectors.</p>
        <p><strong>IN TERMS OF ADAPTATION</strong></p>
        <p>Adaptation is a priority for Côte d'Ivoire given its high vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The cost of implementing adaptation programs in the most affected sectors is estimated at nearly US$12 billion. The priority sectors concerned are water resources, agriculture including livestock and aquaculture, forestry and land use, health and coastal zones. Adaptation measures to the numbers of twenty (20) could create 580,000 to 870,000 jobs.</p>
        <p><strong>CROSS-CUTTING ASPECTS</strong></p>
        <p>Taking into account cross-cutting aspects such as gender, territorialization of climate action, green jobs, health and air pollution in the implementation of NDCs would generate significant co-benefits. Thus, taking gender into account can significantly improve climate governance, particularly in rural areas. As for the territorialization of the NDCs, it will make it possible to integrate climate concerns into local development plans, policies and strategies. With regard to green jobs, they constitute a double boon through participation in the reduction of unemployment on the one hand, and the development of an economic model that is more respectful of the environment and human beings on the other. Finally, the reduction of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) would also make a significant contribution towards GHG mitigation, to avoid more than 7,000 premature deaths due to exposure to fine particles by 2030, thus contributing to the improvement of air quality, the health of populations and to sustainable development.</p>
        <p><strong>FINANCING AND INVESTMENT FLOWS</strong></p>
        <p>The implementation of NDCs requires significant investments that exceed the capacity of the Ivorian state. It therefore requires enhanced cooperation between the Ivorian State, the private sector and international financial institutions, including new climate financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the financial instruments of multilateral development banks. Furthermore, Côte d'Ivoire considers, as essential, the establishment of market and non-market mechanisms in order to promote cooperation between countries, as provided for in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, in particular , by reducing the total costs to achieve the objective of limiting the rise in temperatures set out in article 2 of the said Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>ABANDONING COAL AS AN ENERGY SOURCE</strong></p>
        <p>The construction of the San-Pedro coal-fired power station was one of the last major projects related to the use of coal as a source of energy in Africa. With an initial capacity of 1400 MW then reduced to 700 MW, it should see the light of day in 2024. The plant was supposed to supply electricity to the industrial infrastructures of San-Pedro as well as a large part of Côte d'Ivoire. However, given environmental and climatic issues, natural gas fuel has been replaced by coal. The abandonment of coal fuel clearly reiterates the new vision of Côte d'Ivoire to favor clean energies in order to move towards a low carbon economic model.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 1: MITIGATION</h2>
        <p>The economic development of Côte d'Ivoire is based on the increase and intensification of agricultural production, agro-industrial processing, the development of transport, trade and services. This pressing need for development in no way taints the country's political will to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions by preserving the environment and accelerating the use of clean energies. This desire is translated into sectoral strategic plans and national strategies on which the revised NDCs are based.</p>

              <p>The mitigation objectives of the revised NDCs are expressed in relation to a reference scenario corresponding to a change in GHG emissions by 2030, starting from 2012 as the base year.</p>
              <p>This choice is justified by two main reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>2012 is the most recent year used for the development of GHG inventories in the Third National Communication (TCN). However, according to the first updated biennial report of Côte d'Ivoire (BUR1), the inventories of GHG emissions were assessed over the period 1990-2014. Data for 2013 and 2014 in the Energy sector not being available, they have therefore been reconstituted.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>2012 is the base year for the first version of Côte d'Ivoire's NDCs which did not include forestry. On this basis, 2012 constitutes a benchmark for comparison between the two versions of CDNs.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The baseline scenario reflects a population growth rate of about 2.5 percent per year and an economic growth rate of about 6 percent per year, consistent with recent historical GDP growth in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
              <p>The target year for our new ambition will remain 2030 in line with the initial NDCs. However, GHG emissions will be assessed each year between the base year 2012 and the target year 2030 for all the scenarios in order to ensure better monitoring of the implementation of our NDCs. Figure 1 presents the global reference scenario for GHG emissions from all sectors for the period 2012-2030.</p>
              <p>A full description of the methods and sectoral approaches used to quantify GHG sources and sinks from all sectors is provided in the report "Integrated Assessment of Greenhouse Gases, Short-lived Climate Pollutants and Air Pollutants". in Côte d'Ivoire: Recommendations for the revision of the NDCs”, which summarizes the GHG mitigation assessment carried out to inform this update of the NDCs.</p>

              <h3>1.2. OVERALL OBJECTIVE: UNCONDITIONAL AND CONDITIONAL MEASURES</h3>
              <p>The scenario of unconditional mitigation measures includes twenty-seven (27) measures on which Côte d'Ivoire commits within the framework of its NDCs taking into account its national circumstances and capacities. As for the conditional mitigation measures, there are eleven (11) of them. Their implementation depends on increased external support and financial support.</p>
              <p>The revised NDCs present an unconditional mitigation target of 30.41% corresponding to a reduction of thirty-seven (37) million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent by 2030 compared to the reference scenario; while the conditional objective is increased to 98.95% (unconditional and conditional measures) by 2030 compared to the reference scenario. This new objective marks an exceptional increase in the mitigation ambition compared to the first version of the NDCs while highlighting the prospects for achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. All the measures to achieve this overall mitigation goal is presented in Annex I.</p>

              <h3>1.3. SECTORAL DISTRIBUTION</h3>
              <p>The revised NDCs include thirty-eight (38) mitigation measures (twenty-seven (27) unconditional measures and eleven (11) conditional measures) as indicated in Annex I. Regarding the twenty-seven (27) unconditional measures, several are already partially or fully implemented. These will continue to mitigate GHG emissions over the 2020-2030 period.</p>

              <h3>1.4. CO-BENEFITS OF MITIGATING SHORT-LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS (SLCP) AND OTHER AIR POLLUTANTS</h3>
        <p>By undertaking the GHG mitigation assessment for this update of the NDCs, the reduction in emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) and atmospheric pollutants resulting from the implementation of the mitigation measures have also been quantified. Côte d'Ivoire takes note of the results of the 2018 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on global warming at 1.5 degrees Celcius, which indicates that there is no There is no way to limit temperature rise to less than 1.5°C without large-scale reductions in short-lived climate pollutants like methane, black carbon and hydrofluorocarbons. The population of the Côte d'Ivoire also suffers the effects of emissions of short-lived climate pollutants and air pollutants on their health, due to exposure to high levels of indoor and outdoor pollution.</p>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 34,000 premature deaths per year in Côte d'Ivoire are associated with exposure to air pollution.</p>
        <p>As a member of the Coalition for Climate and Clean Air (CCAC) since 2013, Côte d'Ivoire is committed to taking integrated measures that simultaneously improve air quality in Côte d'Ivoire, while mitigating climate change. In 2020, Côte d'Ivoire published its national plan to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. This plan identified 16 specific measures targeting the main sources of air pollutants and short-lived climate pollutants, which could significantly reduce emissions of black carbon, methane, fine particles, but also simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The implementation of Côte d'Ivoire's national plan to reduce short-lived climate pollutants could therefore contribute substantially to achieving the updated targets described in these NDCs.</p>
        <p>The GHG mitigation assessment for this NDC update incorporated some of the mitigation measures included in the National Short-Lived Climate Pollutants Reduction Plan. Consequently, the implementation of the revised NDCs of Côte d'Ivoire should make it possible to obtain substantial benefits in terms of reducing short-lived climate pollutants and air pollutants in general and improving air quality and public health.</p>
        <p>Thus the revised NDCs should make it possible, compared to the reference scenario, to reduce:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Black carbon (BC) emissions by 58% in 2030;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Methane (CH4) emissions by 30% in 2030;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Particle (PM) emissions by 64% in 2030;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 42% in 2030.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
            <p>In addition, HydroFluoroCarbide (HFC) emissions would be reduced by 20% in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, as Côte d'Ivoire begins to implement the Kigali Amendment. These emission reductions would be further increased after 2030, in line with the HFC phase-out schedule provided for by the Kigali Amendment.</p>
            <p>Due to the simultaneous reduction of SLCPs and air pollutants in addition to GHGs as Côte d'Ivoire implements its NDCs, the effects of improving indoor and outdoor air quality have been estimated at about 7,000 premature deaths avoided per year in 2030, thus considerably improving public health. The main mitigation measures of Côte d'Ivoire's revised NDCs that lead to substantial reductions in SLCPs and other air pollutants are presented in Annex I.</p>

            <p><strong>BOX 3: MITIGATION COMPARISON NDC 2015 / NDC REVISED</strong></p>
            <p>In Côte d'Ivoire's NDCs, the target for reducing GHG emissions in 2030 was approximately ten (10) million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent compared to the 2015 reference scenario. This target corresponded to a reduction of 28.25%. These emission reductions were distributed among seven (07) sectors (Power Generation, Transport, Industry, Energy Supply, Buildings, Agriculture, Waste). However, several key sources and strategic cross-cutting sectors were not included in the 2015 NDCs and have been taken into account in this revision of the NDCs.</p>
            <p>The main differences between the revised NDCs and the 2015 NDCs are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The seven (07) sectors considered in the mitigation component of the 2015 NDCs to assess GHG emissions have been grouped into four (04) strategic sectors which are: Energy (electricity production, transport, industry and buildings), Waste, Agriculture and Forestry;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The inclusion of the Forestry and other Land Uses sector provides a good basis for further increasing the ambition of GHG mitigation, by achieving the objectives of the Strategy for the Preservation, Rehabilitation and Extension of Forests from Côte d'Ivoire ;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Taking into account the new master plan for the production and transmission of electricity devoting the abandonment of coal in favor of natural gas as a source of energy for the future thermal power station of San-Pédro;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The reduction efforts estimated at approximately 10 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (28.25%) have evolved. In the revised NDCs, the set of unconditional measures without forestry represents 13.2 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (25%) of GHG reduction compared to the new reference level (without emissions from the TSF sector);</p>
        <p>By adding forestry, the reduction efforts represent thirty-seven (37) million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (30.41%) reduction compared to the new reference scenario;</p>
      </li>
          <li>
            <p>In the revised NDCs, it is planned to update and implement the national SLCP reduction plan. This reduction could reinforce the mitigation ambition as well as offer substantial co-benefits for the improvement of air quality and human health (more than 7,000 premature deaths avoided per year by 2030) thanks to reduced air pollution;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In addition to methane and HFC reductions that contribute to overall GHG mitigation, emissions of air pollutants such as black carbon, nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter can be significantly reduced through the implementation of mitigation measures. mitigation including switching to cleaner fuels for cooking, transport, power generation and industries;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Strategic sectors such as Green Jobs, Territorialization and Gender have made it possible to highlight the co-benefits and bring qualitative added value to the measures defined in the revised NDCs.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CHAPTER 2: ADAPTATION</h2>
              <h3>2.1. IMPACTS AND VULNERABILITY</h3>
              <p>Ranked 144th out of 169 countries for its ND-GAIN index, Côte d'Ivoire is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change due to its geographical location, its economic structure and its weak preparation to deal with the adverse effects. climate change. Agriculture, representing ¼ of the country's GDP and more than half of jobs, is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also negatively impacted by the rise in temperatures and the change in the precipitation regime with negative repercussions on agricultural productivity and more generally on food security.</p>
              <p>In addition, across Africa, the area of arid and semi-arid lands could increase by 5 to 8% by 2080<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The coastal coastal plains, home to 30% of the Ivorian population and 80% of the country's economic activities, are already strongly affected by the harmful effects of climate change which accentuates the rise in sea level and coastal erosion, thus endangering human lives, in particular for people living on the coast.</p>
              <p>Nationwide, climate change threatens to push almost a million additional Ivorians into extreme poverty<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, to increase the risk of water stress, with more and more regions see more than 10% of their population in water shortage, and to increase the resurgence of diseases associated with air and water<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> among susceptible populations. Women are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of climate change due to the division of labor and gender roles, economic disparities and imbalances in hardship and time devoted to domestic tasks, which penalize their opportunities for adaptation.</p>
              <h3>2.2. OBJECTIVES FOR 2030</h3>
              <p>The objective for 2030 of the adaptation component is to reduce the vulnerability and increase the resilience of the five (5) sectors identified as priorities, namely:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Agriculture, livestock, aquaculture;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Forests and land use;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Water resources;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Health;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Coastal areas.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Gender, biodiversity and territorialization are considered cross-cutting priorities for all sectors. All the measures to reduce vulnerability, strengthen the resilience and adaptation capacities of sectors, local communities and national actors are presented in Annex 2.</p>
              <h3>2.3. EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON PRIORITY SECTORS</h3>
              <p>In Côte d'Ivoire, the negative repercussions of climate change are perceptible in many sectors, the main ones being the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Agriculture, livestock, aquaculture: (i) modification of the agricultural calendar, drop in production volumes for certain crops, (ii) changes in climatic zones favorable to crops, (iii) degradation and reduction of pastures and increase risk of livestock mortality.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Forests and land use: (i) forest decline, (ii) increased risk of forest fires and increased soil degradation and desertification which will reinforce gender inequalities, especially in terms of access to arable land .</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Water resources: (i) drop in surface water availability for the Bandama and Sassandra rivers, (ii) sharp drop in groundwater load, (iii) increase in surface water evapotranspiration (particularly in Comoé), (iv) poor spatio-temporal distribution of water resources and increased risk of drought.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Health: (i) increase in air temperature, coupled with drought and dust (sand, pollen, etc.) can lead to the resurgence or development of respiratory (asthma) and cardiovascular diseases, (ii) increase in waves of extreme heat with intense effects on pregnant women and women in the menopause phase, (iii) variability of - heavy - rainfall could amplify the risks of vector-borne diseases (malaria, dengue fever), and the insufficiency of evacuation, can carry bacteria causing water-borne and diarrheal diseases (cholera).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Coastal areas: (i) intensification of coastal erosion in recent decades in Côte d'Ivoire with worrying erosion of the low sandy coast recording shoreline retreat speeds of the order of 1 to 3 meters or more in places (Abidjan, Grand-Lahou), (ii) increased risk of flooding and marine submersion.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>2.4. BARRIERS AND GAPS IN PRIORITY SECTORS</h3>
              <p>The main obstacles and gaps encountered in the implementation of adaptation measures relate to the following sectors:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Agriculture, livestock, aquaculture: (i) insufficient awareness and training of farmers in terms of marketing agricultural products (organization), (ii) failure to take into account the specific needs of women in the training programs technical, (iii) lack of control of water resources, (iv) poor access to biofertilizers and lack of planning, (v) insufficient observational data and appropriate climate services.</p>
                </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Forests and land use: (i) inappropriate anthropogenic practices, (ii) insufficient technical capacities, financial resources of state structures and communities, (iii) precariousness of the land tenure system leading to land conflicts, (iv) poor knowledge of the floors.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Water resources: (i) difficulties in coordination between state agencies, (ii) lack of reliable and relevant information, particularly in terms of functional hydrometric networks and hydrometeorological networks.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Health: (i) weak institutional memory in terms of data archiving, (ii) low proportion of the State budget allocated to the health sector, (iii) weak dissemination and application of procedures for managing health infrastructure and equipment, (iv) insufficient medical staff, (v) insufficient epidemiological alert systems to anticipate climate-related diseases, (vi) little knowledge of the links between climate change and health.</p>
                        </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Coastal areas: (i) low consideration of adaptation measures in coastal areas linked to the high cost of infrastructure to be built, (ii) destructive human action on ecosystems such as mangroves, (iii) instability of mouthpieces.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
              <h3>2.5. ADAPTATION MEASURES IN PRIORITY SECTORS</h3>
              <p>The measures identified in the different priority sectors of the adaptation component are as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Agriculture, livestock, aquaculture: (i) put in place measures to protect against climate risks, (ii) promote agricultural practices that protect the soil, (iii) support agro-pastoral and fisheries systems that are climate-smart and protect natural resources .</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Forests and land use: (i) improving land governance, (ii) strengthening forest protection and combating land degradation, (iii) restore degraded lands and forests.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Water resources: (i) support Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), (ii) strengthen technology transfer for better water resource management.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Health: (i) strengthen surveillance of sensitive diseases linked to climate change, (ii) strengthen technical capacities to deal with a resurgence of diseases linked to climate change, (iii) strengthen institutional capacities and intersectoral collaboration.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Coastal zones: (i) strengthening the technical and financial capacities of institutions and all stakeholders for the integrated management of coastal zones, (ii) setting up an early warning system, (iii) supporting local communities more vulnerable through physical and social investments.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>2.6. NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLAN (NAP)</h3>
        <p>The orientation law on sustainable development No. 2014-390 of June 20, 2014 provides a legal basis for the NAP which is part of a broader and integrated approach to environmental protection and sustainable development.</p>
        <p>Thus in 2015, the year in which the country's first NDCs were submitted, the NAP process began with consultations for the development of a roadmap with the support of the NAP global support programme. In March 2017, a project proposal to strengthen the integration of adaptation to climate change in development planning in Côte d'Ivoire was submitted to the Green Climate Fund via the "Readiness Adaptation" window, approved in February 2019.</p>
        <p>Thus, several activities were undertaken as a prelude to the development of the NAP. These are specific studies on adaptation, the private sector, the roles and responsibilities of actors in the development and implementation cycle of the NAP, methodological guides and risk assessment reports. climate change, quantification of impacts and costs of adaptation options. Synergies with other technical and financial partners are underway, with a view to developing structuring projects on adaptation, the structuring of the vertical approach to adaptation and the sustainability of certain interventions.</p>
        <p>In addition, the feasibility of certain financial instruments, applied to adaptation, such as climate insurance are realized. Several consultations have been initiated on the Gender component and have resulted in the establishment of a gender and climate change platform and the development of advocacy for the attention of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development and the Ministry in charge of Women, Family and Children. This advocacy resulted in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on gender and climate change, in 2020 between the two ministries.</p>
        <p>Training workshops based on targeted programs have been rolled out. The improvement of the institutional framework through a better knowledge of the constituents linked to the NAP process has been initiated. Analyzes of the Measurement-Notification-Verification (MRV) system for adaptation have been initiated. Limits, gaps, obstacles, opportunities, lessons learned, good practices and perspectives will also be identified. Ultimately, the NAP will be available in 2022, in addition to the adaptation component of these NDCs.</p>
        <p><strong>BOX 4: ADAPTATION COMPARISON CDN2015 / REVISED CDN</strong></p>
        <p>As part of the revision of Côte d'Ivoire's NDCs, an update of the vulnerable sectors was carried out on the basis of the following four (4) criteria: the ND-GAIN index of the University of Notre Dame (Notre Dame Globale Adaptation Initiative), studies of sectoral vulnerabilities, political priorities and the perceptions of territorial actors on sectoral vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Thus, in the revised NDCs five vulnerable sectors (05) have been identified as priorities for which strengthening resilience is essential:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Agriculture, Livestock and Aquaculture;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Forests and land use;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Water resources;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Health;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Coastal areas.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then, for each of these 5 priority vulnerable sectors, strategic axes and priority actions were declined. Adaptation objectives by sector have been established on the basis of sectoral policies in order to guarantee coherence and a long-term vision. Finally, the synergies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), among others, SDG 2 Fight against hunger, SDG 3 Health and well-being and SDG 5 Gender equality were highlighted.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER 3: IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
              <h3>3.1. NDC GOVERNANCE SYSTEM</h3>
              <p>In Côte d'Ivoire, the implementation of NDCs is placed under the aegis of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development. For the effective operation of an NDC governance arrangement, particular attention should be paid to the following principles:</p>
              <p>The principle of inclusion: all actors involved in the fight against climate change must be involved in the implementation of the NDCs;</p>
              <p>The principle of appropriation: all actors intervening in the fight against climate change must invest more in the implementation of the NDCs;</p>
              <p>The principle of coordination: the roles and responsibilities of all actors intervening in the fight against climate change must be clearly defined.</p>
              <h3>3.2. NDC IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING PLANS</h3>
              <p>The NDC review process includes the development of an investment plan with a resource mobilization strategy. These documents will provide more details on the estimated costs mentioned in the overall budget of Côte d'Ivoire's NDCs. For the implementation of the NDCs, it is also planned to set up a monitoring and evaluation framework. The results of this review process indicate the need to involve actors at three levels in the monitoring of implementation: the political level, the technical level and the administrative level. Also, with the aim of disseminating the achievements in terms of climate change, a communication strategy will be developed. This strategy will allow for better communication with a view to raising awareness,</p>
                  <h4>3.2.1. FUNDING SOURCES AND MECHANISMS</h4>
                  <p>Côte d'Ivoire intends to finance the mitigation and adaptation measures of its revised NDCs through various sources.</p>
                  <p><strong>Endogenous sources</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>National budget: this will involve mobilizing financial resources through the alignment of NDC measures with national development plans as well as the inclusion of these measures in public investment programs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Private finance: the participation of the private sector in the financing of the implementation of the NDCs constitutes an essential element. In particular, it will make it possible to develop innovative financing such as local carbon markets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
                      <p><strong>Exogenous sources</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Climate finance: the development of international climate finance offers real hope for developing countries and Côte d'Ivoire in particular. The increase in the capitalization of climate funds such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Adaptation Fund (AF) as well as disbursements to developing countries constitute an essential expectation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Technical and financial partners: the support of technical and financial partners in achieving the environmental ambitions of Côte d'Ivoire has been decisive since the first environmental assessments that led to the development of the National Action Plan for the Environment (PNAE) of 1994, through the post-conflict environmental assessment of 2015, to the development of Nationally Determined Contributions (CDN) of 2022. The maintenance and strengthening of this support is more than necessary in view of the urgency linked to the achievement of climate objectives in the coming decades.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                      <p>Other economic instruments: Côte d'Ivoire, like other countries, intends to diversify its economic instruments to finance its environmental and climate actions. As such, it recently embarked on a process of preparing and issuing green bonds on sub-regional and international markets.</p>
                  <h4>3.2.2. NDC IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERSHIP PLAN</h4>
                  <p>The partnership plan (annex 3), developed by the country within the framework of the global partnership for the implementation of the NDCs (NDC Partnership), identifies the support partners for the implementation and monitoring of the NDCs. This plan has defined concrete measures and planning for the implementation of said measures around four (4) strategic pillars. This implementation extends over the period of 2022-2030 and will mobilize several actors and implementing partners (Figure 3).</p>

              <h3>3.3. OVERALL NDC BUDGET</h3>
                  <h4>3.3.1. COST ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY</h4>
                    <p>Despite the technical and methodological constraints, it is important to be able to quantify as well as possible the commitments made in the revised NDCs. As such, a first costing which aims to give an order of magnitude of the investments necessary to achieve the commitments made in these NDCs has been carried out. To do this, the costs of priority actions were estimated based on: (i) a review of existing budgeted policy and program documents, (ii) a review of the costs of existing projects and projects under preparation and (iii) consultations stakeholders.</p>
                  <p>For example, the cost of the degradation of coastal areas in Côte d'Ivoire, according to an assessment by the World Bank, would amount to 1.985 million (or 992,500,000,000 FCFA)* dollars per year. While the damage costs of a 20 cm rise in sea level by 2050 in the city of Abidjan alone, assessed under the WACA program, has been estimated at around 460 billion FCFA per year.</p>
                  <p>However, this first cost estimate highlighted a need to strengthen short- and medium-term forecasting elements (horizons 2030 and 2050) and to identify financing needs in priority sectors, in particular for the health sector. which has been little studied. Thus, the investment plan will refine the costs of the actions contained in the NDCs.</p>
                  <h4>3.3.2. OVERALL NDC COST</h4>
                  <p>The overall cost for the implementation of the revised NDCs represents a total budget envelope of approximately twenty-two (22) billion US$. They are distributed as follows:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Ten (10) billion US dollars for the mitigation component, i.e. 5,000 billion FCFA*;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Twelve (12) billion US$ or 6,000 billion FCFA*.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <p>For the NDC update process, anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals were quantified using the IPCC National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Guidelines (2006). A model of GHG sources and sinks was developed for Côte d'Ivoire using the Low-Carbon Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP), which integrated analyzes developed by several consultants for different sectors. In the LEAP model, IPCC (2006) Tier 1 methodologies and default emission factors were used to estimate GHG emissions from all sources. Emissions were estimated from 2010 to 2030, with 2012 being the historical reference year (base year) and 2030 the reference year for GHG reduction target (target year).

                <p>The overall GHG reduction objective of the NDCs is an aggregation of GHG emission reductions resulting from the implementation of actions in five major source sectors, as shown below:</p>
                <p>Energy</p>
                    <p>GHG mitigation in the energy sector was assessed using a model developed using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) tool.</p>
                    <p>In 2012, the Energy sector was estimated to emit 18 million tonnes of C02 equivalent. Based on the projected population and GDP growth described in section l(e), it is estimated that GHG emissions from the energy sector will increase to 40 million tonnes of C02 equivalent emissions in 2030 for the reference scenario.</p>
                    <p>Twenty-four (24) mitigation measures in the energy sector were assessed.</p>
                    <p>In the energy sector, the unconditional goal includes the implementation of 17 mitigation measures, which reduce emissions by 28.55% GHG emissions from the energy sector in 2030 compared to GHG emissions from the energy sector in the reference scenario. The conditional goal includes the implementation of 7 additional mitigation measures. The full implementation of unconditional and conditional targets helps to reduce 37.66% GHG emissions from the energy sector in 2030 compared to the reference scenario.</p>
                <p>Agriculture</p>
                <p>IPCC (2006) Tier 1 approaches were used to estimate emissions from livestock enteric fermentation and manure management, synthetic fertilizer application and methane emissions from rice production.</p>
                <p>In 2012, agriculture was estimated to emit 4 million tonnes of C02 equivalent. Based on projected population and GDP growth, described in section l(e), GHG emissions from the agricultural sector are estimated to increase to 6.8 million tonnes of C02 equivalent emissions in 2030 for the baseline scenario.</p>
                <p>Five (5) mitigation measures in the agriculture sector were assessed. The unconditional objective includes the implementation of two (2) mitigation measures, which make it possible to reduce GHG emissions from the agricultural sector by 14.34% in 2030 compared to GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in the scenario of reference. The conditional objective includes the implementation of three (3) additional mitigation measures. The full implementation of the unconditional and conditional objectives makes it possible to reduce GHG emissions from the agricultural sector by 20% in 2030 compared to the reference scenario.</p>
                <p>Forestry and other land uses</p>
                <p>IPCC (2006) Tier 1 approaches were used to estimate emissions from Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (biomass gains and losses), Forest Converted to Other Land and Land Converted to Forest Land.</p>
                <p>In 2012, TSF emissions were estimated to be 58 million tonnes of C02 equivalent. Based on the continuation of historical trends, the</p>
                <p>GHG emissions for the FAT sector are estimated to increase to 68.6 million tonnes of C02 equivalent emissions in 2030 for the baseline scenario.</p>
                <p>Two mitigation measures in the agricultural sector have been assessed, based on the objectives of the SPREF strategy of Côte d'Ivoire. The unconditional objective includes the implementation of two mitigation measures, to reduce the rate of 70% deforestation and the conversion of 1million hectares of land to forest by 2030, which makes it possible to achieve a 35% reduction in GHG emissions from the FOLU sector in 2030 compared to GHG emissions from the FOLU sector in the base scenario. The conditional target includes the implementation of an additional mitigation measure, the conversion of 2 million hectares additional forest land by 2030. Full implementation of the unconditional and conditional targets will reduce GHG emissions from the agricultural sector by 150% by 2030 compared to the reference scenario.</p>
                <p>Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs)</p>
                <p>The GHG Mitigation Assessment conducted to inform the NDC update also assessed the impact of implementing the 38 mitigation actions achieving the NDC target on Short-Lived Climate Pollutant (SLCP) (black carbon) and air pollutant emissions (PM2.5, NOx, S02, VOCNM, CO, organic carbon).</p>
                <p>Côte d'Ivoire recognizes the 2018 IPCC report on global warming of 1.5 degrees which shows no way to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees without deep reductions in SLCPs like methane and carbon. black carbon, alongside GHGs. Reducing SLCPs and air pollutants, alongside GHGs, can also help ensure that achieving Côte d'Ivoire's NDCs not only contributes to mitigation of global climate change, but also has local benefits for human health in Côte d'Ivoire, through exposure reduced to air pollution.</p>
                <p>It is estimated that achieving Côte d'Ivoire's NDCs will lead to substantial reductions in SLCPs and air pollutants, in addition to GHGs. This will prevent more than 7000 premature deaths due to exposure to fine particles. The expected emission reductions for the different pollutants are presented in the table below:</p>

This target did not include the Forestry sector.</p>
