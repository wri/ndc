  <p> INTRODUCTION </p>

  <p> The Paris Climate Agreement, in its article 6, paragraph 1, encourages countries to act voluntarily in consultation in the implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), at: </p>

  <p> (i) raise the level of ambition of their mitigation and adaptation measures and (ii) promote the sustainable development and environmental integrity. </p>

  <p> The revised NDC of the Republic of Congo is based on its five (05) pillars which relate to: governance, mitigation, adaptation, MRV and financing, was developed following an inclusive process and transparent. </p>

  <p> The main strategic axes taken into account to update the initial NDC of 2015 and enhance the country's ambitions in the fight against climate change relate to: </p>

  <ul>

    <li>

      <p> strengthening political will and buy-in from national stakeholders and development partners; </p>

    </li>

    <li>

      <p> reviewing, aligning and updating the objectives, policies and measures established in the areas of climate and sustainable development; </p>

    </li>

    <li>

      <p> the integration of new sectors and / or greenhouse gases in the revised NDC; </p>

    </li>

    <li>

      <p> evaluation of the costs and investment possibilities of the priority actions selected in the fields of climate and sustainable development; </p>

    </li>

    <li>

      <p> monitoring progress and enhancing transparency. </p>

    </li>

  </ul>

      <h2> I. CONTEXT </h2>

      <p> The Republic of the Congo which covers an area of ​​342,000 km² is located in Central Africa, straddling the equator between Gabon, the Atlantic Ocean, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Angolan enclave of Cabinda. </p>

      <p><img width="548" height="585" alt="C:\Users\user\Desktop\CARTE-1.jpg" src="img/COG-NDC1-1.png"/></p>

      <p> Figure 1: Administrative map of the Republic of Congo </p>

      <p> The Congolese economy is mainly based on the mining and extractive industries (oil and gas) and the primary sector (agriculture, fishing and forestry). The population will go from 3,697,490 inhabitants in 2007 to 6,560,384 inhabitants in 2030. Women, who constitute 50.7% of the population (RGPH, 2007), will still be in the majority in terms of numbers. The population of the Republic of Congo is among the most vulnerable, insofar as it has limited room for adaptation, mainly due to poverty. Maintaining the services provided by natural ecosystems (forests, savannas, hydrological basins, etc.) is essential to ensure future development relays, limit the impacts of climate change and offer possibilities for adaptation to the most vulnerable groups, including are part of women and young people of all socio-cultural categories of urban and rural centers. The economic sectors which serve as the basis of socio-economic development of the Republic of Congo are: energy, transport, industry, mines, agriculture, forestry, water, tourism, trade; human settlements and health, coastal landscape, waste, etc. </p>

      <h2> II. MITIGATION </h2>

      <p> The greenhouse gases taken into account are: </p>

      <ul>

        <li>

          <p> Carbon dioxide (CO2), </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> Methane (CH4), </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> Nitrous oxide (N2O), </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> F gases such as Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), Perfluorinated Hydrocarbons (PFC), Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) </p>

          <p> The GHG emitting sectors taken into account in the revised NDC of the Republic of Congo are: </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> Energy, for emissions from the energy industries, manufacturing and construction industries, transportation, residences, commerce, solid fuels, oil and natural gas; </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use (AFAT) with emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management in animal husbandry, rice cultivation, agricultural soils, burnt savannas and burnt agricultural residues, emissions and removals from forests, etc. ; </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> Industrial processes and product use (PIUP), for emissions from mining industries (cement, lime, glass, etc.), chemical industries (ammonia and other acids), metallurgical industries (iron, steel, lead, aluminum, etc.) and other industrial productions (electrical and electrical equipment, solvent, aerosol, etc.); </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p> Waste with solid and liquid waste emissions. </p>

        </li>

      </ul>

          <p> 2.1- Evolution of emissions in the Republic of Congo </p>

          <p> The Republic of Congo, which aims for emergence in the short term and development in the long term, is still counted in the group of developing countries with low greenhouse gas emissions. The evolution of emissions from 1994 to 2021 is as follows: </p>

      <h2> III. ADAPTATION </h2>

      <p> In accordance with Articles 7.10 and 7.11 of the Paris Agreement, the Republic of Congo has chosen to integrate an adaptation component, which will include its priorities, implementation and support needs, plans and his actions. </p>

      <h4> 3.1- Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities </h4>

      <p> The current NDC aims to accelerate the socio-economic growth of Congo by comprehensively addressing specific vulnerabilities in the sector and by unlocking and directing national and external investments towards adaptation for effective climate action. </p>

      <h4> 3.1.1- Energy Sector </h4>

      <p> a) - Wood energy subsector </p>

      <p> The impacts of climate change on the biomass-energy sub-sector noted by the populations are among others the depletion of wood-energy resources, the remoteness of the wood-energy collection areas, the increase in the price of wood energy. In the future, if nothing is done and considering the impact of climate change according to the RCP6.0 scenario, the global vulnerability index of this sub-sector will increase slightly due to the increasingly high demand. , depletion of resources and its exposure. </p>

      <p> b) - Hydropower sub-sector </p>

      <p> The potential of hydroelectricity is strongly linked to the availability of water resources, especially surface water resources, and their inlet flows at the level of the basins where the dams are installed. However, water resources constitute one of the sectors most exposed to climate change due to their dependence on the climate, in particular the variation of several climatic parameters among which are rainfall, evaporation. and temperature. Analyzes indicate that the hydropower sub-sector is moderately exposed to climatic hazards. The main hazards are the poor distribution of rains and drought. </p>

      <p> c) - Hydrocarbons sub-sector </p>

      <p> The reduction in the energy supply in biomass and hydroelectricity should increase the consumption of hydrocarbons. As the trend of the increase in hydrocarbon consumption may be a foreseeable situation on a large scale (sub-region, continent, etc.), an increasingly important imbalance of supply and demand should lead to an increase in prices. petroleum products on the world market. The marked increase in the consumption of hydrocarbons (gasoline, diesel) in the Congo in response to the energy crisis from 1998 (beginning of the years of extreme droughts), is a situation which justifies the trend of recourse to petroleum products in the event of major hydroelectric power deficit in Congo. </p>

      <h4> 3.1.2- Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use Sector (AFAT) </h4>

          <p> a) Vulnerability and impacts of climate change on the agriculture sub-sector </p>

          <p> Climate change impacts the Congolese agricultural sub-sector to varying degrees depending on the region considered. However, certain climatic factors such as the increase in the extent of the dry spells, the disruption of the seasons, the irregularity of the rains, the decrease in annual precipitation, floods, the increase in temperatures, etc., pose a serious threat to the environment. this sub-sector in Congo. </p>

          <p> b) Vulnerability and impacts of climate change on the forestry and other land use sub-sector </p>

      <p> The following climatic factors pose a serious threat to the forestry sub-sector in the Republic of Congo. These are: the increase in the extent of dry spells, the disruption of the seasons, the shift in the seasons, the irregularity of the rains, the intense drought, the decrease in annual precipitation and the increase in temperatures. </p>

      <h4> 3.1.3- Water Resources Sector </h4>

      <p> The most vulnerable groundwater resources are those of the coastal basin, because they are used to supply drinking water to the agglomeration of Pointe-Noire, which is constantly developing economically with strong population growth. The superficial layer is fed thickly by effective average infiltration and it is very stressed by boreholes and many undeclared traditional wells. </p>

      <p> The increasingly severe low water levels over the past 25 years (because the average value of minimum heights has fallen by 157%), to which is added an aggravation of the phenomenon of silting up, have serious consequences on biodiversity, fishing and navigation with a clear decline in traffic at the port of Brazzaville. </p>

      <h4> 3.1.4- Human establishments and health </h4>

      <p> By 2020, 2050, 2080 and 2100, with the combination of soil modification by paving, thermal activities (power plants, transport, etc.), we can expect an artificial warming in cities of this size. The reduction in green spaces (increase in the albedo effect and the absence of water bodies) also contributes to the modification of the thermal and pluviometric balance. </p>

      <p> Congo's demographic and health indicators highlight the worrying state of the population's health. This state is characterized by high maternal neonatal, infant and child mortality and high morbidity. </p>

      <p> Climate projections as planned will increase these endemic situations with low sanitation capacity and chronic malnutrition. </p>

      <h4> 3.1.5- Coastal zone </h4>

      <p> The relevant hazards identified in the coastal zone of Congo are: coastal erosion, floods and floods, marine submersion, late rains, pockets of drought, sea level rise, strong winds, salinization and degradation of system humidities lagoon. The major element of effect and scale known on the Congolese coast is marine erosion which is distinguished by a decline in the coastline. The rise in sea level is still hardly noticeable. </p>

      <h4> 3.1.6- Tourism </h4>

      <p> In the tourism sector, the increase in temperature could lead to the migration and / or destruction of fauna leading to a decrease in tourist activity (attendance). The variability of the rain would lead to seasonal unavailability and a decrease in tourist activity. </p>

      <h4> 3.2- Type of adaptation objectives </h4>

      <p> To strengthen resilience in the face of the adverse effects of climate change, it is envisaged: </p>

      <ul>

        <li>

          <p> Protection of populations; </p>

      </td>

      <td>

        <p> Congo is very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. There are other effects of climate change that are not yet making headlines, but are equally disrupting rural communities' livelihoods and food systems. Climate change is leading to higher temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns, including an increased incidence of prolonged droughts. This translates into reductions in water availability, variable and shorter growing seasons, and reductions in production potential. In the southern Congo regions (Mindouli, Madingou, Nkayi and Dolisie), the impacts are most severely felt, with the highest levels of interannual variability in rainfall, as well as some of the lowest seasonal rainfall in the country, associated with an increase in temperatures. As a result, rain-dependent livelihoods are compromised and, with limited alternatives to cope, government capacities are strained to help meet recurring food needs. </p>

        <p> Climate projections show that these trends will continue and become more variable in nature5. To meet these challenges, the project is seeking the support of the GCF to: </p>

        <ol>

          <li>

            <p> Reducing vulnerability to climate risks through the promotion of agriculture resilient to climate change, as well as the restoration and improvement of watersheds, for women and men in a situation of food insecurity. </p>

          </li>

          <li>

      </td>

      <td>

        <p> Despite its small population, more than 70% of the Congolese population depends on natural resources for their livelihood. The productivity of these natural resources is threatened by both climatic and non-climatic factors, which increases the vulnerability of rural communities. There is evidence that the deterioration of biodiversity and ecosystem services will lead to increased vulnerability of communities and reduced potential for nature-based livelihoods and economic activities. An increased risk of drought, combined with increased interannual and intra-annual variability, is likely to lead to an increased risk of forest fires, which will contribute to intensifying erosion pressures associated with climate change. The proposed project assumes that biodiversity and ecosystems provide valuable services, especially with regard to provisioning services. The livelihoods of the community are based on the services provided by healthy ecosystems, including economic value through agro-productive use (grazing for livestock and healthy soils for agriculture). This proposed project will use large-scale ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) as a low-risk, cost-effective approach to build climate resilience in the eight major landscapes targeted for implementation. This will lead to a paradigm shift. </p>

        <p> The project has three components, the first of which aims to strengthen the capacities of rural communities dependent on ecosystem goods and services by developing landscape strategies and community-driven coordination mechanisms in eight landscapes. Landscape governance systems through participatory decision-making processes between community groups themselves or neighboring communities will be implemented, while the promotion of knowledge sharing between communities and other stakeholders outside the target landscape will be central to scaling up and replicating activities. The first element is essential for the success and sustainability of the envisaged Community climate adaptation action. </p>

        <p> This project responds to the call for proposals (RfP) issued by the GCF in July 2016, and is designed to meet the stated objectives of the call for tenders, namely: to strengthen country ownership of projects and programs by decentralizing decision-making to the country level, thus allowing greater involvement and contribution of relevant stakeholders. Unlike the traditional direct access modality, there will be no submission of individual projects or programs to the Fund as decision-making for the funding of specific pilot activities will be devolved to the national level. </p>

        <p> The proposed project is designed to strengthen country ownership of adaptation by delegating decision making to national and community level, greater participation of communities vulnerable to climate change. The problem this project seeks to address is that the pilot country suffers loss of property, lives and well-being due to climate variability and climate-induced extremes. Climate change is already leading to an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. </p>

        <p> The Likouala region is a prime example of the urgent need to address the multisectoral challenges of climate change in Congo. The impacts include profound changes in water availability, temperature pressures on people, livestock and crops, changes in public health, agricultural practices, incomes, food security and ecology. Climate models predict a further intensification of dry seasons, but also intense unpredictable rains and floods, which pose a significant threat to livelihoods, especially among the poor. For the population, and women are particularly negatively affected, these developments present increasing challenges to daily life, with insufficient local water supply, deteriorating health conditions and deteriorating opportunities for (subsistence) agriculture posing specific threats. </p>

        <p> The objective of the project is to increase the climate resilience of rural and urban households, in particular small farmers and women, living in the Likouala region and to improve policies and regulations for cross-sectoral action in favor of climate adaptation. It will contribute to the implementation of Congo's Nationally Determined Contributions (CDNs). </p>

        <p> The proposed project, through an integrated approach to ecosystem-based adaptation and climate-resilient agriculture, will result in a national paradigm shift in how the Congo addresses the current and future impacts of threatening climate change the livelihoods of rural Congolese. Land use policies, legislation and planning will be reformed to catalyze the scaling up of climate-resilient management of agricultural land and forests across the Congo. This move upmarket will also be facilitated by a rigorous analysis and dissemination of information on the positive socio-economic and ecological effects of project interventions and by the strengthening of technical capacities within the Congolese government to integrate agricultural and ecological interventions into their adaptation investments. </p>

        <p> Climate change and variability are increasingly damaging the livelihoods of rural farming communities in Congo. Communities in central and northern Congo are particularly threatened by shorter growing seasons, increased days of extreme heat, rising temperatures, more frequent and severe droughts, and more intense rains. These adaptation objectives will be achieved through three interrelated outcomes, namely: (i) improved provision of ecosystem goods and services for adaptation to climate change through forest restoration, (ii) agricultural productivity increased to secure livelihoods in the face of climate change and (iii) capacity building and awareness to implement EbA and climate resilient agriculture. Climate models show that these effects are likely to intensify considerably in the decades to come. Vulnerable Congolese communities are increasingly using natural resources (eg charcoal production) to offset declining agricultural productivity and cope with their growing poverty. This results in unsustainable use of forest resources and a negative vicious cycle in which rapid degradation of ecosystems leads to greater vulnerability of communities to climate change. The objective of the proposed GCF project is to interrupt this cycle in central and northern Congo and to strengthen the climate resilience of local communities by integrating climate-resilient agricultural techniques with tailor-made restoration of degraded forest ecosystems. This ecosystem-based adaptation (AbE) approach will result - under current and future conditions of climate change - in increased agricultural productivity (through sound soil management and the planting of climate-resilient crops) and increased supply of ecosystem goods and services (including water availability, soil conservation and cooling, fibers, medicines, fruits, fuelwood and timber). Forest restoration will focus intensely on the use of native trees well adapted to current and future climatic conditions. </p>

  <h2> CONCLUSION </h2>

  <p> The present CDN of the Republic of Congo, which saw the effective participation of national stakeholders and technical and financial partners, was carried out in a context characterized by the economic crisis (with the drastic drop in the prices of raw materials) and the health crisis (with the COVID 19 pandemic). </p>

  <p> Despite these unprecedented crises, which drastically reduce the country's financial capacities, the Government and other stakeholders are committed to raising the national ambition in terms of reducing emissions. This commitment should in no way compromise the socio-economic development of the country. </p>

  <p> The national stakeholders who commit to implementing the 2021 NDC take to heart the preamble of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which emphasizes that “the measures taken to deal with climate change must be closely coordinated with social and economic development in order to avoid any negative impacts, taking into account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries, namely sustainable economic growth and poverty eradication. They are also aware that Article 2 of the aforementioned convention states the following: “The ultimate objective of this Convention and of any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to stabilize, in accordance with the provisions relevant of the Convention, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic disturbance of the climate system. This level should be reached in sufficient time for ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, for food production not to be threatened and for economic development to continue in a sustainable manner. </p>

  <p> The preamble to the Paris Agreement emphasizes that climate change is a matter of concern for all of humanity. Countries should take into account their respective obligations regarding human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities, in their actions in the face of climate change. and people in vulnerable situations, and the right to development, as well as gender equality, women's empowerment and intergenerational equity. </p>

  <p> It is on these principles that national stakeholders will work to implement the NDC, both in its conditional and unconditional scenarios. </p>
