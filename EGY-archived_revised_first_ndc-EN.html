  <title>EGYPT’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION</title>
<body>
  <h1>Egypt's First Updated Nationally Determined Contributions</h1>
  <h3>8th June 2022</h3>
  <h3>I. NATIONAL CONTEXT</h3>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1994 to be among the first countries to respond to the threats of climate change as per the equity principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in accordance with the respective national capabilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in November 2015 to achieve the global targets set out in the UNFCCC’s Paris Agreement. After Egypt signed the Paris Agreement on the 22nd of April 2016 and ratified it on 29th June 2017, the INDC was considered Egypt’s first NDC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>This document presents an update to Egypt’s first NDC, covering the period between 2015 till 2030. The NDC update is aligned with Egypt’s developmental and climate change policies, including Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt’s Vision 2030, the emerging Long Term Low Emission Development Strategy 2050 (LT-LEDS), the National Climate Change Strategy 2050 (NCCS), National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction 2030<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change. In addition to sectoral strategies, such as: Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy 2035, National Energy Efficiency Action Plan II (2018 – 2022), National Water Resources Plan (2017- 2037), Integrated Solid Waste Management Strategy, and Sustainable Agricultural Development Strategy towards 2030 (SADS 2030).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt submitted its initial, second and third national communications to the UNFCCC in 1999, 2010 and 2016, respectively. Moreover, Egypt’s first Biennial Update Report (BUR) was submitted in 2019 and the fourth national communication is underway and expected to be submitted to the UNFCCC by the end of 2024. These reports presented the cumulative adaptation and mitigation measures and envisaged plans to achieve Egypt’s commitments under the UNFCCC. Since then, Egypt adopted additional range of actions to respond to the climate change challenges as highlighted below.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  <h4>National Circumstances</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt is a developing country, with a fast-growing population of about 102 million as of January 2022. About 95% of the population lives in the Nile Valley and Delta. With an ambitious economic growth outlook, these demographics place considerable stresses on natural resources, employment, infrastructure, education, and healthcare.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Nile River is the main source of fresh water for Egypt supplying 55.5 billion cubic meters (BCM) per year as per the share agreed by international treaties. Additional marginal amounts are provided from deep non-renewable groundwater aquifers (2.1 BCM), limited rainfall (1.3 BCM), and desalination (0.35 BCM) to increase the total yearly available water resources to 59.25 BCM.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The total water needs are estimated at 114 BCM, whereas in order to bridge the gap the country depends on the reuse of the agricultural drainage and treated wastewater equivalent to 21 BCM. Egypt has 97% dependency ratio since its renewable water sources comes from outside its territory, increasing its sensitivity to external influences. With population growth, there has been a sharp decline in the annual freshwater resources available per capita to shrink from 1,972 cubic meters per year in 1970 to 570 cubic meters per year in 2018. It is expected to fall to 390 cubic meters per year by 2050<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, pushing the country closer to the severe water scarcity threshold. Egypt’s water stress levels are at 117%<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>as of 2017 . Climate change impacts, water pollution, and geopolitical factors are expected to exacerbate water stress in Egypt. The climate change scenarios indicate that the Nile inflow at Aswan will decrease as result of the impact throughout the Nile Basin.

        <li>
          <p>Egypt is highly vulnerable to the risks of climate change impacts, where the Nile Delta is considered one of the three extreme vulnerable hotspots mega-deltas directly affected by 2050 according to the IPCC.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Estimates indicate that sea level rise (SLR) may reach about 1.0 m by year 2100 which would sink several coastal areas in the Nile Delta, the Northern Coast, and Sinai. SLR will lead to the sinking of at least 1% of Egypt’s area where most of its residents live in only 5.5% of its total area. Saltwater intrusion from sea-level rise, reduced recharge rates, and higher evaporation rates with increased temperatures will extend areas of salinization of groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability suitable for drinking and irrigation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>More than 30% of the Nile delta is a lowland area (levels lower than +2.00 m) and faces several risks such as erosion and flooding. About three-fifths of Egypt’s food production is secured from agricultural land in the Nile Delta region. Studies anticipate that Egyptian cultivated area will be reduced to about 0.95 million acres (~ 8.2% of the Egyptian cultivated area) by 2030 due to climate change impacts The Delta is expected to lose up to a minimum of 30% of its food production by 2030. Further impact on national food security is expected from the increased frequency of droughts and floods, which consequently lowers productivity of crops and livestock. This will compound the already economically tense and food insecure state of the region.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>As to socio-economic impacts, the decreased water allocated for agriculture purposes, that consumes about 80% from the total water budget, will have a negative impact on the livelihoods of more than 25% of the labor force in Egypt working in agriculture activities. This will have a negative impact on the Delta’s human settlements and agricultural land, particularly the northern areas bordering the Mediterranean coast. The lost land to the sea, flooded human settlements and agriculture lands, labor migration from marginal and coastal areas, would further aggravate the situation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Additional pressures are affecting the coastal zones, particularly the Nile Delta, due to impact of the sea level rise and the recurrence of severe storms and other extreme weather events that have increased significantly in Egypt over the last ten years inducing casualties and economic losses. This would negatively impact ecosystems in coastal cities in the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, and Upper Egypt, land uses, infrastructure, human settlements, economic activities human health, the reliability and operating costs of water and sanitation infrastructure, and the country’s economic activities in general.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt’s ambitious macroeconomic and structural reforms since 2016 has stabilized the economy, thus it entered COVID-19 crisis with sizable buffers. Egypt was one of the few emerging market countries that showed resilience in the face of the pandemic and experienced a positive growth rate in 2020. Still, the adverse repercussions of the pandemic, global economic shocks leading to abrupt increase in food and fuel prices, and other geo-political tensions have undermined this recent progress and threatened the country’s ability to access funds to meet its needs. The real growth has declined from 5.6% in FY2018/19 to 3.3% during FY 2020/21.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Some sectors continue to severely suffer (such as tourism, manufacturing, and oil and gas extractives) due to imposed restrictions on international travel, decline in demand, and disruptions in supply chains and trade. Moreover, Egypt’s foreign debt is ballooning with an alarming $8 billion increase in just three months and increase to $145.5 billion by the end of December 2021.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Egypt’s balance of payments hit $325 million deficit in second quarter of FY2021/22. The increase in foreign debt is expected to consume almost 45 per cent of total revenues in the new FY2022/23 budget. It has prompted the Central Bank of Egypt in March 2022 to depreciate the exchange rate overnight by around 16% to stem the widening net exports deficit. These soaring inflationary pressures necessitates that the Government further intensifies its poverty reduction efforts. Consequently, all these factors limit Egypt’s ambition on allocating future climate investments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt’s vision by 2030 is to achieve a competitive, balanced, diversified, and knowledge- based economy, characterized by justice, social integration and participation, with a balanced and diversified ecosystem, benefiting from its strategic location and human capital to achieve sustainable development for a better life of all Egyptians. Climate change efforts falls within Egypt’s path toward sustainable and inclusive development that eradicates poverty and strives to achieve prosperity for future generations. It shall leverage on Egypt’s recent success on attaining pro-poor economic growth with the decline in poverty since 2020 for the first time in almost two decades and strengthening social safety nets to reach the most vulnerable. The key sustainability enablers to accelerate the way forward to horizon 2030 are data availability, financing, digital transformation, technology and innovation, legislative environment, supportive cultural values, and population growth management.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In 2021, development partners provided $10.27 billion as support to Egypt in accelerating the achievement of its SDG vision.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The collaboration with the international community is pivotal to realize a green and low carbon future.
          </p>
          </li>
        <li>
          <p>This NDC update is Egypt’s pledge for climate change action up to 2030 anchored and dependent on international financial support, ensuring just transition, and appropriateness to national capabilities.</p>

      <h3>III. ACTIONS TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT FIRST NDC SINCE 2015</h3>
      <p>Egypt faced multitude of development challenges that were further exacerbated by the negative impacts of climate change and the accompanying stress on the national budget, as well as the need to address the economic impacts of the COVID pandemic. Nevertheless, Egypt was still able to embark on a broad range of climate policies and projects as detailed in this document. Thus, it reflects Egypt’s ambitious contribution to the global efforts, despite of the country’s negligible responsibility for the world’s historical GHG emissions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Energy Policy Reforms:</strong> The Government launched a comprehensive energy policy reform programme that included energy subsidy phase-out and comprehensive reforms for electricity and oil & gas sectors that were initiated in July 2014 and expected to be completed in FY2024/25. Prior to this programme, energy subsidies constituted 22% of total government expenditure and 6% of the country’s GDP in 2012/13.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Between 2014 and FY2017/18, energy subsidies dropped by nearly half to 3.4 percent of Egypt’s total GDP and comprised of only 0.3 percent of total GDP in FY2019/2020.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The energy policy reforms included substantial renewable energy and energy efficiency programs reflected in the Integrated Energy Strategy 2035.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Investments in renewable energy were encouraged by the Government of Egypt through multiple policy measures regulated under Renewable Energy Law (Decree No 203/2014) and other supporting legislations. The total installed wind and solar power plants in FY2019/20 are 3,016 MW which is 340% increase from FY2015/16 (887 MW). The total renewable energy (including hydropower) in FY2019/20 is 5,848 MW.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The most prominent renewable energy accomplishments in power sector were the launch of Benban Solar Park (total of 1,465 MW), Assuit hydropower plant (32 MW), Kom Ombo Solar PV Plant (26 MW), and Gabal El-Zeit Wind Power Plant (580 MW).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Energy Efficiency in Electricity Sector:</strong> As part of a national plan to improve energy efficiency in the electricity sector, a set of measures have been implemented on both the supply and the demand sides. Due to the extensive power station maintenance, upgrade, and replacement programs on the supply side, a significant drop in the generation fuel consumption rate has been achieved in FY2019/20. The improvement in electricity generation efficiency when coupled with the electricity generated from renewable sources have led to a substantial decline in fuel consumption for electricity generation in two years from 2017/2018 to 2019/2020.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Energy Efficiency and Low Carbon Fuels in Petroleum Sector:</strong> The petroleum sector in parallel launched in 2016 Egypt’s Oil and Gas Sector Modernization Project where under its Program 4B “improving the energy efficiency within the sector” was implemented. Thirty-one companies succeeded in applying no/low-cost energy efficiency measures. In addition, the project provided capacity building trainings to over 900 of sector employees in the domain of energy efficiency. Furthermore, to support the promotion of cars operating on low carbon fuels, there has been rapid spread of natural gas car stations that quadrupled in number during the last 18 months to reach more than 850 stations serving natural gas cars nationwide serving 450,000 cars. On a strategic level, the sector’s energy efficiency policies are defined through the Petroleum Higher Energy Efficiency Committee and cascaded to the energy efficiency departments that are established throughout the petroleum sector.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Energy Efficiency on Demand Side:</strong> Numerous energy efficiency programs are implemented including Improving the Energy Efficiency of Lighting and Building Appliances (2010 – 2017), Industrial Energy Efficiency (IEE) Project (2013 – 2018), Solar Heating in Industrial Processes (SHIP) (2014 – 2022), Motor Efficiency Improvement (Phase I: 2015 – 2018, Phase II: 2018 – 2022), and Egyptian Pollution Abatement Project Phase III (2017- 2022). This has been supported by the issuance of Electricity Law 87/2015 with specific articles for electricity efficiency and energy management and the Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP II) (2018/2019 – 2021/2022). Due to the above mentioned programs and measures by electricity consumers, this has led to reduction in electricity consumption in FY2019/20 compared to FY2018/19 despite a growing population and large development initiatives. Energy efficiency improvement measures include market transformation to energy efficient lighting that showed significant drop in electricity consumption that reached 40% in some buildings as well as improved energy efficiency in industrial sector through energy management systems and simple energy optimization measures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Low Carbon Transport:</strong> The further expansion in the Greater Cairo underground metro network included the operation of stage 4 of length 11.5 km (Phase I: 2019, Phase II: 2020) of the third Cairo metro line as a progress towards achieving the modal shift to low carbon mass transit.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The third line is the first metro to link east and west Cairo and is expected to serve 2 million passenger trips per day.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The concept of high quality service buses has been introduced to Egypt targeting car owners to use the newly public transportation system that is integrated with the existing mass transit systems. It is offered by the private sector and is expanding rapidly with more than 200 smart buses linked to mobile applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Solid Waste Management:</strong> Policy reforms took place with the issuance of Waste Management Regulation Law 202/2020 and its Executive Regulations, Prime Minister Decree 41/2019 on waste-to-energy feed in tariff (October 2019), and Ministerial Decree 49/2021 for mandatory partial replacement of alternative fuels in cement sector (March 2021). In addition to investments in establishing the solid waste management infrastructure in the four pilot governorates (Kafr El-Sheikh – Assuit – Qena – Al Gharbiya) under the Egyptian National Solid Waste Management Programme. In Greater Cairo, the Air Pollution Management and Climate Change Project (2020 – 2026) focuses on reducing vehicle emissions, improving the management of solid waste, and strengthening the air and climate decision-making system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Green Finance:</strong> Mobilizing national and international green finance through multiple mechanisms and initiatives. The launch of the first Sovereign Green Bonds (September 2020) in Middle East and North Africa region by Egypt’s Ministry of Finance at a value of 750 million listed in London Stock Exchange to attract foreign investors. Egypt’s portfolio of eligible green projects is worth $1.9 billion, 16% in renewable energy, 19% in clean transportation, 26% in sustainable water and wastewater management, and 39% in pollution reduction and control.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Environmental Sustainability Criteria Guideline has enabled the increase of green investments from 15% in FY2019/20 to 30% in FY 2020/21, with projections to reach 50% in FY2024/25. This is complemented by Financial Regulatory Authority Decree 107 and 108 in 2021 that mandates companies listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange and companies operating in the non-banking sector to submit environmental, social and governance disclosure reports related to sustainability (ESG standards) and to the financial impacts of climate change.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Furthermore, availing attractive green finance through public and private financial institutions, notably the Green Economy Financing Facility (GEFF).

      <h3>VI. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
      <h4>Policy Mechanisms and Institutional Arrangements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The National Climate Change Council (NCCC) was founded in 2015 through the Prime Minister Decree No.1912 (later amended by the Prime Minister Decree No. 1129/2019) as the national authority in Egypt concerned with climate change. The members of its Supreme Committee are represented across the relevant line ministries headed by the Egyptian Prime Minister.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Ministry of Environment (MoE) was established in 1997 by Presidential Decree no. 275/1997 and its policies are executed by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA). The Climate Change Central Department (CCCD) in the EEAA is the technical secretariat to the NCCC and focal point to the UNFCCC and coordinates climate efforts with relevant ministries and governmental entities. Furthermore, the planning and implementation of climate measures follows participatory approaches through collaboration among government, private sector, civil society, academia, media, international community and other concerned stakeholders.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
          <h4>International Agreements</h4>
          <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt adopts a coherent approach in addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and land and ecosystem degradation. Egypt is a party to the three Rio Conventions (UNFCCC, CBD, and UNCCD), and recognizes the interconnectivity between them particularly with regards to adaptation and resilience, in addition to Montreal Protocol and chemicals conventions, among other multilateral international agreements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
          <h4>Capacity Building and Technology Transfer</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Building a strong foundation for the planning, implementation, and reporting of national climate actions requires adequate institutional, technical, and financial arrangements. In this context, several gaps should be addressed through capacity building and technology transfer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt has a strong climate institutional set-up is in place, but it is constrained by the limited resources and incomplete supporting legal architecture. The CCCD requires substantial financial and human resources to achieve its mandate, cooperate effectively with national partners, implement capacity building programs, and establish robust information systems to address the challenges of climate change.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The national climate reporting relies mainly on donor-funded projects and contracting consultants on an ad-hoc basis to prepare the reports required under the UNFCCC. To sustain these efforts and scale up the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures across Egypt, the proposed MRV system should be institutionalized (refer to Section VII). The relevant ministries should establish climate change unit and/or assign employees to be responsible for climate data collection. Moreover, CAPMAS, the national statistical agency, to expand its environmental unit to include a Climate Change GHG Unit to aggregate climate data from the ministries in coordination with CCCD. A technical support working group could be formed from consultants and experts to provide support to CCCD, CAPMAS and ministerial units and design the data collection forms. For capacity building requirements, data management training (collection, analysis, archiving, and QA/QC) is required for the full-time employees within CCCD, CAPMAS, and ministerial units. The additional requirements include the legal instrument to mandate CAPMAS to report climate data to CCCD.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Technology, research and development, and innovation play an important role in pursuing ambitious climate actions. Egypt’s ability to implement climate action is highly constrained by the availability of appropriate technologies. Support is required to deploy climate-friendly technologies (such as energy storage), build administrative capacities, and supportive legal frameworks. Climate know-how should be freely- available as a global public good to collectively fast-track the transition towards the 1.5-degree target of Paris Agreement. Furthermore, secure and diversify the supply of critical components and raw materials required for climate technologies (such as renewable energy), which are currently concentrated in few countries.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Increase investments in climate projects through the creation of innovative operational models within the local context for partnership between government, private sector (i.e. manufacturers, tech companies, suppliers), development organizations financial institutions, NGOs, and research and educational institutions. Encourage youth to participate in the green transition through skills training, research and innovation, and incentives. Furthermore, facilitate access to business incubators and accelerators to support green entrepreneurship and link to creative financial instruments.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
          <h4>Financial Support</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The financial resources required to implement the updated NDC up to 2030 is estimated at minimum USD 246 billion. The mitigation interventions require USD 196 billion and the adaptation interventions require USD 50 billion. The financial estimates are derived from the required upfront capital expenditures to implement mitigation and adaptation programmes, capacity building and technology transfer, and the human resources needed to implement the actions. The actual implementation of these mitigation and adaptation measures are conditional on the provision of adequate, appropriate international finance through highly concessional finance and grants as appropriate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Egypt is committed to meet the sustainable development goals under its Vision 2030 and the government has already mobilized significant investments from its local public and private resources. However, the Egyptian national efforts alone will not be sufficient to fulfill the country’s aspirations described in this updated NDC to contribute to the international climate change GHGs reduction targets. Therefore, Article 9 of the Paris Agreement, which states that developed parties shall provide support to developing countries, should be enacted. The required finance could be disbursed through international and regional development partners, funds, and investors in multiple types of financial modalities and channels, such as blended finance, green bonds, and grants.</p>

      <h3>VII. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems are the foundation for enhanced national and international action on climate change. Egypt has drafted a proposed national climate MRV structure after engagement of representatives from all concerned national entities. The proposed MRV structure would consist of a supervisory body, represented by the NCCC. The CCCD would be the national coordinating entity with relevant ministries and other governmental agencies. The MRV pathways for data flow consist of four tracks: i) GHG Inventory MRV, ii) Mitigation Policies and Actions MRV, iii) Support Received MRV, and iv) Adaptation Policies and Actions MRV.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The proposed MRV framework has been formally adopted by the NCCC, but has not yet been institutionalized. The kick-off for the national MRV is pending funding and other resources (refer to Section VI, Capacity Building and Technology Transfer), which once available would support the national institutions to mobilize for structuring and implementation. Partial MRV activities exist and would be a solid foundation to evolve into a comprehensive national MRV system.</p>

          <p>Egypt adopts the equity principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in accordance with the respective national capabilities, in accordance with the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement. Despite that Egypt’s contribution to global emissions is marginal, but the country is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts (specifically Delta region) that threaten its path to sustainable development. Egypt has set an ambitious target to contribute to reducing GHG emissions. Egypt update of its NDC is ambitious in terms of meeting the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement including mitigation and adaptation. Leveraging this ambition is directly proportional to the availability of additional sustainable and predictable support to facilitate the means for implementation.</p>
