  <h1>European Union's NDC</h1>
  <h2>SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES</h2>
  <p>Madrid, 16 October 2023</p>
  <h2>Subject: The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and its Member States</h2>
  <p>This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC.</p>
      <h2>I. OVERVIEW</h2>
      <h2>Summary of procedural developments</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) on <strong>6 March 2015</strong>, together with an annex containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in <strong>October 2016,</strong> with a target of <strong>at least 40% economy-wide reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In <strong>December 2019</strong>, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving <strong>a climate-neutral EU by 2050</strong>, in line with the Paris Agreement. On <strong>5 March 2020</strong>, the Council of the European Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the EU and its Member States, reflecting this <strong>climate neutrality objective</strong> and submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the <strong>11 December 2020</strong> the European Council endorsed a new and more ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member States of <strong>“a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990”</strong> and submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat as an <strong>updated and enhanced NDC</strong> on <strong>18 December 2020<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <strong>30 June 2021</strong>, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving climate neutrality, known as the <strong>European Climate Law</strong><strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></strong>. The European Climate Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <strong>14 July 2021</strong>, the European Commission adopted the <strong>“Fit for 55”</strong> set of proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally adopted all the essential elements of the <strong>legislative framework</strong> necessary to implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation<strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></strong> has been published in the official Journal of the European Union.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed in light of the adoption of the <strong>“Fit for 55” legislative framework</strong> and the respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the ICTU).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 1990 by 2030.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.</p>
          <p>The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this document (ICTU).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the <strong>EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)</strong>, the <strong>Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR)</strong>, and the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (<strong>LULUCF</strong>). Additional legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <strong>EU ETS</strong>, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a <strong>new target to reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The extension of the <strong>EU ETS to maritime emissions</strong> will cover CO2, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to <strong>50% of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU</strong>, and all emissions from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With regard to <strong>commercial aviation</strong>, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate <strong>carbon pricing framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional sectors</strong> (<strong>ETS2</strong>) and is designed to price emissions from 2027<strong><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></strong> without free allocation and to contribute to <strong>42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005</strong> in the sectors covered.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Under the revised <strong>Effort Sharing Regulation</strong>, the EU legislation sets enhanced individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level <strong>greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the <strong>LULUCF</strong> sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in the Union.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ambitious <strong>targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing renewables</strong> in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy savings through an enhanced target to <strong>reduce final energy consumption at EU level by 11.7% in 2030</strong> and a new target for <strong>increasing renewable energy in final energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030</strong>, with an additional 2.5% indicative top up that would allow to reach 45%.</p>
          <p>Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A regulation on the deployment of <strong>alternative fuels infrastructure</strong> to ensure that the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an overall climate target of <strong>30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments</strong> with a view to comply with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development pathway.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a <strong>Social Climate Fund to support vulnerable households</strong>, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the articles set out in its Regulation<strong><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The EU ETS revision also strengthens the <strong>EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member States, as of 2024</strong>. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, promoting a <strong>just transition</strong> in carbon dependent regions. The Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the Modernisation fund.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In addition, the <strong>EU ETS’s Innovation Fund</strong> is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A <strong>carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)</strong> will put a price on the carbon content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper international cooperation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate change.</p>

  <p>The EU NDC is prepared in the context of the EU’s commitment to gender equality and cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development<strong><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></strong>; integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality byMember States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate Governance Regulation<strong><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></strong>, the European Pact on Gender Equality<strong><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></strong>; the EU’s support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples<strong><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></strong>. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision- making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights Council and General Assembly that the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a human right and will actively engage in discussions advancing this right and promote inclusion and non- discrimination. The EU recognises the contribution of environmental human rights defenders, who are facing unprecedented levels of threats and attacks.</p>
      <p>All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris Agreement.</p>
      <p>The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development pathway</p>

      <p>(a) How the Party considers that its nationally determine contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its nationalcircumstances;</p>
</td>
  <td>
      <p>The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity across Member States with diverse national circumstances.</p>
      <p>The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost- effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date.</p>
      <p>The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.</p>
      <p>The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period.</p>
      <p>In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed by the revenue of allowances from the ETS.</p>
      <p>The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower- income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.</p>

      <p>(b) Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity;</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990.</p>
      <p>The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that time.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced those of any other major developed or developing economy.</p>
      <p>On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies.</p>
      <p>The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing policies.</p>
