  <p>Foreword</p>
  <p>Ghana believes that if no rapid action is taken to address climate change and its negative impacts now, the future cost will be prohibitive and counterproductive to the socio-economic gains made today. Therefore, responding to climate change issues is top on the national development agenda. That is why Ghana committed to implementing thirty-one mitigation and adaptation actions across seven economic sectors in its nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015.</p>
  <p>In line with Article 4 of the Paris Agreement and UNFCCC decisions 1/CP.21 and 4/CMA.1, Ghana has updated its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement from 2020 to 2030, considering its unique circumstances. The update affirms the country's resolve to address the impacts of climate change on the country's economy and its vulnerable people.</p>
  <p>The update covers 19 policy areas and translates into 47 adaptation and mitigation programmes of action. The 47 climate actions are expected to build the resilience of over 38 million people, generate absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions of 64 MtCO2e, create over one million jobs, avoid 2,900 deaths due to improved air quality by 2030.</p>
  <p>The update of the nationally determined contribution was based on extensive stakeholder consultations with relevant institutions at both national and sub-national levels, with the involvement of Ministries, Departments and Agencies, Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies, development partners, private sector, academia and Civil Society Organisations. The Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation will work with relevant sector institutions and stakeholders to implement the nationally determined contribution to accelerate our development efforts and enhance the well-being of our people.</p>
  <p>It is my cherished hope that the Updated Nationally Determined Contribution will serve as a blueprint for transitioning into a climate-resilient low carbon economy that will accelerate our development efforts and enhance the well-being of our people without sacrificing the quality of the environment and its resources.</p>

Ghana further acknowledges the contribution of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Supporting National Action and Planning on SLCP mitigation (SNAP) initiative and the Stockholm Environment Institute Centre at the University of York for their support regarding the inclusion of Short-Lived Climate Pollutants and air pollution benefits within the revised Nationally Determined Contribution.</p>
      <p><a>1. Introduction</a></p>
      <p>Ghana is pleased to announce its updated and enhanced nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement for 2020 to 2030, per Article 4 of the Paris Agreement and UNFCCC decisions 1/CP.21 and 4/CMA.1. By this communication, and consistent with UNFCCC decision 1/CP. 21, paragraph 24, Ghana affirms the nationally determined contribution it put forward in 2015. There is an urgent need for collective, ambitious and meaningful global efforts to keep the global temperature well below two degrees and avoid the irreversible consequences on the climate-vulnerable countries. Ghana is a member of the Africa Union (AU) and holds in high esteem the geopolitical position of Africa in pursuing the agenda 2063.</p>
      <p>In updating the nationally determined contribution, Ghana was mindful of the need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>embrace the AU and align to new policy changes to safeguard the development prospects of the country;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>enhance implementation of climate actions by strengthening the mobilisation of public, private and grassroots participation; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>increasing the investment credentials and ambition across mitigation, finance and adaptation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>put Ghana's development on an accelerated path for achieving" <i>a resilient and low carbon society by promoting economic growth, climate protection and air quality benefits, youth and women empowerment and social inclusion in the next decade and beyond</i>".</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
          <p>To this end, the revised and enhanced nationally determined contribution reflect aspirations of goal 1, paragraphs 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the AU's agenda 2063.</p>
      <p><a>2. Ghana's Updated Nationally Determined Contribution</a></p>
      <p>The national development strategy to build a resilient society that can adequately withstand the impacts of climate change and contribute to mitigating global emissions is well on course. As part of the national strategy, Ghana has developed 19 policy actions in 10 priority areas to achieve nationally determined contribution goals in the next decade. The 19 policy actions translate into 13 adaptation and 34 mitigation programmes of action (referred to as measures). The 19 policy actions that have the potential to maximise the synergies between adaptation and economic diversification, resulting in mitigation co-benefits, will lead to the following outcomes in the long term:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Accelerate sustainable energy transition</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Build resilient economies and societies</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Enhance early warning and disaster risk management</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Enhance landscape restoration</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure responsible production and consumption</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Foster social inclusion focusing on youth and women</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Provide smart and safe communities</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
          <p>Ghana expects that implementing the 19 policy actions will achieve the following by 2030:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Generate absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions of 64 MtCO2e.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Avoid at least 2,900 premature deaths per year from improved air quality.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Create over one million<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> decent and green jobs and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Benefit cumulatively nearly 38 million people, with the majority being the youth and women.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The 13 adaptation measures are divided into seven unconditional<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and six conditional<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> programmes of action. For the 34 mitigation measures, Ghana aims to implement nine unconditional programmes of action that would result in 8.5 MtCO2e GHG reductions by 2025 and a further 24.6 MtCO2e by 2030 compared to the 2020-2030 cumulative emissions in a baseline scenario. Ghana can also adopt additional 25 conditional programmes of action that have the potential to achieve 16.7 MtCO2e by 2025 and 39.4 MtCO2e by 2030 if financial support from the international and private sector is made available to cover the full cost for implementation.</p>
      <p><a>3. Nationally Determined Contribution and National Development</a></p>
      <p>Ghana anticipates that the updated nationally determined contribution will play a key role in achieving the long-term national development objectives for the country and the global sustainable development goals. That is why this updated nationally determined contribution document strongly aligns with the various national and sector policies and is backed by concrete programmes that the Ministries Department and Agencies (MDA), Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs), private sector, and civil society organisations can implement. The updated and enhanced nationally determined contribution responds to the sustainability priorities in the following national policy documents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Ghana @ 100 frameworks and the accompanying national Infrastructure plan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>2022 to 2025 Medium-Term Development Policy Framework.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ghana Beyond Aid Charter Strategy Document.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>COVID-19 Alleviation and Revitalisation of Enterprises Support</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><a>4. Making the Nationally Determined Contribution Work</a></p>
      <p>Removing the systematic institutional, policy, and financial barriers is the surest way to make the nationally determined contribution work and positively affect the lives of the vulnerable.</p>
      <p>It means that the updated nationally determined contribution must fully respond to government policy needs; be coordinated by capable national institutions, and have access to adequate finance and technology from the international and private sectors.</p>
            <p><a>4.1 Institutional Support for Ghana's Nationally Determined Contribution</a></p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) coordinates the updated nationally determined contribution process and advocates resource allocation at the Cabinet and parliamentary levels. MESTI will also facilitate the future periodic updates of the nationally determined contribution, considering inputs from the global stocktake and the latest scientific evidence. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will track and report the progress of implementing the nationally determined contribution across the nation and regularly publish progress, achievements, and challenges in the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) consistent with the UNFCCC Decision 18/CMA.1 on Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines for the Transparency Framework. To this end:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The EPA and MESTI will advocate adopting appropriate carbon pricing measures, including the operationalisation of Article 6 and other international carbon market instruments to support green businesses, create jobs and facilitate technology transfer.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will continue to mobilise and track inflows from the Government, development partners, and the private sector to implement nationally determined contributions.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) will continue to facilitate the mainstreaming of the nationally determined contribution into the sector and district plans and annual progress report to monitor the nationally determined contribution.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><a>4.3 Financial Needs for Implementing the Revised Nationally Determined Contribution</a> Ghana requires between US$ 9.3 and US$ 15.5 billion<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> of investment to implement the 47 nationally determined contribution measures from 2020 to 2030. US$ 3.9 billion would be required to implement the 16 unconditional programmes of action till 2030. The remaining US$ 5.4 billion for the 31 conditional programmes of action would be mobilised from the public, international, and private sector sources and carbon markets. Ghana will need an additional US$ 3 million biennially to support coordination actions and the regular international reporting of the nationally determined contribution.</p>
            <p><a>4.4 Technology and Capacity Needs for the Revised Nationally Determined Contribution</a> Technology and know-how are a catalyst for implementing the 47 measures to deliver the nationally determined contribution. Ghana will continue to promote rapid technology deployment and support the transfer of suitable emerging technologies to meet the country's needs.</p>
      <p>Ghana also plans to integrate capacity development into the overall implementation plan for the nationally determined contribution. Emphasis will be on continuous staff training, deliberate involvement of academic institutions in the training programme, research and evidence gathering to inform the regular update of nationally determined contribution and participation in the global stocktake. Furthermore, Ghana hopes to strengthen the involvement of civil society organisations and traditional authorities to mobilise public support and ensure the flow of information from the national to the community levels and vice versa.</p>
      <p><a>5. National Arrangement for Tracking Nationally Determined Contribution</a> Article 13 of the Paris Agreement provides the transparency framework for reporting progress and achievement of the nationally determined contribution, the national greenhouse inventory and climate support. Ghana aims to operationalise its integrated climate data and carbon registry platform for managing and reporting transactions involving Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under the cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement consistent with UNFCCC Decision 18/CMA.1 paragraph 77 (d).</p>
      <p>Ghana will use the established structures for the Climate Ambitious Report Programme (CARP) and Annual Progress Report (APR) as the National Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) backbone to regularly track and report progress and achievement of all the 47 measures. Information from the APR (managed by the National Development Planning Commission), climate data and carbon registry system (hosted by the Environmental Protection Agency) and the CLIMFINTRAC, (managed by the Ministry of Finance) for tracking climate finance will feed into the annual nationally determined contribution progress report for the Ghana Government and the international reports such as National Communication, National Adaptation Communication, Biennial Transparency Report and National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Document.</p>

              <p>Ghana, located in West Africa, has a total land area of 239,460 km2. Ghana is a democratic nation with power shared among the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. Ghana's climate is tropical and strongly influenced by the West Africa monsoon winds. The climate is generally warm, with variable temperatures masked by seasons and topography. The northern part of the country typically records one rainy season, which begins in May and lasts until September. Southern Ghana records two rainy seasons from April to July and from September to November. The different rainfall patterns present different climate change vulnerabilities to the northern and southern divides of the country.</p>
              <p>Ghana's 2020 population is estimated at 30.9 million and represents a 26% increase over 2010 levels of 24.6 million at an annual growth rate of 2.3%. Under a tenth (8.2%) of the population live in extreme poverty, outstandingly high in rural Savannah at 36.1%. Poverty and livelihoods, gender and geographic locations determine the level of climate change vulnerabilities in the country.</p>
              <p>In the last 30 years, the economy expanded more than four times, consequently halving poverty to 23% by 2016 <a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. Ghana's sustained economic growth has been influenced by the inflows of proceeds from commodity exports (gold, cocoa, timber, and recently crude oil). In 2019, out of US$22 billion international trade value, gold accounted for 50%, followed by crude oil (22%), cocoa (11%) and other merchantable (17%)9. On the other hand, the cost of environmental degradation was valued at approximately US$ 6.3 billion (World Bank, 2020). Much of the rural livelihoods depend on a natural resource base. Statistics show that 71% of rural people are employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing (World Bank, 2020).</p>
              <p>The devastating effects of COVID-19 made the economy grow by only 1.1% in 2020, a 6.5% shortfall before the pandemic. Besides COVID-19, Ghana is saddled with development challenges associated with high employment, urbanisation, and illegal mining. Climate change presents an additional long- term development risk that Ghana is addressing in the tight fiscal constraints. Despite the economic challenges, climate change remains a priority in Ghana. That is why its recent national development policy outlines climate change as a priority area for action. The commitment to tackle climate on all fronts has been shown in this nationally determined contribution's high ambition climate actions.</p>

The associated emissions/removals from natural disturbances due to forest fires would be included in the national greenhouse inventory estimates consistent with IPCC 2006 guidelines and any subsequent version or refinement, as applicable, as well as Annex II to Decision 4/CMA1.

Tier 1 methodology was used to estimate greenhouse emissions for all the activities in the Energy and Agriculture sectors.</p>
              <p>For the IPPU sector, the tier 1 approach was applied to estimate emissions for all the categories except the metal industry, where tier 2 methodology was used to estimate emissions from aluminium production in the Volta Aluminium Company (VALCO). In the Waste sector, tier 2 was used to estimate emissions from the solid waste disposal category, while tier 1 was applied to the rest of the categories. In the LULUCF sector, tier 3 methodology was used to estimate the net greenhouse gas emissions from the forestland, cropland, and grassland. Tier 2 was used for wetlands, settlements, and other lands. In the LULUCF sector, all areas are considered as part of managed lands.</p>
