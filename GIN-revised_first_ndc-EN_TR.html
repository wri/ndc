                  <h2> <a> a. International context </a> </h2>
                  <p> The Republic of Guinea ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol respectively in 1993 and 2005. It has since developed strategies to combat climate change , including its Initial National Communication (CNI), based on a greenhouse gas inventory (IGES) in 2001 (based on 1994 emissions), its Second National Communication (SCN) (based on 2000 emissions). Finally, the Republic of Guinea drew up its National Action Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA) in 2007 and initiated several projects to implement this plan.
                  <p> Five years after its adoption in Paris at the COP21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Paris Agreement (PA) on climate became effective in 2020. While science regularly demonstrates the scale of the efforts to be made at the global level to respect the collective commitment, the Republic of Guinea, after having ratified the Paris Agreement on April 22, 2016, intends to reaffirm and strengthen its commitment to contribute to the global response against the threat of climate change through the revision of its NDC submitted in 2015. </p>

                  <p> With an area of ​​245,857 km², the Republic of Guinea has a population of approximately twelve million inhabitants, or a density of 48 inhabitants per km². It is characterized by four major eco-climatic zones: Lower Guinea, Middle Guinea, Upper Guinea and Forest Guinea. Its hydrographic network is very dense, 1,166 watercourses divided into 23 watersheds, 14 of which are international. It enjoys a humid tropical climate characterized by the alternation of two seasons of unequal lengths: the dry season during which the harmattan blows and the rainy season governed by the West African monsoon. The rainy season lasts 5 to 7 months (April-October) from north to south; there is a national average of 1988 mm of precipitation per year,
                  <p> With one of the lowest HDIs in the world (178th rank among 189 countries <a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"> <sup> 8 </sup> </a>), the Republic of Guinea must face two major challenges: lifting its population out of poverty and ensuring the country's food security, while its demographic growth is 2.7% per year (INS 2019) and the number of inhabitants is expected to reach 16 million by 2030 (RGPH 2014). </p>

                  <p> Despite the double health crisis of 2020 (Ebola and Covid-19), Guinea experienced economic growth of 7% in 2020, according to recent IMF data, driven by the results obtained by the mining sector during the year with a strong global increase in demand for bauxite. Despite the continuous increase in mining exports in 2020 - as in the last five years with a fourfold increase in the tonnages exported for bauxite - revenues from the mining sector, which represent more than a third of public revenue <a href = "# fn10" class = "footnoteRef" id = "fnref10"> <sup> 10 </sup> </a>, have not increased, due to falling bauxite prices. Note, however, that growth forecasts for 2021 are less optimistic (5.2%) due to the repercussions of the health crisis on other sectors of the Guinean economy. Real growth should continue to be strong over the next few years (estimated growth in 2022 of 6.1% <a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>), supported by a robust and continued expansion of the mining sector, if not faster than expected, and consolidated by a gradual recovery of the non-mining economy. </p>
                  <p> Given these ambitions and the demographic growth, the energy needs of the Republic of Guinea will double in the space of 20 years. However, as the Guinea Vision 2040 prospective document underlines, "<i> this destiny must be accomplished while respecting a protected environment that secures the future of future generations </i>". The CDN's GHG emission reduction commitments are therefore a reflection of national sectoral strategies and plans already adopted at the national level (<i> Paris Agreement, Art.4.4 </i>), but which require urgent mobilization. massive resources for rapid implementation and lasting results. </p>

                  <p> The CDN preparation process started in November 2019 with the support of UNDP through a workshop largely involving the Ministries, Civil Society and Technical and Financial Partners who validated the principle of a revision process . Under the leadership of the National Directorate of Pollution, Nuisance and Climate Change (DNPNCC) within the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Forests (MEEF) and with the support of the UNDP Climate Promise, the project started in first half of 2020 with on the one hand the realization of an inventory of the implementation of the commitments of the CDN of 2015 with the financial support of the African Development Bank, and on the other hand the mobilization of a team of experts for the revision of the CDN officially launched in July 2020 to comply with the provisions of Decision 1 / CP.21 §24. The health context of Covid-19 strongly constrained the authorities involved with a large part of the workshops and preparatory meetings organized by videoconference.

                    </ul>
                      <p> The sectoral commitments made under the CDN will be implemented through the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES) 2021-2025 and 2026-2030, the main planning tool of the Republic of Guinea, under the leadership of the Ministry of Planning and in close collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Forests. As part of the NDC Partnership and with the support of the World Bank, an investment plan for actions taken under the CDN is being drawn up, taking into account the investments planned for the national budget and the budget of the communities. territorial (unconditional commitments), and will be accompanied by a partnership plan intended to mobilize financial partners and the private sector (conditional budget). The cross-cutting measures to support the implementation and compliance with the transparency framework of the Paris Agreement will be subject to specific budgetary management by the Ministry of the Environment, Water and forests; the support of technical and financial partners for the application of these transversal measures, including the implementation of the evolution of the target institutional architecture is requested. </p>
                      <p> The Republic of Guinea, as a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), applies community directives and regulations in the areas targeted by its NDC (shared water resources, access to energy services, increased regional agricultural productivity, etc.). It also participates in the initiatives underway within the ECOWAS Commission to help harmonize the framework for monitoring climate finance flows in the regional space, for better comparability and enhanced climate action. To date, however, the Republic of Guinea sets its level of effort in application of article 4, §2, of the Paris Agreement, independently and not in concert with the other member states (article 4, § 16-18, of the Paris Agreement). </p>
                  <h2> <a> d. Application of the provisions of Decision 4 / CMA.1 relating to the information to be provided to make the NDC clear, transparent and understandable </a> </h2>
                  <p> When the first NDC was established in 2015, no specific guidelines or rules had been issued to harmonize the commitments of the country Parties and thus make them comparable. Like other countries, the Republic of Guinea has therefore made certain choices in terms of content and format. The provisions of the Book of Rules, adopted at COP24 and COP25 will only apply in 2024, for the second cycle of NDC, but countries are invited to take into account, as far as possible, these provisions from the start. 'update of their CDN in 2020 (<i> Decision 4 / CMA.1 §7 </i>). For the NDC revised in 2021, the Republic of Guinea wishes to start approaching the provisions that will become mandatory from 2024, intended to strengthen the transparency and confidence of the Parties. Thus, the Republic of Guinea has sought to improve the compliance of the mitigation section of its updated NDC with the provisions of the Paris Agreement and the Book of Rules (<i> Decision 4 / CMA / 2018/3 / Add. 1) </i>). To do this, the updated CDN specifies, in particular: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p> Quantifiable information on the benchmark of the target (s), including a baseline year. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p> Timelines and / or implementation periods, scope and coverage, planning processes. </p>

                    <li>
                      <p> The assumptions and methodological approaches used, in particular to estimate and account for GHG emissions. </p>

                      <p> Explanations of how the NDC is fair and ambitious, and how it contributes to the 2 ° C target. </p>

                    </ul>
                      <p> As an LDC, major challenges remain significant for the Republic of Guinea in order to apply all the provisions provided for (<i> Decision 1 / CP.21, § 31 </i>). This concerns in particular the baseline situation of the LULUCF sector with the urgent need to carry out a new forest inventory to accurately assess the current sequestration capacity of Guinean forests, but also to carry out an in-depth study of the vectors of deforestation. To this end, the Republic of Guinea requires the support of the international community to strengthen its capacities (<i> Paris Agreement, Art.11.3 </i>). </p>
                  <h2> <a> e. Application of modalities, procedures and guidelines for the purposes of the transparency framework for measures and support referred to in Article 13 of the Paris Agreement (Decision 18 / CMA.1) </a> </h2>
                  <p> The Republic of Guinea is committed to a continuous improvement of its transparency framework, so as to be able to write its first biennial report on transparency and its national inventory report, at the latest by December 31, 2024 (<i> Decision 18 / CMA.1 §3 </i>). Several major advances have been made in recent years and are already making it possible to better structure the transparency framework of the Republic of Guinea, in particular thanks to the results of the Statistical Law of 2014 and the regular publication of statistical yearbooks edited by the National Institute of Statistics . More recently, 2020 is marked by the start of the Integrated Management System for the Public Investment Program (SIGPIP) which should address the weaknesses highlighted by several audits of the monitoring and evaluation of public investments, including in the fight against climate change. . Finally, the Republic of Guinea is currently leading, as part of the development of its TCN, a process of improving the IGES system and the skills of the team in charge; This improvement is also accompanied in 2020 by the emergence of a network of climate focal points / climate referents within the sectoral ministries whose mandate is, among other things, to help collect data with a view to carrying out inventories of GES.

                  <h2> <a> f. Gender mainstreaming </a> </h2>
                  <p> With a gender index of 0.439 (SIGI Index OCDE), Guinea is among the 8 countries (78 out of 86) with the greatest disparities between women and men in the non-OECD space. According to the World Bank <a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"> <sup> 12 </sup> </a>, reducing gender inequalities in the Republic of Guinea could potentially accelerate the growth of GDP per capita by 0.6 percentage point per year or 10.2% in total by 2035. Beyond the fact that this increase in GDP is likely to strengthen capacities in general adaptation, gender mainstreaming in the adaptation and mitigation measures of the NDC is a priority given the tasks generally assigned to women in the household, their over-representation in the sectors most affected by climate change (agriculture, livestock and fisheries) but also their low representation in decision-making bodies. This priority is also underlined in the PNDES (2016-2020). </p>
                  <p> The mitigation and adaptation measures of the CDN are all likely to improve the adaptation capacities and resilience of women and vulnerable populations in Guinea as a priority. To target these groups as a priority, four transversal actions are priorities: (i) providing sufficient operating resources for the “Gender and Equity” services created in 2015 in all the ministries <a href = "# fn13" class = "footnoteRef" id = "fnref13"> <sup> 13 </sup> </a>, (ii) the integration of adaptation and mitigation issues into the resources dedicated to the National Fund to Support Women's Economic Activities (FONAEF ) and the National Fund for the Promotion of Gender (FNPG),

The impact indicators measure both the standard of living (prevalence of poverty, rate of malnutrition) and the quality of life (access to water and sanitation infrastructure) of women. The monitoring and results indicators aim to strengthen their autonomy and their place in decision-making bodies (improvement of skills, training in income-generating activities,

                  <p> <a> ENERGY SECTOR </a> </p>
                  <p> The energy sector accounts for emissions related to the following sectors: electricity production, industries including mining, transport, households and other gases from energy combustion. The emissions figures come from the 3rd IGES: in 2018, emissions related to the energy sector were 3,863 ktCO2 eq; according to projections, the sector's 2020 emissions amount to 4,475 ktCO2 eq </p>
                  <p> The energy consumption profile thus shows the growing share of fossil fuels in the energy mix. The growth in the consumption of fossil fuels is faster due to the growth observed in certain sectors, notably road transport and industrial and mining processes. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p> Electricity production </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> In 2018, 45% of Guinean households had access to electricity <a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. It should be noted that the rate of access to electricity in 2013 was only 18.1%, which reflects a recent sharp increase thanks to the commissioning of the Kaléta dam (2015). This progress should further accelerate significantly with the recent commissioning of the Souapiti dam, whose capacity of 450 megawatts (MW) will ultimately almost double the installed electrical power. The disparities between urban and rural areas are very strong: in rural areas (two thirds of the country's population) only 22.8% of households have access to electricity against 86.7% in urban areas. The mining sector is the main industrial source of demand for electricity. Guinea has a significant hydroelectric potential estimated at more than 6,000 MW (of which around 12% is currently exploited) as well as a significant solar potential (4.8 Kwhm² / day).</p>
                  <p> The authorities intend to realize this potential through the PNDES (2021-2025), the Energy Sector Development Policy Letter (LPDSE), the General Policy Declaration and the 2009-2025 Action Plan. In this regard, the strategic option of the PNDES is to contribute to the promotion of a model of sustainable energy development, based essentially on social and regional equity, renewable energies and environmental control of production and energy consumption. </p>
                  <p> Translated in terms of priorities, this strategic option involves (i) the rehabilitation of the production and distribution apparatus of the electricity sub-sector, (ii) the reform of its institutional framework, (iii ) mobilization of Guinean hydroelectric potential, in particular large and micro / mini power plants, (iv) promotion of "decentralized" solutions involving local communities and the private sector at the rural level, (v) promotion of solutions for the preservation of natural resources, (vi) recourse to innovative techniques such as biogas digesters (DAB), (vii) meeting the needs of rural and peri-urban areas for the implementation of a program of access to energy services,in accordance with the objectives of the Renewable Energy Policy (PERC) and the ECOWAS Energy Efficiency Policy (PEEC).</p>
                      <p>The PNDES therefore provides for: (i) the construction of several large hydroelectric projects; (ii) the continuation and completion of the institutional structural reforms initiated in the sector both at the central and decentralized levels (including the establishment of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework and restoration of the financial equilibrium of the EDG) ; (iii) electrification of rural localities; (iv) network extensions in peri-urban areas; (iv) diversification of energy sources by favoring renewable energies, in particular micro hydroelectric power stations, solar and wind energy, biomass and domestic fuels; (v) participation in the process of interconnection of sub-regional electricity networks. </p>

                  <p> Despite a difficult international economic situation, the reforms undertaken have allowed a resumption of investment in the bauxite and gold sector. The bauxite region of north-west Boké is in an unprecedented development dynamic. Global investments in mining projects could reach 50 billion USD in the next decade. </p>
                  <p> In three years, bauxite production has thus increased from 20.2 million tonnes (Mt) in 2014 to 87.7 Mt in 2020, an increase of 334% over the period <a href = "# fn16 "class =" footnoteRef "id =" fnref16 "> <sup> 16 </sup> </a>. The production outlook for the coming years follows the same trend. According to a CM Group study in 2018, by 2023, Guinea would supply 32% of world bauxite production (compared to around 16% in 2018). </p>
                  <p> The 2019 Sustainably Growing Guinea's Bauxite-Aluminum Industry report estimates that CO2 emissions could soar with the growth of the sector and the development of refinery activities. In fact, the production of one tonne of aluminum can emit from 1.7 tonnes to 23 tonnes of CO2 depending on the energy used during the processes, in particular during the smelting of aluminum <a href = "# fn17 "class =" footnoteRef "id =" fnref17 "> <sup> 17 </sup> </a>. The development of alumina refinement and aluminum smelting are therefore likely to very strongly increase the country's electricity demand and CO2 emissions if the capacities are not installed through renewable energies. </p>
                      <p> In addition, the Republic of Guinea has the world's largest untapped iron reserves, estimated at over 20 billion tonnes and of exceptional quality (iron content over 60%). The Simandou 1 & 2 lots were awarded in November 2020 to the SMB Winning consortium with signature of the conventions and ratifications by the parliament. This reallocation makes it possible over the period 2020-2030 to put this gigantic mining potential into operation. </p>
                      <p> The mine development program <a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"> <sup> 18 </sup> </a> foresees bauxite production by 2030 up to 150 million tonnes per year (MTPA), and the upgrading of iron deposits for around 140 MTPA. </p>
                      <p> The activity of mining sites could thus emit around 5,880 kTCO2 per year in 2030 in the BAU scenario <a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"> <sup> 19 </sup> </a>, broadcasts to which will be added: </p>

                      <p> The fourth pillar of the Mining Sector Development Program (PDSM) aims to preserve the natural capital affected by the mining sector through the following specific objectives: (i) clean technologies in the established mining industry, (ii ) protection of biological diversity in mining areas increased, (iii) systematic disaster risk assessment / management. It therefore does not include a climate change mitigation strategy or emission reduction targets. The strong growth of the sector, which exceeds the scenarios envisaged in 2015, therefore requires a consultation process with stakeholders to promote sustainable development. </p>

This sub-sector is the main source of fossil fuel consumption in Guinea, generating emissions of 2,155 ktCO2eq in 2018. Regarding infrastructure and services for other modes of transport, the PNDES is based on a multimodal approach to the development of transport, integrated into the sphere of agricultural production and mining.

                          <p> In the absence of precise data, emissions due to rice cultivation have not been assessed in the TCN but deserve to be studied in a specific way because they represent an interesting mitigation potential thanks to the improvement of practical. </p>
                          <p> Over the period 2013-2018, the cultivated areas of the main food sectors grew by around 4% per year on average, reaching 4.4 Mha in 2018 <a href = "# fn20" class = "footnoteRef" id = "fnref20"> <sup> 20 </sup> </a>. Livestock has also experienced growth of more than 5% per year, all herds combined. The assumption is that agricultural emissions will continue to grow by 6% per year on average. In 2020, based on the 2018 base year, emissions are estimated at 7,993 kTCO2eq. </p>
                          <p> Clear strategic orientations should be proposed in the next CDNs in order to accelerate the transition to slash-and-burn agriculture, controlled rice cultivation, and efficient use of agricultural residues. However, no quantified commitment appears on this sector in the 2021 NDC, given the country's priority food security issues. A more precise inventory of the sector's emissions and the evaluation and prioritization of potential mitigation measures is a priority to anticipate the country's next commitments for this strategic and high-emitting sector. </p>
                          <p> <h2> WASTE SECTOR </h2> </p>
                          <p> Emissions related to the waste sector are 298 ktCO2eq in 2018 with a growth of 3% by 2030. </p>
                          <p> So far solid waste has not been treated in the country, including in the largest cities, generating a significant shortfall in terms of health, the environment and the economy. </p>
                          <p> A large-scale project is however under study to collect the waste from Conakry and recover it in the form of electricity from the combustion of methane. This project provides for the collection of 1,740 ktons of cumulative treated waste by 2025 and 4,148 ktons cumulative by 2030. This would prevent around 110 kt CO2eq / year by 2030, and an accumulation of more than 900 kt CO2eq d 'here there (Bilan Carbone of the project). </p>
                          <p> <h2> UTCAFT SECTOR </h2> </p>
                          <p> Emissions linked to deforestation, degradation and forest management were estimated using an approach and methods consistent with the establishment of Forest Emission Reference Level (FREL) within the framework of the UNFCCC REDD + program. The FREL was carried out in 2021 and validated at the national level to specify the emissions from the LULUCF sector, for which national data remains very incomplete. <strong> The realization of a complete forest inventory remains a major priority of the country </strong> to assess the precise state of Guinean forests and the factors of deforestation in order to build a comprehensive strategy of protection and restoration, taking into account the fact that the national forest inventory is very old (1988). In particular, adapted and localized strategies must be developed for all the factors of deforestation, including primarily slash-and-burn agriculture or natural bush fires. Given the richness of Guinean forests in terms of biodiversity, it might be appropriate to integrate the monitoring of habitats and fauna present in the forest into a National Forest and Wildlife Inventory </p>
                          <p> The equations used for estimating emissions from deforestation, degradation and sustainable forest management were taken from Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the IPCC Guidelines (2006) and its Supplement (2019) . The “<i> Methods and Guidance Document (MGD)” </i> of the “Global Forest Observations Initiative” have also been used to implement the previously cited guidelines. </p>
                          <p> The LULUCF sector brings together the following REDD + activities: deforestation, forest degradation, forest management. For each of these activities, the emissions were calculated. These emissions and the methodologies used to calculate them are detailed below: </p>

                          <p> - Land use change and calculation of emissions linked to deforestation </p>
                          <p> Activity data, relating to land use change between 2015 and 2020, were produced using a land use change map. </p>
                          <p> Based on the 2014 land use map produced by NASA Goddard Space Center, the annual forest loss was mapped for the period 2015 to 2020 using a disturbance algorithm based on the NDVI and other disturbance indices available on Google Earth Engine. </p>

                          <p> In Guinea, the main cause of emissions from forest degradation is the consumption of fuelwood, which includes fuelwood and charcoal. </p>
                          <p> The calculation of emissions from fuelwood is based on census data and studies that analyzed and quantified the consumption of fuelwood and charcoal for rural and urban areas (INS 2014, PANEB 1999) ). In addition, since fuelwood consumption is directly related to the size and growth of the population, the demographic model of the National Statistics Institute was used to take into account the growth of the population and the increase. subsequent broadcasts. </p>

                  <p> As part of its participation in the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) in Paris in 2015, the Republic of Guinea presented to the international community its Planned Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) (<i> Lima Appeal for Climate Action §9 </i>) and identified the priority mitigation measures to be implemented in the energy sector, and in particular the production of electricity, forestry, and the extractive industries (<i> Paris Agreement, Art.4 </i>). The Republic of Guinea's GHG emissions levels are very low (1 ton of CO2 per year per capita excluding LULUCF), compared to a global average level. The development issue therefore remains a priority in order to meet the essential needs of the Guinean population. Nevertheless,
                  <p> Thus, in order to participate in the achievement of the overall objective defined in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, it is possible for the Republic of Guinea to reconcile economic growth and a low-emission development trajectory of carbon, and above all to avoid being “trapped” for decades by carbon-intensive infrastructure, particularly energy infrastructure. These efforts to limit the growth of GHG emissions, on the consumption of biomass-energy in particular, are also likely to generate co-benefits in terms of adaptation to climate change and thus participate in the implementation of the Paris Agreement (<i> Art.4 - §7 </i>). These efforts were built in line with the most recent prospective vision and planning documents: Guinea Vision 2040, National Strategy on Climate Change (SNCC, 2019), National Sustainable Development Strategy (SNDD 2019), National Development Plan Economic and Social (PNDES 2016-2020), National Response Plan against Covid-19. The revision of the CDN was also carried out by ensuring better gender integration in the CDN, both in the sectors and actions covered, and in the coordination and monitoring modalities. </p> National Response Plan against Covid-19.

                  <p> It was decided to base the baseline situation of this 2021 CDN on the data and projections from the 3rd IGES and the NERF, making it possible to build more robust ambition scenarios. These new data available make it possible to consolidate and strengthen the commitments made in 2015. </p>
                  <p> The emissions growth projections based on the 3rd IGES were obtained using the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Model (GACMO) tool. This tool makes it possible to calculate and monitor the reduction of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) in the following sectors: energy, waste, agriculture, industrial processes. </p>
                  <p> For the LULUCF sector, the emission scenarios were developed on the basis of NERF 2020 data. </p>
                  <p> In view of its LDC status and the importance of its development needs, the Republic of Guinea sets relative targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 compared to the baseline trend scenario. </p>
                  <p> The trend scenario (known as “Business-as-usual”) is built on the basis of the following assumptions, from the reference year 2020, pursuing emissions growth of 6% per year over the period 2020- 2030. </p>

                        <p> Electricity production followed an average annual growth of 17% over the period 2012-2018. During this period, the increase in capacity was brought to 40% by thermal power plants. </p>

                        <p> Guinea has a rich and varied heritage of biological diversity, including dense humid forests in its south-eastern part, dry forests in the north, dense mesophilic forests between Boké and Mamou via Kindia, and forests mangrove in the coastal zone. </p>
                        <p> These ecosystems are strongly threatened by growing human pressure, notably due to the consumption of biomass, shifting agriculture, bush fires and mining projects. Savannah ecosystems are also seeing a significant decrease in their area under agricultural pressure. </p>
                        <p> A recent forest inventory and a robust assessment of biomass flows would facilitate the construction of mitigation options and the assessment of their potential: this sector presents significant opportunities for sequestration and reduction of emissions. In general, the establishment of a sustainable, efficient and regular forest monitoring system is a priority and must be built with the institutions and agencies in charge. </p>
                        <p> The revised Forest Code of 2017 introduces a target of a forest cover rate of at least 30% of the national territory. </p>

                  <p>The commitments made under the CDN will be implemented through the PNDES, the main planning tool of the Republic of Guinea, under the guidance of the Ministry of Planning and in close collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment and Water and Forests. The PNDES 2021-2025 is being drawn up and will reflect the ambitions taken under the CDN.</p>
                  <p> The mobilization of resources for the implementation of the commitments of the CDN will go through a variety of sources of public funding (national budget, bilateral and multilateral public climate funding) but also private, given the economic sectors targeted by the CDN (mining, energy, forestry). It is therefore necessary to strengthen the private sector's commitment to finance and invest in the fight against climate change. </p>
                  <p> The Republic of Guinea is already well organized and equipped in terms of mobilizing the private sector through the actions of its Ministry in charge of investments and Public-Private Partnerships <a href="# fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>; several sectors of opportunity mentioned by the Ministry are closely linked to the actions integrated into the CDN (energy & hydraulics, agriculture, meteorological infrastructures, etc.). The strengthening of this private sector commitment is based on: (i) the definition of a detailed investment plan presenting the investment opportunities generated by the implementation of the CDN, by ensuring that these opportunities are consistent with those already put forward by the government; (ii) sensitization of the private sector so as to further engage it in the fight against climate change through incentives (more favorable terms for the private sector of public-private partnerships when they undertake to respect the national principles guiding the fight against climate change), sectoral meetings between peers in order to discuss technical itineraries and innovations in favor of the climate in Guinea, and the strict application of the sanctions provided for by law (Mining Code, forest code, water code, etc.). </p>
                  <p> In addition, the decentralization process has made significant progress since 2017, making local authorities a key player in sustainable development: the revision of the Local Authorities Code, the establishment of the National Agency for the Financing of Local Authorities (ANAFIC), under the supervision of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, responsible for managing the newly created National Local Development Fund (FNDL) and supplemented by a tax on the quantities of minerals produced and exported, the establishment of local executives in the 342 local authorities of the country following the local elections of February 2018. While a new planning phase at the municipal level is opening (2nd generation local development plans),the vertical integration of climate issues in local planning and budgeting exercises can allow a more systematic orientation towards climate-compatible investments and the territorialized implementation of the commitments of the CDN, making communities contributors to adaptation commitments and attenuation <a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
                  <p> Despite relatively dynamic growth, the Republic of Guinea requires financial and technical support from developed countries Parties to the Paris Agreement to mobilize additional funding for climate action provided for in the provisions of Article 9 of the Paris Agreement. Guinea's public debt stands at 43.4% of GDP at the end of 2020 and is expected to stabilize around 44% over the next five years <a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>; the risk of debt distress is considered moderate by international financial institutions. Guinea relies on loans at preferential conditions (concessional), because the additional debt capacity remains low despite this growth and the structural reforms undertaken to increase own budgetary resources. In this context, the Republic of Guinea conditions part of its contribution (CDN +) to the whole on the mobilization of financial resources that can be accounted for under the Financial Mechanism of the Convention. </p>
                  <h2>g. Intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement</h2>
                  <p> Guinea considers that the Parties to the Paris Agreement must strengthen their voluntary and concerted cooperation to raise the level of ambition of their mitigation and adaptation measures while seeking to reduce the total costs to achieve the global objectives of the Paris Agreement (Article 2). </p>
                  <p> Guinea wishes to express its interest and intention to voluntarily engage in cooperative approaches provided for in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, to finance its contribution to mitigation efforts which is conditional on obtaining international financial support, while providing a complementary response to its development needs to move towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>
                  <p> Guinea wishes to prepare as soon as possible to be able to participate actively in cooperative approaches, in particular within the framework of the market-based mechanism for sustainable development of article 6.4 but also of the non-market-based approaches that are planned. by Article 6.8, to help it in the implementation of its NDC by seeking synergies between its mitigation and adaptation measures, in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. </p>
                  <p> In particular, Guinea wishes to engage in these cooperative approaches to develop the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, in particular small hydropower, solar photovoltaic and wind power, as well as the deployment of improved stoves for 50% (conditional objective) of Guinean households to significantly reduce the pressure on forest resources and the resulting loss of remarkable biodiversity. </p>
                  <h2>h. To what extent does the Party consider its NDC fair and ambitious in light of its national situation?</h2>
                  <p> To improve the living conditions of its population and, more generally, raise the level of development of the country, the Republic of Guinea pursues economic growth objectives. A dynamic of increasing the overall level of production and consumption of goods and services often at the origin, as previously observed in similar situations, of a logical increase in GHG emissions per person. However, the Republic of Guinea intends to be part of the gradual decorrelation between economic growth and GHG emissions observed in the world since 1990. It aims to stabilize GHG emissions per capita (excluding LULUCF) at 1.2 tCO2 per year. horizon 2030 against 1.4 tCO2 in the trend scenario. This commitment reflects a decrease in the carbon intensity of Guinean GDP,
                  <p>It is therefore necessary to frame the future economic growth of the Republic of Guinea with significant commitments in favor of the climate, the investment cost of which is significant. In this regard, the role of the international community, through the orientation of climate finance, is essential. But while the Republic of Guinea is highly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, in addition to strategic resources for the ECOWAS-CILSS zone (water, forests, etc.), it is one of the three countries having obtained the least multilateral funding. climate, with around 35 million USD between 2003 and 2019.</p>

                  <h2>a. Impacts of climate change and vulnerabilities in the Republic of Guinea</h2>
                  <p> In 2015, the Republic of Guinea presented through its NDC, to the international community, the massive efforts that must be made by the country to face the negative impacts of climate change, as well as to assume its responsibilities by in relation to the vulnerability of the West African sub-region (<i> Paris Agreement, Art.7 </i>). The new work carried out since 2015 <a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"> <sup>26</sup></a> and the indicators available at international level <a href="#fn27 "class="footnoteRef "id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup> </a> confirm the particular vulnerability of several areas of Guinean society: agriculture-livestock, water resources, coastal zone and forestry sector. In addition, as already underlined in the National Adaptation Action Program (PANA, 2007), the effects of climate change affect the population unequally. Thus, the poor, the rural and those whose activity depends mainly on the exploitation of natural resources are the most vulnerable. According to data from the World Bank portal, it is expected according to the CMIP 5 model developed by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change): </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p> A general increase in average temperatures. According to different emission scenarios from the 5th IPCC report, the rise in temperatures will be between 1.1 and 3 degrees by 2060, and between 1.6 and 5.3 degrees by 2090, with an increase more important in the North of the country. Periods of high heat will be more intense in the North East of the country, regardless of the emissions scenario. </p>

                  <p> Pending the results of the national work in progress to refine climate projections on the basis of the most efficient climate models, this CDN undertakes to undertake so-called “no regrets” adaptation actions <a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>, that is to say which will have the effect of increasing the overall well-being of the population, regardless of uncertainties related to currently available climate projections (<i> Lima call for Climate Action §12 and Paris Agreement Art. 2.1.b </i>). </p>
                  <p> In addition to the implementation of several projects contributing to the adaptation of the territory, the efforts made by the Republic of Guinea since 2015 to implement its adaptation commitments are also tangible and made sustainable through: </p>

                      <p> The revision of the Environmental Code in 2019: incorporates three major points, which are i) the inclusion of provisions on climate change, renewable energies and energy efficiency (Title 6), ii) the creation of the Environment and Natural Capital Fund (Title 7) and iii) proposals to increase the level of sanctions. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p> The revision of the Forest Code in 2017: sets an objective of forest cover rate of at least 30% of the surface of the national territory, extends the definition of the forest domain (including trees outside forests) and gives new provisions more restrictive on exploitation and reforestation. </p>

                  <p> The National Adaptation Plan, currently under preparation, will constitute the communication document on the adaptation of the Republic of Guinea, taking into account the guidelines established in decision 5 / CP.17. However, while awaiting this document, the Republic of Guinea decides to communicate in its 1st NDC information consistent with Decision 9 / CMA.1, so as to demonstrate Guinea's priority to fight against the impacts of climate change. , to strengthen the support of the international community for the most urgent adaptation measures and to contribute to the global assessment, in particular to assess the achievement of the global adaptation objective (article 7 - Paris Agreement). </p>

                        <p> The Republic of Guinea is considered the “water tower of West Africa”. Four basins of capital importance for the sub-region, in particular because of the potential they contain in terms of economic development and maintenance of biodiversity, have their source in Guinea. </p>
                        <p> According to the latest national estimates, under the effect of climate change, the flow of rivers could experience reductions that could reach more than 50% of the current daily average by 2100. These estimates deserve to be revised in light of the current state of science, which is particularly uncertain about precipitation projections. </p>
                        <p> However, water resources should in any event face three main threats: i) the combination of strong population growth which increases the pressure on resources; ii) the development of economic activities which have a direct qualitative and quantitative impact (mines and hydraulic infrastructures); iii) the degradation of riverine forests and head springs which generate a decrease in flows. </p>
                        <p> It is therefore advisable to adopt a so-called “no regrets” strategy, that is to say one which increases the well-being of populations regardless of climate projections. </p>
                        <p> At the international level, given Guinea's strategic position, upstream of the main West African river basins, water resource management choices will inevitably have downstream impacts, beyond Guinean borders. These international implications make Guinea's responsibility for the sound management of its resources all the greater in the current context of climate change. The Republic of Guinea now has the necessary arsenal to implement a coherent policy, in particular through its National Water Policy (2018). The weakness of the country lies in the lack of coordination between actors and funding that would allow it to apply the targeted objectives,

                        <p> The coastal zone is a strategic zone in the Republic of Guinea. Indeed, it is the first economic zone of the country and shelters approximately 38% of the population. It also plays a fundamental role for the agricultural and energy sectors. It contributes 24% of national rice production. The agricultural land potential of Lower Guinea is 1.3 million hectares of which 380,000 ha are cultivated each year. Various cereal, fruit, vegetable and tuber crops are cultivated behind the mangroves. Of the 385,000 ha of mangrove initially existing, more than 140,000 ha have been converted into paddy fields. The latter also supplies 60% of the domestic energy of the capital and the main coastal towns. </p>
                        <p> The coastal zone is particularly vulnerable to climate change, due to the rise in sea level and the intensification of erosion on the coasts, with impacts on fishery resources, the destruction of infrastructure in coastal towns and villages and the disappearance or salinization of rice-growing plains. </p>
                        <p> All these elements make it an area subject to very strong pressure, due to the economic activities that are established there, the anarchic urbanization that is required, due to the lack of a coastal code and respect for the land code, and impacts of climate change. </p>
                        <p> Traditionally in charge of domestic tasks related to firewood, women are the first victims of a degradation of the coastal zone and its resources. In addition, they are more vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change due to fewer and more volatile resources, which constrain their adaptive capacity. </p>

                  <p> How the economic and social consequences of the response measures were taken into account in the development of the NDC; </p>
                  <p> As expressed previously, the climate projections for the Republic of Guinea need to be updated by the National Meteorological Department in the light of the most recent science in climate modeling. For the sake of consistency with the future national reference documents that will be the National Adaptation Plan and the Third National Communication, the adaptation component of this CDN is part of a so-called “no regrets” perspective. Thus, the adaptation measures envisaged today have been designed in order to increase the well-being of the population whatever happens, regardless of the uncertainties linked to the climate projections currently available, in particular in terms of changes in rainfall patterns. .
                  <p> Specific projects, measures and activities to be implemented to contribute to mitigation co-benefits, including information on adaptation plans that also produce mitigation co-benefits </p>
                  <p> First of all, the adaptation measures included in the CDN emphasize a fundamental concept: the polluter pays principle. Although it is incorporated into the legislation of the Republic of Guinea (Environment, Forestry, Water and Mining Code), this principle is struggling to be applied. Strengthening its implementation would have a dual benefit in terms of mitigation, namely constraining the largest emitters of GHGs and therefore limiting their emissions and providing an additional source of income for the legislator to set up virtuous projects. Then, the objective of restoring and preserving the heads of sources, banks and beds of watercourses is also a source of co-benefits in terms of mitigation. </p>
                  <h2> <a> e. Assessment of financing needs for adaptation commitments </a> </h2>
  <p> The costs of climate inaction include all the socio-economic losses induced by the effects of climate change, in the event that nothing has been put in place to mitigate and adapt to it. In other words, the cost of climate inaction represents the maximum level of damage potentially incurred by a society as a result of climate change. The recent work of the <i> World WorldlifeFund </i> (WWF) <a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"> <sup> 30 </sup> </a> measures this cost through the potential loss, due to climate change, of 6 ecosystem services. In the case of Guinea, the total cost of climate inaction using this approach is between $ 1.91 billion and $ 4.37 billion, depending on the theoretical choices on the discount rate, by 2050.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>
  <p> Note that this approach is a way of getting into the problem and making international comparisons, but remains indicative <a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>
  <p> For the purposes of the NDC, the cost of adaptation is measured through 2 complementary approaches, namely (i) an aggregate assessment at the national level, drawing on the methods used for global assessments, and (ii ) a pragmatic estimate of all the measures envisaged in the revision: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> The macroeconomic estimation is in line with the methods developed in the reports of international institutions <a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>, and corresponds to a so-called ``Bottom<i>up”</i> approach. Based on the existing literature, recent work by Chapagain et al. (2020) propose a model that establishes a causal relationship between climatic (temperature rise), socio-economic (per capita GDP) data and the cost of adaptation. By applying this method to the Republic of Guinea, the country will face total adaptation costs of between USD 713 million and USD 1,922 million by 2030, depending on climate projections and the discount rate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> The estimate by adaptation measure included in the NDC indicates that costs should rise to USD 1 billion by 2030. The consultants drew on feedback from projects already in place or planned in the Republic of Guinea to determine prospective costs in line with the targets set out in this revised CDN. Details of these targets and monitoring indicators are the subject of a separate document that will be included in the first transparency report (2024). </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> The Republic of Guinea will therefore have to face colossal costs to meet the challenge of adapting to climate change. However, faced with the potential costs of inaction and the scale of climate change, to which the country contributes very marginally, investing in adaptation measures is essential and rational. </p>
