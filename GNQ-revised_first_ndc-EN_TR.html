<h2><a>ABSTRACT</a><a></a></h2>
              <p>In 2015, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea prepared and submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). In 2018, it ratified the Paris agreement; whose main objective is to keep the increase in global average temperature below 2°C with respect to pre-industrial levels and to continue efforts to limit this temperature increase to 1.5°C.</p>
<p>At COP25, which took place in Madrid, it agreed that the states parties urgently increase the ambition of their NDCs and sectors.</p>
<p>Within this perspective, Equatorial Guinea has carried out this Update of its CDNs since 2019, being able to paralyze the process due to the COVID19 pandemic; resuming the process in 2021 with 9 consultancies and validation meetings.</p>
<p>The result of the INGEI, prepared from April 2021 to March 2021, was a progressive increase in GHG emissions. Bearing in mind that Equatorial Guinea's ambition in the first CDN was to reduce emissions by 20% by the year 2030, with the goal of reaching 50% by 2050, with reference to the year 2010. Equatorial Guinea's ambition in its updated CDN has been increased and has the objective of reducing emissions by 35% by the year 2030, with the goal of reaching 50% by 2050, with a total reduction of 379,291.54 Gg CO2eq, with reference to the year 2019 (446,215.38 Gg CO2eq). The next update will be in the year 2027.</p>
<p>To reduce these emissions, a series of adaptive activities, mitigation and transversal activities have been selected, which are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as well as territorial Priority Themes of the country and the fight against Climate Change, their sectors and departments involved; the estimation of the amounts required per action and possible sources of financing.</p>
<h2><a>1. INTRODUCTION</a><a></a></h2>
<p>One of the demands of the nineteenth Conference of the Parties (CoP-19) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in the city of Warsaw (Poland) in 2013, was to invite the country Parties to make efforts to initiate and intensify preparations for the preparation of the so-called Intended and Determined Contributions at the National Level (CPDN or NDCs in English), with the sole purpose of achieving a global commitment that tends to reduce to the maximum of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, in a binding global agreement.</p>
<p>COP17, held in Durban (South Africa) proposed to approve a <i><strong>Binding Agreement</strong></i> at COP21 in Paris, which was the priority issue of COP20, held in Lima (Peru), in December 2014, adopting decision 1/COP20.</p>
<p>The achievements obtained during COP 20 also include: i) strengthening the invitation and the definition of the deadline for each of the Parties to communicate to the UNFCCC secretariat their planned and determined contributions at the national level (known as INDCs, for its acronym in English and later became the first NDC at the time of ratification of the Paris Agreement); ii) the invitation to Parties to consider including adaptation initiatives or components in their NDCs; iii) the incentive for each country to be more ambitious in formulating its national contributions; and, iv) the request to the UNFCCC secretariat to prepare, no later than November 1, 2015, a synthesis report containing the aggregate effect of the NDCs that have been submitted by the Parties up to October 1. of 2015. To guarantee the applicability of the above, most of the countries Parties to the Convention are willing to participate in the common fight against climate change. For this reason, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, as a Party to the Convention, had to prepare and submit its first National Contribution; At that time, it reflected the reality of the country and justifies the political will of the Government to fight against the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Subsequently, during COP 21 and based on the actions and negotiations carried out within the framework of the Lima-Paris Agenda, 195 nations unanimously approved an unprecedented global agreement to combat climate change and promote measures and investments for a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future, the so-called Paris Agreement. The objectives of the Agreement are to keep the global average temperature increase below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to continue efforts to limit that temperature increase to 1.5°C. Additionally, the Agreement proposes increasing the capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and promoting climate resilience and development with low GHG emissions, as well as situating financial flows at a level compatible with a trajectory that leads to development under these characteristics.</p>
<p>COP21 held in 2015 has been key in the negotiations and high expectations for the future of Mother Earth, adopting the Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change. Since then, as an indicator of the political support of the parties, an initiative has been taken to implement the CRCs, prioritizing their scope, definition, obligation, as well as their transparency.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement states that all Parties must make and communicate ambitious efforts related to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which constitute the global response to climate change. In addition, it indicates that Parties aim to peak global GHG emissions as soon as possible, taking into account that developing countries will take longer to peak, and that GHG emissions thereafter should reduced rapidly, in accordance with the best available scientific information on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. Thus, each of the Parties must increase the ambition of their national contributions in the successive communications to the Convention, in periods of five years, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their respective capacities, in light of the different circumstances. national.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2018, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea ratified the Paris agreement.</p>
<p>COP25 took place in Madrid between December 2 and 15 with absolute normality and ended with the adoption of an agreement with the following clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multilateralism and science prevailed at COP25, and the agreement claims that scientific knowledge is the main axis that should guide decisions in the face of climate change and the increase in the ambition of countries and sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agreement calls for an increase in the ambition of commitments to fight climate change in 2020, following the calendar set out in the Paris Agreement and expresses the "urgent need" for these new commitments by countries to bridge the gap existing in the current ones, with respect to the Paris objective of avoiding a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commits to work and deepen the responses to the irreversible damage caused by climate change in the most vulnerable countries within the framework of the Loss and Damage Mechanism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agrees on a new Gender Plan to respond to the unequal effect of climate change on women and girls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The countries are summoned to work on the design of market mechanisms at the next COP that avoid double counting, that serve the ambition of the Paris Agreement and that guarantee the environmental integrity of the system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, COP25 gives impetus and recognition to the action of non-governmental actors from all sectors. The COPs are no longer just a forum for setting rules. In this sense, the final Decision recognizes the importance of non-governmental actors in climate action, invites them to increase their action in the fight against climate change and to generalize climate compatible strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these realities, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions to present its new ambition to the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>Through the update of the CRC, Equatorial Guinea reaffirms its commitment to the fight against climate change which requires, today as never before, the action of all countries. Our world is facing a far-reaching civilizational crisis with different facets: the adverse effects of climate change that manifest themselves in ecosystem imbalances exacerbated by an economic growth model that has not considered the limits of the environment and the planetary capacity of the systems that sustain life; a loss of bioculturalism and the richness of traditions that characterize our societies, where poverty is a lacerating manifestation of an exclusive and predatory growth model; as well as a health crisis which reminds us that the degradation of ecosystems caused by the excessive use of wildlife and health problems are intrinsically linked, and that these can compromise the social and economic well-being of our common home.</p>
<p>The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has adopted the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union Agenda 2063. Internalizing all this in the new National Plan for Economic and Social Development towards horizon 2035 (PNDES), prepared in 2019, in which 4 thematic blocks of national priority were established: Block 1, is the Eradication of Poverty, which focuses its analysis on the specific SDGs: SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG4, SDG6, SDG8 and SDG17; Block 2 is Social Inclusion and Sustainable Peace, which focuses its analysis on the specific SDGs: SDG5, SDG10, SDG16, SDG17; Block 3, which is Productivity and Industrialization, which focuses its analysis on the specific ODS: ODS8, ODS9 and ODS17 and, Block 4, Environmental Sustainability, which focuses on the specific ODS: ODS7, ODS11, ODS12, SDG13, SDG14, SDG15 and SDG17.</p>
<p>After this review of PNDS 2035, the COVID19 pandemic arrived in 2020, forcing nations to rethink their development models. In this context, the update of our CND in the framework of the Paris Agreement establishes the bases to move towards a responsible and sustainable recovery. The Government of Equatorial Guinea recognizes the close link between the protection of the environment and the well-being of the population as a necessary condition to access other dimensions of well-being such as health, food security and employment.</p>
<p>During COVID-19, the project to update the CDN and the INGEI (2014-2021) began, but progress was not made in 2020 due to the lack of data collection and institutional arrangements. As COVID-19 was reduced, the necessary data for the update were obtained.</p>
<p>Due to their nature, the contributions planned and determined at the national level in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea are articulated in two main thematic axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adaptation to climate change, as a vulnerable country; including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Integrating climate change and climate variability issues into policies and planning processes at the national, regional and local levels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of risk reduction strategies and adaptation measures in pilot sites;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen technical capacity to integrate climate risks into coastal zone management, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disseminate lessons learned to key stakeholders</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attenuation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere, taking into account the sectors most influential in the national climate impact:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Energy Sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industrial processes and product use sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use Change Sector</p>
                    </li>
<li>
<p>Waste Sector</p>
</li>
                  </ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For this, it is essential to guarantee both national and international financing, in order to meet the identified needs.</p>
<p>The objective of the Contribution is to establish the mechanisms for the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions <i>in the long term</i>; situate the progression of the countries in the fight against climate change in the period 2030-2050 in coherence with the post-2050 trajectory, with the purpose of containing the increase in Global Warming below 2ºC in relation to the pre-industrial period.</p>
                  <h2><a>2. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS</a><a></a></h2>
<h3><a>2.1. Institutional Arrangements</a><a></a></h3>
                        <p>Previously, the idea of developing institutional arrangements was not raised, in fact, in the INGEI carried out in 2013, few data could be collected at the national level, but a large part of the data was collected from sources of international organizations, which is why which, at present, the lack of existence of sectoral databases, the physical data files that are disordered, divided and with different results, the lack of accreditation and sectoral focal points, the lack of a regulation and/or strategy of data collection.</p>
<p>The current data collection campaign for the INGEI 2021, was carried out with the prioritization of the institutional arrangement prepared by the MAGBMA in 2019, for this, focal points were designated in departments of sectors involved, who attended the training carried out for him</p>
<p>MAGBMA on August 27, 2021 on the requirements for collecting data and how to keep it.</p>
<p>All those surveyed consider that the current data collection scheme for the INGEI is not giving the expected results because coordination is being more at the level of papers than in reality and the different sectoral ministries continue to function in a different way. parallel, highlighting that the institutional collaboration agreement drawn up by the MAGBMA in 2019 only three ministries (Interior and Local Corporations, Health and Social Welfare, and Fisheries and Water Resources) reacted positively by nominating their focal points.</p>
<p>The current system of institutional arrangements has sufficient human resources, but requires both logistical and economic support to effectively carry out its mission.</p>
<p>The Contribution of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has been prepared under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forests and the Environment, through the General Directorate of the Environment with the collaboration of the Group of Experts of the National Coordination of Climate Changes and UNDP International Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>The data collected in the documentation are of national origin and from international databases (FAO and IPCC), with a participatory approach of key actors.</p>

                        <p>Figure 1.- Operation of the institutional arrangement</p>
<h3><a>2.2. Participation of key actors in the CDN update process</a><a></a></h3>
<p>In the process of updating the CDN, we have worked with different key actors: 1) institutional actors in the collection of activity data for the update of INGEI 2021, 2) sectoral consulting actors, 3) actors in the validation of The consultants' reports involved those from the public sector, the private sector, civil society and international institutions.</p>
<p>The actors with activity data are: Ministry of Industry and Energy, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Ministry of Posts, Transport and Telecommunications, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forests and Environment, Ministry of Works Public, Housing and Urbanism and Ministry of the Interior and Local Corporations.</p>
<p>In the 9 workshops to validate the consultants' reports, the gender approach in participation was taken into account.</p>
<p>Taking into account the principles of access to information and public participation, there was also a participation and communications strategy for socializing and raising public awareness about climate change management in the country and updating the NDC through from a consultancy. To facilitate the effective participation of citizens, the communication pieces were designed based on a segmentation of actors that made it possible to maintain a multicultural and gender approach as much as possible, and to adapt the messages to the level of knowledge and the needs of information on the target audiences.</p>
<p>During the development of this update, an institutional diagnosis was carried out with the purpose of identifying deficiencies or problems in the existing institutional arrangements and proposing viable and feasible solutions. For this, the research technique focused on the review of work carried out, interviews with the leaders of entities in charge of climate change issues at the national level and including heads of sectorial departments prioritized in the INGEI carried out in 2013 and in accordance with the provisions in articles 4 and 12 of the UNFCCC, which say:</p>
<p>Art.4: All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and the specific nature of their national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances, should: a) Prepare, periodically update, publish and provide to the Conference of the Parties, in accordance with Article 12, national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not -6- controlled by the Montreal Protocol, using comparable methodologies to be agreed by the Conference of the Parties.</p>
<p>Art. 12: Each Party shall transmit to the Conference of the Parties, through the secretariat, the following items of information: a) A national inventory, to the extent its capabilities permit, of anthropogenic emissions from sources and removal by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, using comparable methodologies to be promoted and endorsed by the Conference of the Parties; b) A general description of the measures it has taken or intends to take to implement the Convention; and c) Any other information that the Party considers relevant to the achievement of the objective of the Convention and suitable for inclusion in its communication, including, if feasible, data relevant to the calculation of global emission trends.</p>
                  <h2><a>3. COUNTRY CONTEXT</a><a></a></h2>
                  <p>Equatorial Guinea has a surface area of 28,051 km² and is divided into two important regions: the Continental (26,000 km²) and the Insular (2,017 km²). Some Bays and Capes stand out, as is the case of Luba Bay, Cabo San Juan and Annobón (located in the southern hemisphere), as well as the islets of Corisco, Elobey Grande, Elobey Chico and Mbañé located in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Legend: RC = Continental Region and RI= Island Region</p>
                  <p><img width="366" height="315" alt="þÿ" src="img/GNQ-NDC1-2.png"></p>
                  <p>Figure 2.- Map of Equatorial Guinea.</p>
<p>The country is bordered to the north by Cameroon, to the east and south by Gabon, and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. Equatorial Guinea is well endowed with arable land and mineral resources ranging from gold, oil, uranium, diamond and columbite-tantalite. The country also has an Exclusive Economic Zone (marine surface) of 314,000 km², 11 times larger than the surface of the mainland, with 600 km of maritime coastline.</p>
<p>The population of Equatorial Guinea is 1,225,377 inhabitants (INEGE, 2015 Census), and presents a young structure characterized by a high number of children and a small number of elderly people (Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, 2002). According to the master plan "Equatorial Guinea Horizon 2020" (2007), 76.8% of the population is below the poverty line, which increases their vulnerability to the ability to respond to the crisis</p>
<p>increase in temperature, specifically due to drought and increased rainfall that brings with it floods. The economy rests to a large extent on the extraction of oil and liquefied gas, as well as the export of wood, cocoa and coffee.</p>
<p>The climate of Equatorial Guinea is of the “tropical rain forest” type with features of “tropical savannah” in its easternmost extreme. The average annual temperature is around 25ºC. The rains are abundant and regular and usually exceed 1,500 - 2,000 mm per year.</p>
<p>The main resources of the country are Agriculture, of a traditional and itinerant nature, which has prospered during the colonial era (cocoa, coffee, palm oil, coconut). This agriculture has known the same regression as forest exploitation, but it has never recovered. Only 8% of the country's surface has been dedicated to agriculture. Currently there are many projects to promote agriculture, such as model farms (pilot or experimental farms), which contribute to the emission into the atmosphere of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). Any extreme variability will bring a profound change in agriculture because it is small-scale.</p>
<p>Wood experienced a sharp decline after independence (1968), and then grew in the 1990s. The economy of Equatorial Guinea has rested in couple of previous decades on wood, right now it rests on oil.</p>
<p>According to the FAO, the rate of deforestation grows considerably from 58.2 km2 /year in 1990 to 150 km2 /year in the period 1990-2005, under the action of agricultural forests and very intensive logging. These figures correspond to a deforestation rate of 0.9% (FAO, 2005, in Obiang, 2014).</p>
<p>The latest FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010 (FRA) estimates that between 1990 and 2010 Equatorial Guinea has lost 12.6% of its total forest cover, which corresponds to an annual deforestation rate of 0.65%. While the GHG inventory study in the forestry sector carried out by Obiang (2014), has estimated a deforestation rate of 0.8%, which corresponds to 9.4 Gg of CO2 emissions, which effectively contribute to the greenhouse effect and therefore consequent to the climatic variability of the country and the world.</p>
<p>Oil production (barrels/year) in Equatorial Guinea began between 1992-1994 and reached its maximum peak in 2008, and is currently showing a drop. The burning of the gas produced in the oil plants increased every time oil production increased, and consequently an increase in GHG in the atmosphere, thus contributing to the local and global greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>Oil and gas have increased GDP spectacularly and without precedent, which was 83 thousand CFA in 1995 at the beginning of oil exploitation until it rose to 5,130 thousand CFA in 2007 (7.8 thousands of euros). More than 90% of the national GDP comes from oil resources. In 1994, the GDP per inhabitant was 201 dollars per inhabitant, while in 2008 the GDP reached 7,400 dollars per inhabitant (CEMAC, 2008). This increase in GDP helps the country to carry out large civil infrastructures, which contribute to deforestation and consequently to the emission of GHG into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In relation to biological diversity (fauna and flora), although exhaustive studies have not been carried out on what concerns the fauna of Equatorial Guinea, some studies carried out ensure a great diversity of animal and plant species (Senterre 1999 and 2005). In Bioko it is estimated that there are some 2000 species of plants of which more than 40 are endemic. The small ornithological studies carried out also ensure a great diversity of birds. Bioko Island also has about 65 species of mammals, of which 10 are primate species and among them seven subspecies of monkeys are endemic. The seven subspecies of monkeys are threatened by hunting by the island's inhabitants for the consumption of animal protein.</p>
<p>In the Continental Region, as in Bioko Island, there is a great diversity of mammals such as elephants (<i>Loxondonta africana</i>), gorillas (<i>Gorilla gorilla</i>) , chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), baboons (<i>Mandrillus sphinx</i>), panthers (<i>Panthera pardus</i>) and numerous species of antelopes, amphibians, reptiles and birds . The hunting of these species is appreciated and consequently a very serious threat. Additionally, the evidence of the significant increase in temperature and the change in precipitation in the locations under study, would lead to this diversity being increasingly in danger of extinction</p>
<p>Among the 55 National Legal Frameworks analyzed, it has been found that all are obsolete in relation to GHG, that is, they do not include articles or definitions on GHG Emissions, with the exception of PANDER, PNI-REDD+ and the Mitigation Plan for Civil Aviation.</p>
<p>Although the other legal frameworks have general aspects of Environmental Conservation that can contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, 45 of them lack Application Regulations.</p>
<h2><a>4. COUNTRY PROFILE IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE</a><a></a></h2>
<h3><a>4.1. Updated CDN alignment with the National Climate Change Policy (PNCC) and with relevant national planning instruments</a><a></a></h3>
<p>In the framework of the update of the CDN, it is sought that the projects to be financed are aligned with the priorities and strategies of the National Policies that contribute to the mitigation of Climate Change, which seek to guide public and private decisions towards development pathways that are climate resilient and low in carbon, and at the same time seek priorities and strategies that are focused on meeting national goals within the framework of the Paris Agreement with the NDCs.

<p>Likewise, it is considered relevant to align all these Plans with the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES), by 2035.</p>
<h3><a>4.2. Programs, plans and strategies most relevant to climate change in the Central African Region and the country.</a><a></a></h3>
<p>At the Central African Regional level, there is the <strong>Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC)</strong> and the <strong>Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC).</strong > The most relevant action plans in the context of climate change are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC)</strong> has an <i><strong>Catastrophic Risk Reduction Action Plan (PARRC) 2015-2030</strong> </i><i>,</i> which is inserted within its general policy on the environment and management of natural resources, specifically in its axes: (Axis 1) Fight against land degradation, drought and desertification; (Axis 4) Conservation and sustainable management of forest resources in Central Africa; and (Axis 5) Fight against climate change in Central Africa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the <strong>Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC)</strong>, there is a second <i><strong>Convergence Plan (PC) 2015-2025 towards a green economy</strong></i>. The purpose of this institution is that all the signatory countries of the treaty carry out common actions at the national level, guided by the Convergence Plan. This Plan has six (6) axes of intervention themes and 3 transversal ones. The intervention axis number 4 "fight against the effects of climate change and desertification", has a series of results that are expected from the member states, which include: (1) Increased capacity in the face of the effects of climate change, (2) Forest follow-up and monitoring systems, (3) Mitigation strategies (REDD+, Climate Plan, NAMA), (4) Control of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation from a reference level , (5) National action plans to combat desertification, and (6) Increase in reforested areas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a>At the level of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, the obligations of the UNFCCC have been fulfilled between the States Parties to the CEEAC and COMIFAC, preparing the following national reports:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a>First National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI) in 2013</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a>First National Communication (PCN) in 2019</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a>First National Adaptation Action Plan (PANA) in 2013</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a>First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2015</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a>4.3. GHG emissions and removals</a></h3>
<p>According to the PPFVC (2019), the relevant subsectors for emissions in the country are: Power Generation, 2) Forestry and change of uses, 3) Agriculture, 4) Transportation, 5) Waste, 6) Hydrocarbons , 7) Mining and 8) Use of energy in infrastructures.</p>
<p>The time series were harmonized as much as possible until the data series from 2014 to 2019 was achieved. The scope of the inventory was National.</p>
<p>The sectors inventoried according to the IPCC 2006 methodology were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Energy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industrial processes and product use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use Change</p>
                        </li>
<li>
<p><a>Waste</a><a></a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>4.4. GHG emissions in 2021</h3>
                      <p>Gross emissions do not include GHG emissions and removals from “Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry” (LULUCF), for a total of 17,037, 47 Gg CO2 eq. (Table 1). CO2 has the largest contributions to emissions with 96.47%, CH4 3.07% and N2O only contributes 0.46%.</p>

<p>Unlike gross emissions, in determining net emissions, GHG emissions and removals from the “Land use, land use change and forestry” sector are included. In Equatorial Guinea, the absorption of CO2 due to the growth of biomass in the forests exceeds the emissions produced in these due to the extraction of wood and other causes. The net absorptions of CO2eq in Equatorial Guinea resulted in a total of -256,831.76 Gg CO2 eq. (Table 2)</p>

<h3><a>4.5. Degree of vulnerability, loss and damage</a><a></a></h3>
<p>The change in temperature becomes increasingly acute both in the Insular and Continental Regions, as shown in the figure that presents the evolution from 1951 to 2008.</p>
  <p><img width="618" height="348" alt="image" src="img/GNQ-NDC1-3.png"></p>
  <p>Figure 3.- Variation of the monthly values of surface temperature for the period 1951-2008. The red line represents a moving average of 12 points.</p>
<p>Source: Ministry of Fisheries and Environment, 2013. PANA. Figure nº12 on page 34.</p>
<p>Equatorial Guinea, lacking meteorological stations for the measurement and evaluation of climatic factors (agrometeorology, hydrometeorology, wind isobars, etc.), has limited knowledge about climate change and its effects. Based on the forecasts made (MPMA, PANA, 2013), it is exposed to greater variability in rainfall (<i>drought in general, more showers and sunnier days</i>), higher temperatures and an increase in sea level (<i>along with more frequent storms and swells</i>). The population is confirming changes in the behavior of the climate such as more frequent storms, floods, dry springs and generally higher temperatures (MPMA, PANA, 2013). All this justifies its high vulnerability.</p>
<p>According to data from the only two meteorological stations of ASECNA (Agency for the Safety of Air Navigation in Africa and Madagascar) in Equatorial Guinea, located in Malabo and Bata respectively. In Malabo, the temperature in all its modalities (maximum, minimum and average) shows very upward trends in a statistically significant way, a result contrary to the temperature in Bata. This significant increase is very noticeable in the minimum temperature. At the precipitation level, it presents a cumulative precipitation without statistically significant trends. But the number of days with rain shows progressively increasing trends. In Bata, precipitation shows slight upward trends, but not statistically significant, and a downward trend in the number of rainy days (Obiang, 2016).</p>
<p>A <strong>Mann-Kendall trend test</strong> was used to determine whether or not a trend exists in the time series data. It is a nonparametric test, which means that no underlying assumption is made about the normality of the data. The hypotheses for the test are the following:</p>
<p>H 0 (null hypothesis): There is no trend present in the data. HA (Alternate Hypothesis): There is a trend in the data. (This could be a positive or negative trend)</p>
<p>If the p-value of the test is less than some significance level (common choices are 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01), then there is statistically significant evidence that a trend is present in the time series data. (Obiang, 2016).</p>
<p><img width="387" height="234" alt="þÿ" src="img/GNQ-NDC1-4.png"></p>

  <p>Figure 5. Mann-Kendall trend graph for mean temperature in Bata (Extracted from OBIANG 2016)</p>
<p>The sectors most vulnerable to the effects of climate change are considered: agriculture, fishing, energy, housing, education, sanitation, drainage (floods), health, and the environment (heat and high rainfall). The losses derived from these damages, despite being very considerable, are currently difficult to quantify economically in the absence of statistical records.</p>
<h2><a>5. UPDATED CRC AMBITION LEVEL</a><a></a></h2>
<p>The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is a developing country, whose economy depends exclusively on extractive industries and has to face a series of development challenges, such as: poverty, education, health, road infrastructure, etc. . Although, in terms of emissions, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea represents less than 0.1% of world emissions, however, the emission trend of some economic sectors is important without taking into account the absorption of forests, especially , Forestry 75.19%, energy 15.26%, industrial processes 9.28% and, finally, waste with 0.27%.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Government adopted the third National Plan for Economic and Social Development (PNDES) to Horizon 2035, which fits perfectly with the Sustainable Development Goals and the ambitions for the reduction of CO2 emissions since that is committed to the diversification of the economy, with a focus on the green economy (<i>tourism, forestry, business, productivity, etc.</i>.).</p>
<p>Compared to all the years inventoried, an improvement is observed in data collection in the last years 2018 and 2019, which is close to the reality of current emissions, all due to data from the industrial sector and waste. </p>
<p>A better quality of data is also observed in the forestry sector with the updated reports of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forests and Environment in collaboration with FAO, specifically in the latest reports on deforestation and the study of the level of reference forest emissions, which gave country-specific emission factors.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2017, the data is very poor, so the emissions were low.</p>
<p>The following graph in Figure No. 6 shows an increasing trend per year from 2014 to 2019, with the same projections for the future.</p>
      <p><img width="481" height="289" alt="þÿ" src="img/GNQ-NDC1-6.png"></p>
      <p>Figure 6. Increasing trend line of emissions 2014-2019 (Own preparation)</p>
<p>Based on the above, <strong>Equatorial Guinea's ambition in this CDN update is to reduce emissions by 35% by 2030, with the goal of reaching 50% by 2050.</strong></p>
<p>This, conditional on the support being favourable, predictable, and that the climate financing mechanisms are made viable and the distortions of the existing market mechanisms are corrected (that is, facilitating access to financing mechanisms). Favorable technical and financial support from both the national government and the international community is necessary.</p>
<p>Establish national emission reduction budgets in each sector for the period 2022-2030 by 2023 at the latest</p>
<p>The sectorial reduction proposal is as presented in table 3.</p>
<h2><a>6. SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF THE UPDATED CRC</a><a></a></h2>
<p>The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, aware that climate change is a phenomenon with an international dimension, which constitutes a priority and within the framework of its development policy, has set actions based on very specific objectives and guidelines. through the State structures, local authorities, the private sector, as well as Civil Society organizations. Said orientation is based on a series of adaptation and mitigation measures that are presented below.</p>
<p>The next revision will be in the year 2025</p>
