<body>
  <h1>Nationally Determined Contribution of the Republic of Haiti</h1>
  <p>FIRST UPDATE - 2021</p>

  <h2>FOREWORD</h2>
  <p>If climate change seemed like a distant phenomenon, it has been a stark planetary reality for at least two decades. They are one of the main environmental and development challenges facing the Republic of Haiti, a small island developing state.</p>
  <p>Such a situation leads the Haitian State to consider the issue of climate change as a major challenge for the sustainable socio-economic development of the country. Indeed, the related externalities are of unprecedented magnitude for our country, in terms of impacts on the physical structures of the territory and the sudden drains on national development efforts. In this regard, the losses and damages recorded in the country following the passage of certain extreme meteorological events over the past twenty years are symptomatic of the extent of the negative impact of the adverse conditions attributable to climate change on the sensitive sectors of Haitian national life.</p>
  <p>The threat is global and is part of global governance. Thus, since the entry into force of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, ratified by Haiti in 2016, the Parties are required, in the context of their obligations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to communicate their efforts, in the form of Nationally Determined Contribution-NDC, with the objective of keeping global warming well below 2°Celcius.</p>
  <p>In this perspective and despite the very low participation of the country in the process of global warming, the Republic of Haiti, clinging to the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities", has the privilege of presenting the updated version of its NDC.</p>
  <p>The updated NDC Haiti 2030, which the Ministry of the Environment of the Republic of Haiti presents here, reflects a strong political expression of the Government of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, to begin to lay the foundations for the reconstruction of a competitive Haitian space. sustainable dynamics. Aligning with the government's roadmap, national development priorities and sustainable development goals, the latter sets out the country's priorities and adaptation needs, the satisfaction of which will enable it to absorb climate shocks and bounce back from more solid foundations.</p>
  <p>The NDC Haiti 2030 is a document of hope, bringing many lasting transformations. It proposes to the nation ambitious objectives of cumulative reduction of more than 31% of GHG emissions distributed in the fields of waste, electricity, services, agriculture, forestry and land use. The country's resilience will also be strengthened through adaptation measures relating to agriculture, livestock, fishing, water resources, road infrastructure, coastal areas and health.</p>
  <p>To achieve this, the Republic of Haiti hopes, in the name of climate justice, to be able to count on the technical and financial support of the international community through multilateral mechanisms and instruments on climate change; as well as its appropriation by the different categories of key players in the country.</p>

      <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>Based on the objectives of its 2012-2030 Strategic Development Plan and its National Policy on Climate Change, the Republic of Haiti, in accordance with the requirements of the Paris Agreement, presents to the community of nations, the first update of its NDC. It was developed in a global scientific context inviting the countries Parties to the said agreement and its parent convention to redouble their efforts to raise the overall level of mitigation and the profile of adaptation.</p>
      <p>It is in this state of mind that the country carried out the work that led to the communication of this updated version of its NDC. The latter, apart from sections common to NDCs such as mitigation ambitions, information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, equity and ambition, adaptation measures, institutional framework and means implementation, also includes specific sections on gender and on loss and damage from anthropogenic climate change.</p>
      <p>By integrating these last two (2) sections in this first revision of the NDC, the Republic of Haiti wants to clearly signify their importance in its national planning system and in its sustainable development process. It finds it difficult to envisage the well-being of Haitian citizens of today and tomorrow as well as the preservation of the bases of national production without effective consideration of the concerns related to these two challenges.</p>
      <h3>1.1 NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</h3>
      <p>A small developing island state, Haiti is located in the heart of the Caribbean and shares the island of Hispaniola, of which it occupies the western third with the Dominican Republic. Haiti has the geographical particularity of having a territorial sea bordering on 30,000 km2 while the emerged lands occupy an area of  27,750 km2. At the same time, the country has ¾ of its area mountainous and rugged with steep slopes often greater than 40%.</p>
      <p>This particular geographical location gives Haiti a high ecosystem diversity in relation to its size. There are different plant formations corresponding to Holdridge's 9 life zones. At the same time, this same geographical situation makes it very exposed to extreme climatic events. Indeed, located on the privileged trajectory of cyclones, it is regularly the object of natural disasters such as increasingly severe floods. In addition, certain regions of the country, in particular a good part of the departments of the North-West, North-East, South-East and Center are from time to time confronted with episodes of drought. These exposures are amplified by particular geomorphological factors characterized by a highly rugged relief,</p>
      <p>Among the Small Island Developing States and the countries of the Hemisphere, Haiti is the country most vulnerable to climate change. Climatic risks (floods, droughts, hurricanes, etc.) are therefore very significant and these risks are greatly aggravated by climate change. These are associated with recurrent climatic phenomena: El Nino, which regularly creates a rainfall deficit and a much drier climate, and La Nina, which causes colder and wetter climatic conditions in the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>While being less able to cope with climatic disasters, Haiti is nevertheless one of the most affected territories in the world. According to the World Risk Report (Behlert et al., 2020)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Haiti ranks 22nd among the countries most at risk. Particularly incriminated are the country's high vulnerability and lack of capacity to react and adapt. This situation traps the country in a vicious circle of repeated disasters which constitute a major obstacle to development efforts and contribute to keeping its population in poverty. Indeed, natural disasters have a great impact on the national economy. Important socio-economic sectors for national development are seriously threatened. This is the case for the sectors of agriculture, fisheries, infrastructure, forests, water resources, among others. These sectors have been seriously weakened by the extreme climatic events of recent years. They suffered significant damage and are still struggling to recover. In recent decades, natural disasters have demonstrated the magnitude of the impacts of exogenous shocks on development gains through their repercussions on the Gross Domestic Product.</p>
          <p>Agriculture, the most important sector of economic activity in the Republic of Haiti in the sense that it employs more than 65% of the Haitian population, represents only 19% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020 against 30% in the 1980s. However, national agricultural production has continued to decline over the last decades until it no longer meets an increasingly growing national food demand. And, for good reason, the problems of insecurity linked to land tenure and the predominant informal land management methods, which are not favorable to sustainable investments, the small size of farms (1.8 ha on average), have come join climate-related issues which are manifested in particular by prolonged droughts which disrupt the cropping calendar, floods, cyclones and others.</p>
          <p>Each climatic episode leaves behind economic losses increasing annually. Thus, following the passage of cyclone Jeanne, the damage in the sector had been estimated by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, 2005)<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> at 845 million gourdes, or more than 20 million USD ( $1 USD = 40 Gdes). In 2008, Haiti was hit in turn by 4 hurricanes (Faye, Gustav, Hanna and Ike). Estimates made by the Haitian government put the damage in the sector at 125 million USD. In the same dynamic, Hurricane Matthew which hit the departments of the Great South of the country in 2016 had significant impacts and caused significant damage to the productive sectors in general and to agriculture in particular. The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (Government of the Republic of Haiti, 2017)<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> carried out at the time estimated the damage and losses caused to the agricultural sector at US$573.53 million. For annual and perennial crops alone, according to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF, 2016)<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, losses were around USD 150 million.</p>
          <p>In addition to agriculture, other sub-sectors such as fishing and livestock breeding are not spared by the vagaries of the weather. In the case of livestock, long periods of drought make water less and less available for livestock. At the same time, this activity is very exposed to strong winds, intense rains and floods. In fact, in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, livestock losses were estimated at US$70,121,783. Other damages, estimated at US$9,471,403 (MEF, 2016), concerned livestock products such as eggs, milk and honey.</p>
          <p>As for fishing, generally closely linked to the conditions of marine ecosystems, it is strongly affected by certain modifications attributable to climate change of anthropic origin. These, on the one hand, cause damage to installations as well as to fishing equipment. On the other hand, they make the type of fishing practiced in Haiti more difficult and put fishermen in a situation where they have to resort to other techniques and more efficient and adapted equipment to continue to engage in this activity.</p>
          <p>Civil engineering works such as roads, buildings, bridges as well as coastal infrastructures such as ports or even communication infrastructures and other tourist infrastructures are also very exposed to the effects of climatic events. They bear the brunt of the consequences of the repeated passages of floods and cyclones. For example, the damage and losses caused by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 on the tourism sector were assessed at US$15.5 million (Government of the Republic of Haiti, 2017).</p>
          <p>Water resources is another sector that is very vulnerable and hard hit by climate change. The scarcity of the resource is one of the major problems facing Haiti. Indeed, because of the increasingly long periods of drought, water is less available in some places and very scarce in others. Thus, despite significant investments, drinking water coverage remains very limited at the national level. Nearly 4 million people, or almost a third of the population, obtain their drinking water from an unimproved source, that is to say one that is inadequate for consumption. At the same time, prolonged droughts have caused a considerable drop in the flow of rivers already plagued by problems of erosion and sedimentation.</p>
          <p>Forests are also very vulnerable to climate change. Although they play a part in mitigating the phenomenon through their carbon sequestration potential, the fact remains that forest ecosystems are very sensitive to hurricanes and winds. The passage of Matthew in the southern part of the country left a devastated landscape characterized in particular by the loss of many trees which did not resist the violent winds of the hurricane. This is the case, in particular, of the forests of the Macaya National Natural Park, containing the greatest wealth of the country in terms of biodiversity, which has been affected by 95%, as is the forest of the protected areas "Grand Bois" and “Two breasts” (Government of the Republic of Haiti, 2017). Obviously, it is not always easy to make monetary estimates of the losses resulting from the damage caused to forests by these climatic events, but there is no doubt that the economic consequences are significant. In fact, following the passage of Hurricane Matthew, the Ministry of Economy and Finance estimated the cost of reforestation in the Macaya National Natural Park at USD 11 million (MEF, 2016).</p>
          <p>From the energy point of view, the energy needs in Haiti extend mainly to the sectors of residence, industry, transport, commerce and public services. They are covered by wood, petroleum products, bagasse and water. Benefiting from a strong potential in renewable energy that can satisfy all of its electricity needs, Haiti is still very dependent on the import of petroleum products, mobilizing almost 7% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Hydraulic energy in the production of electricity provides only 15%. Solar and wind energy are only exploited on a very small scale, as there is currently no device for transforming it into a useful form of energy (MTPTC, 2014)<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
          <p>While being a low emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) in comparison with industrialized countries, its agriculture constitutes, among the other sectors, the most important source of emissions. These could be mitigated by emphasizing different alternatives such as: increasing the share of renewable energies in electricity production, modernizing existing electrical installations, using energy-efficient stoves to replace traditional stoves, the improvement of the energy efficiency of coal production furnaces and the introduction of electric mobility in the main urban centres.</p>
          <p>The vulnerability of the energy sector to the impacts of climate change is mainly characterized by significant damage to associated infrastructure during the passage of extreme hydro-meteorological events. Witness the passage of hurricanes Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike in 2008 which caused losses and damages of 7.7 million US dollars in the electricity sub-sector. As for transport (land, sea and air), losses and damages were estimated at more than 75 million US dollars.</p>
          <p>Tourism is thus one of the most promising sectors of activity in relation to the development objectives set by the country. Straddling several other sectors such as transport, accommodation, catering, excursions and crafts, the Haitian tourism sector remains very dependent on the climate and very sensitive to the slightest effects affecting those on which it relies. At present, the problem of insecurity affects the attendance rate of both domestic and international visitors. Its contribution to GDP has dropped considerably.</p>
          <p>Compared to the Dominican Republic and Cuba, the figures are very alarming. For the year 2019 alone, the monetary amounts generated respectively by the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Haiti amount respectively in USD dollars to 14.7 trillion, 10.9 trillion and 0.8 trillion. They correspond at the same time to the percentage of GDP 17%, 10.6, 8.3%.</p>
          <p>While it is true that instability is one of the maximum constraints to the development of tourism in Haiti, it should however be noted that natural disasters will intensify further and undermine to a large extent the efforts made to revitalize the sector. Many accommodation and catering facilities located in coastal areas are very often subject to marine flooding. Transport, electricity, water and sanitation infrastructures that support the sector are also highly exposed to natural hazards. In 2016, according to the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Industries (MTIC), the destruction caused by Hurricane Matthew on tourism in Haiti was estimated at nearly 2 billion USD.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, the complex (political instability, the precarious social situation experienced by a good part of the population, the growing insecurity, the management of natural disasters) constitutes a bottleneck on which it will be necessary to act in order to reverse the degeneration of the tourism sector.</p>
          <p>In summary, repeated climatic disasters have serious consequences on various key sectors of the national economy. According to the latest Climate Risk Index (Eckstein et al., 2020)<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> developed by Germanwatch which analyzes the extent to which countries and regions have been affected by the impacts of climate and weather-related loss events (storms, floods , heat waves, etc.) and which is based on the average annual values over the period 1999-2018, Haiti ranks 3rd just behind Puerto Rico and Myanmar. Also, Germanwatch estimates that, over the last 20 years, Haiti has lost an average of nearly USD 400 million per year to follow up on the damage caused by climatic disasters.</p>
          <p>Despite the seriousness of the problems related to climate risks, nothing suggests that the situation will improve in the future. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change is expected to amplify existing climate-related risks and create new risks to natural and human systems. Some of these risks will be limited to a particular industry or region, while others will have cascading effects. For Haiti, such forecasts are very important and should be taken very seriously. Indeed, Haiti's vulnerability to climate change is considered in terms of variables such as the rise in sea level and the topography of Haiti, the increase in air temperature, changes in the average precipitation, and changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events.</p>
          <p>However, for Haiti, the climate forecasts with regard to these projected variables are hardly encouraging. The different scenarios show that climate change at the national scale should manifest itself in an increase in the annual average temperature of 0.8 to 1°C by 2030 and of 1.5 to 1.7°C by 2060. The episodes of drought are expected to be prolonged since the average annual precipitation is expected to drop by 6 to 20% by 2030; the projections range from –5.9% to –20.0% in 2030 while in 2060 they will vary from –10.6% to –35.8%. A reduction of more than 50% in precipitation and an increase in average temperatures of nearly 4°C are therefore forecast by 2080-2099. Some studies put forward the probability of an 80% increase in the frequency of Atlantic cyclones of category 4 and 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale for the next few decades. Everything suggests that, if nothing is done, the disasters will accelerate in the country.</p>
          <p>Although it is difficult to attribute the occurrence of extreme weather events to climate change, it is clear that the latter are likely to increase under a warmer climate and that the country must prepare to be systematically affected by said events .The great vulnerability of the key sectors of national development will not make it possible to resist the pressures that these sectors will undergo. With a major storm every 3 to 4 years, as powerful and devastating as Hurricane Matthew, we can probably expect significant economic losses per event for the next decade. The episodes of drought and flooding are likely to be longer and more pronounced, causing numerous crop losses in several agricultural regions of the country. By 2030, the negative annual variations in agricultural production due to these climatic shocks could rise to 8 to 10%.</p>
          <p>If climate issues are not seriously taken into account and if the support provided for in the various multilateral instruments on climate change is not adequately provided, Haiti will find it difficult to implement its adaptation priorities mentioned in the National Climate Change Policy. (PNCC), the National Action Program for Adaptation (NAPA), the Strategy Document for Climate Resilience (DSRC) and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), or even claim to achieve the national development objectives formulated in the Strategic Development Plan (PSDH) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Thus, it is the livelihoods, future and well-being of millions of young people who constitute the vast majority of its people who are compromised. Moreover, as an LDC and SIDS, the Republic of Haiti remains a very low emitter of GHGs. However, it remains determined to take the path of a just energy transition compatible with its quest for sustainable socio-economic development.</p>

      <h2>2. METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPING THE NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF HAITI</h2>
      <p>The NDC remains both a planning tool and a commitment document capable of contributing significantly to meeting the collective challenge of combating climate change. This constitutes the second generation and follows on from the first NDC drawn up within the framework of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 and ratified in April 2016. It takes into account all the concerns and sensitivities of all sectors of the national life: state institutions, the private sector, civil society, the parastatal sector, etc. It is therefore the result of a participatory and inclusive process giving it legitimacy and auguring a promising future in terms of ownership of the process and its implementation.</p>
      <p>In the wake of the same inclusive and participatory dynamic that led to the formulation of the 2015 NDC, the development of this first update of the NDC has gone through 3 major stages.</p>
      <p>A preliminary step from which discussions arose between the experts in charge of drafting the document and the decision-making team of the Ministry of the Environment, the entity responsible for coordinating the process. This step was reinforced by an in-depth analysis of the lessons learned from the first version of the NDC, its strengths and weaknesses as well as the shortcomings noted both in terms of the priority sectors and the targeting of the adaptation and mitigation measures promoted. At the same time, this step was reinforced by the use of key documents being prepared and finalized in relation to the fight against the harmful effects of climate change.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this step strived to</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>enhance the instructions and instructions of the sponsor in such a way as to meet their expectations</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>scale the degree of implementation of the original NDC in full scale while seeking to identify the blocking factors or constraints that have not made it possible to achieve the targeted objectives efficiently and effectively from a technical, managerial, financial and institutional, etc.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>seek the genuine involvement of the stakeholders concerned by the issue of the fight against climate change, in particular the State, civil society (private sector, NGOs, CBOs, etc.) and partners from international cooperation agencies</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <p>An actual consultation stage materialized by mixed Visio/face-to-face meetings and regional workshops</p>
          <h3>a) Visio/face-to-face meetings</h3>
          <p>They have endeavored to provide participants with a framework note targeting the relevance of the NDC, defining the objectives, the challenge, and the scope of the initiative and the challenges to be met. All this, through appropriate presentations followed by rich discussions. The idea underlying the approach consisted not only in stimulating the process of participation, appropriation and involvement of all the key players in the preparation of the collective work, but also in guaranteeing its legitimacy. Many institutions, sectors and resource persons took part in these meetings. They have also made it possible to profile and anticipate the level of effort to be made by each of the actors in terms of contribution from a technical and financial point of view, transfer of knowledge and know-how during the implementation of the updated NDC.</p>
          <h3>b) Realization of workshops</h3>
      <p>Four (4) regional workshops encompassing the ten (10) geographical departments of the country have been scheduled. Although they were carried out in a rather particular epidemiological and political context, they nevertheless offered the opportunity to (i) review both adaptation and mitigation measures (ii) decide in an inclusive manner on the mechanism interinstitutional umbrella organization for the NDC.</p>
      <p>A stage of formulation and validation of the updated NDC consisting in the drafting of the final document following a feedback process which took shape through systematic exchanges and consultations with/from all the actors. They were called upon to decide in particular on the relevance of the realistic adaptation and mitigation measures envisaged as well as on the ways and means for its implementation and evaluation.</p>

      <h2>3. REFERENCE SITUATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</h2>
      <p>The last GHG inventory for Haiti communicated in 2013 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is carried out for the year 2000. It was carried out according to the methodology of the 1996 revised guidelines of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC). For this year, the level of emissions amounts to 7832 Gg of CO2 equivalent. The updating of this inventory according to the 2006 IPCC guidelines by considering the new GWPs of the 3 main gases brings this figure to 8469 Gg CO2equivalent.</p>

      <h2>4. HAITI'S CONTRIBUTION TO MITIGATION</h2>
      <p>As in the initial version of the NDC, the mitigation objectives are expressed in relation to a reference scenario. This scenario is defined for 2030, taking the year 2000, corresponding to the year of the last national inventory submitted to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as the reference year.</p>
      <p>The baseline scenario has been revised to take this into account.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Recent developments and changes in the outlook for economic growth which visibly deviate from the projections of the "Strategic Plan for the Development of Haiti (PSDH)-Haiti Emergent 2030". Assumptions based on World Bank and CEPAL economic growth projections have been revised downwards and should not exceed 1.5% between 2020-2025 and 3% between 2025-2030;</p>
        </li>
  <li>
      <p>Growth projections for final energy consumption in toe/capita based on assumptions of 1.2% between 2020 and 2025 and 2.2% between 2025 and 2030, and;</p>
    </li>
        <li>
          <p>The updating of the national inventory according to the 2006 IPCC guidelines instead of the revised 1996 guidelines, which had a significant impact on the level of emissions for the reference year.</p>
        </li>
      <li>
      <p>Population growth assumptions remain unchanged. The same is true for the structure of the energy mix which stipulates that it will remain at 85% non-renewable thermal and 15% renewable by 2030, for the reference scenario.</p>
    </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following figure presents the revised reference scenario.</p>

              <p>Despite the health context characterized by COVID19, the highly unstable and difficult political situation and the earthquake of August 14, 2021 which affected the entire South, the NDC revision process was highly participatory. Stakeholder consultation sessions at the departmental level were supplemented by virtual expert consultation sessions and especially a national validation workshop. In addition, the revision of the NDC of Haiti has allowed better archiving and organization of data compared to the 2015 INDC.</p>
              <p>Adherence to the Paris Agreement has enabled the Republic of Haiti to aspire to place the country on the trajectory of green growth through the existence of key socio-economic sectors less sensitive to climate change with a great capacity to respond to adverse climatic conditions and geared towards the adoption of low-carbon technologies. This vision is explicitly expressed in the National Policy for the Fight against Climate Change (PNCC) published in 2019. To achieve this, the priorities are to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Develop and implement the National Low Carbon Emissions Development Strategy;</p>

      <h2>6. EQUITY AND AMBITION</h2>
      <p>Both LDCs and SIDS, the percentage of GHG emissions of the Republic of Haiti compared to total global emissions is 0.02%, which is extremely negligible. Indeed, its per capita GHG emissions are estimated at 1t of CO2 equivalent and are among the lowest on the planet. Nevertheless, clinging to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility of the UNFCCC and wanting to make its modest contribution to achieving the objective of the Paris Agreement relating to the limitation of the increase in the global temperature of the planet to 2°C or even 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels, the Republic of Haiti intends to carry out transformations in the main sectors emitting GHGs, in particular energy, waste and AFOLU. Thus, by 2030, it intends to reduce these emissions by 32% compared to the reference scenario, i.e. an increase of 1% compared to the initial NDC. It should be noted that the level of emissions of the reference scenario has been revised downwards following the consideration of new assumptions for the outlook for economic growth that have been greatly reduced. This level of ambition has been essentially guided by the narrowness of our island territory and the stage of our socio-economic development.</p>

      <h2>7. NATIONAL ADAPTATION GUIDELINES</h2>
      <p>Adaptation remains the main priority of the Republic of Haiti in the fight against climate change. The main political guidelines on the issue, including plans and programs, are set out in the PNCC, the NAPA and the NAP currently being drafted. Thus, this updated version of the NDC preferably emphasizes a set of measures to be favored in order to enhance the resilience of the various socio-ecological systems and sectors of the country, in particular agriculture, livestock, fisheries , water resources, health, energy, tourism, road infrastructure and education.</p>

              <p>Given the magnitude of the observed and projected negative impacts of extreme weather events and those of slow onset on the country's sensitive socio-economic sectors and ecosystems of great importance, the issue of loss and damage constitutes a major handicap for the development process. national sustainable development. Thus, the Haitian State, in this revised version of the NDC, highlights this problem by providing a non-exhaustive list of measures envisaged to deal with it, in particular to avoid, reduce and address the inevitable negative impacts of climate change (see Table 7). However, he takes the opportunity to invite the international community to broaden the scope of competences and actions of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) and to address the issue of loss and damage separately from adaptation now that the “attribution science” has made significant progress<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

      <h2>9. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
      <p>The cross-cutting nature of the issue of the fight against climate change militates in favor of the strong and active involvement of all the vital sectors of national life. This being admitted, any policy and any related initiative must be part of a multi-sectoral and or multi-actor dynamic with a view to building an integral vision of the approach to be adopted and which must culminate in an effective and coordinated fight against the phenomenon.</p>
      <p>To this end, the implementation of the updated NDC will be based on a consensual base at the national level where all development sectors and all components of society will be involved. This consensus will necessarily pass through the sensitization of all categories of the population and all sectors on the impacts of climatic phenomena at the general level and on each sector in particular.</p>
      <p>To this end, the institutional framework to be promoted will revolve around the development of a pragmatic, piloted multi-sectoral partnership.</p>
      <p><strong>PRAGMATIC MULTISECTORAL PARTNERSHIP:</strong></p>
      <p>It will be designed according to a framework and coordinated mechanisms for consultation and action. In other words, this framework should facilitate the involvement of all key development sectors on which the implementation of the said NDC will depend. Ultimately, it is a partnership framework that will not only help to integrate climate change into sectoral dynamics, but will also facilitate the development of sufficient synergies to better coordinate interventions.</p>
      <p>Today, the environment sector can count on a pool of partners ready to work together according to an institutional architecture, on specific issues related to climate change and which require a concerted approach. In this regard, the establishment of the National Committee on Climate Change (CNCC) made up of a group of sectoral ministries, representatives of local authorities, civil society, the private sector, the University, among others, must be seen as a fairly significant step in the right direction. The CNCC should serve as an operational arm for the Department of Climate Change (DCC) of the Ministry of the Environment, where questions related to the design, development, evaluation,</p>
      <p><strong>OPTIONAL CNCC TASKS:</strong></p>
      <p>Alongside the technical and strategic aspects that the CNCC must tackle, it must be able to support the Ministry of the Environment through the DCC in the mobilization of resources for the implementation of the actions listed in the NDC. That said, one of the segments of the CNCC to be strengthened is that in charge of negotiations and research for Financing, mobilization of human resources and technology transfer. This segment will have to be proactive and devote a good part of its operational time to planning and negotiating framework agreements in order to find the resources needed to implement the mitigation and adaptation measures provided for in the NDC.</p>
      <p>In this perspective, the overall financial envelope for the implementation of the actions provided for in the initial NDC was evaluated at 25.387 billion USD including 16.614 billion USD for adaptation actions and 8.773 billion USD for mitigation actions. However, with regard to the mobilization of these resources, little consideration has been given to the national effort which, despite its smallness, remains an important source of resources which, judiciously used, can make a valid contribution in the fight against climate change. In this sense, for the implementation of this revised NDC, funds from the public treasury should not be neglected.</p>
      <p>In this order of ideas. Significant advocacy must be undertaken with the country's political and financial authorities so that more resources are devoted to the implementation of the NDC, the total cost of implementation of which over the period 2021-2030 is estimated at 22,036 billion USD including 13 billion for adaptation initiatives, 4.98 billion for loss and damage and 4.056 billion for those relating to mitigation. In the same vein, arguing about the impact of climate change on investments, the contribution of the private business sector must also be stimulated.</p>
      <p>In addition to these contributions which should be taken into account, the sources identified in the 2015 NDC remain valid, such as the Green Climate Fund, the Adaptation Fund, the Global Environment Facility, the multilateral development banks development, Haiti's traditional donors such as bilateral cooperation agencies (Norwegian Cooperation, JICA, USAID, Canadian Cooperation, AFD, etc.) and multilateral cooperation.</p>
      <p>The amounts indicated above also include financial support for capacity building and technology transfer.</p>
      <p>A NDC funding strategy will be developed and implemented. In particular, it will integrate the mechanisms provided for in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and the contribution of the private sector to the financing of climate action.</p>

      <h2>10. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND NATIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING</h2>
      <p>For effective implementation of the various measures mentioned in this NDC, it is important to considerably strengthen the country's capacities on several aspects, in particular those relating to vulnerability assessment, the development of climate programs and projects, the establishment of appropriate inter-institutional coordination mechanisms, monitoring-evaluation and reporting of progress made following the actions carried out. Otherwise,
for more significant impacts, the capacity building and resource mobilization processes must be combined with a technology transfer process, particularly those that are appropriate to the Haitian context or selected as part of the technology needs assessment process of the country (in particular, photovoltaic solar power plants, solar water pumps, fruit orchards, agroforestry, impluvium, water meter, progressive terrace, gabionnage and raised construction). All programs or projects resulting from mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage measures must systematically include a capacity building component.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Haiti also plans to integrate capacity development into the Nationally Determined Contribution Implementation Strategy. In accordance with its National Policy for the Fight against Climate Change (PNCC), emphasis will be placed on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Continuous training and development of public service executives, private sector actors and civil society on vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation of change climatic;</p>
        </li>
      <li>
      <p>Deliberate involvement of academic institutions in training programs, research and systematic observation of all aspects related to climate change to inform regular updating of the Nationally Determined Contribution and participation in the global stocktake. In the agricultural sector in particular, the country's capacity building in agro-climatic risk modeling and the use of appropriate software such as DSSAT will be strongly encouraged.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
          <p>Improving institutional governance through, in particular, the revision of the legal framework, the implementation of the public education plan on climate change, the definition of mandates, processes and inter-institutional cooperation.</p>
        </li>
      <li>
      <p>The definition of a National Education Plan for Climate Change and Sustainable Development, the implementation of which should integrate the school curriculum from primary level.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

      <h2>11. CONSIDERATION OF GENDER IN THE NDC</h2>
      <p>Several studies have highlighted the differentiated vulnerability of girls and women to the negative impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2014)<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Women generally have a higher degree of vulnerability to adverse climatic conditions than men and therefore deserve special consideration in the development and implementation of response strategies to climate risks attributable to climate change. Furthermore, it is also recognized that a gender-sensitive approach is an important factor in ensuring the success of effective and sustainable adaptation and mitigation initiatives (Huyer, 2016)<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>In this perspective, during the process of this first revision of the NDC, a particular effort was made not only to include women and girls in the consultation workshops on the identification of adaptation and mitigation measures , but also to retain certain measures that will have a positive impact on their living conditions and that could contribute to their empowerment. To this participation and involvement of women and girls in the decision-making process of the adaptation and mitigation measures to be favored in this updated version of the NDC was added a critical analysis of the integration of the gender issue in climate change policy documents, including the initial NDC, and a key informant consultation on improvements.</p>
      <p>Following the observation of a fairly pronounced deficit with regard to the consideration of gender-related concerns in national policies and initiatives to combat climate change, the implementation of this updated version of the NDC will seek to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Promote initiatives that meet the specific needs of girls and women, especially those in situations of great vulnerability;</p>
        </li>
      <li>
      <p>Set up a specific working group on gender and climate change;</p>
    </li>
        <li>
          <p>Have at least one gender focal point sitting within the CNCC;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Strengthen girls' and women's access to relevant information on climate change, including climate technologies;</p>
        </li>
            <li>
              <p>Involve gender experts in the development and implementation of monitoring and evaluation frameworks for actions to combat climate change;</p>
            </li>
          <li>
          <p>Generate and disclose gender-specific data; and</p>
        </li>
            <li>
              <p>Support gender mainstreaming in the national development planning process, including in the allocation of financial resources.-</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h2>12. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING</h2>
      <p>Monitoring-evaluation and reporting constituted a major limitation in the implementation of the initial NDC. Indeed, there was a lack not only of data collection in connection with the implementation of the measures adopted, but also a lack of regular reports on the subject. Despite the development of an implementation strategy which specified the ways and means to materialize the ambitions in terms of mitigation and the priorities of adaptation of the country, it was
difficult to report on the progress of the NDC implementation process. This situation was explained in particular by the persistence of a particularly difficult socio-political situation which was detrimental in particular to the establishment of appropriate inter-institutional mechanisms essential for monitoring-evaluation and reporting activities. Nevertheless, the Haitian State, through the MDE, has not haggled over efforts to develop a prototype of an MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) system that would support the monitoring-evaluation and reporting system of this NDC updated.</p>
      <p>Said MRV system prototype consists of two (2) main segments including a coordination segment and an operational segment. At the center of the coordination segment, we find the CNCC coordinated by the MDE, through the DCC and under the leadership of the Primature, while at the operational level are mobilized several working groups whose main mandate is the collection of data in their fields of competence and a significant contribution to the production of reports on the implementation of the measures adopted in this updated version of the NDC. As foreseen in the prototype of the national MRV system, one of the first tasks of the entities involved in the monitoring-evaluation and reporting of the updated NDC is the definition of specific, measurable, realistic, relevant and defined indicators in the time.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>Carried out in a precarious socio-political context combined with an exceptional situation caused by the new coronavirus pandemic, the updated version of the NDC of the Republic presents the efforts that the country intends to deploy to contribute to the global fight against climate change, in particular the goals of containing the increase in global average temperature to 1.5<sup>o</sup>C above pre-industrial levels and reducing the negative impacts of climate change. These efforts were essentially guided by the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” forming the basis of the UNFCCC and taken up in the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>This updated version of the NDC has been nurtured by a participatory and inclusive process likely to promote its appropriation at the national level. However, as a small island developing state, the Republic of Haiti will not be able to do this alone, it will need sustained support from the international community. This support should not only be financial, but should also affect aspects relating to capacity building and technology transfer.</p>
