<h1>Nationally Determined Contributions of Iraq (NDC)</h1>
<h2><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2>
<p>This document is a voluntary national contribution and a vision that represents Iraq's supreme policy in dealing with the problem of climate change nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Iraq, as a developing country, believes that solutions to the problem of climate change will result only with the active participation of all countries and within the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, which are built on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility and according to circumstances, national capabilities and historical responsibility in the occurrence of this problem.</p>
<p>From an early age to accession to the agreement, Iraq began working on the implementation of many projects and studies aimed at adapting to the effects of climate change and mitigating emissions, but most of these projects have stopped completely as a result of the fierce confrontation with the terrorist gangs of ISIS, which caused catastrophic results that affected all sectors life and threatened security and community peace, complete destruction of infrastructure, and displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, in addition to the damage to the economic sector, which was already affected by fluctuation and low oil prices, the terrorist organization&rsquo;s control of a number of oil wells and oil and industrial facilities, and Iraq&rsquo;s compelling to allocate a large part of its financial budget to finance operations This is a real challenge that has contributed to draining the country&rsquo;s economic and human energies in the face of terrorism, and this situation has exacerbated the conditions of the Corona pandemic that it facedThe country, like the rest of the world, since the beginning of 2020 until now, has greatly affected the health reality, which is already suffering from fragility, weakness and lack of cadres of all kinds, in addition to the cracking of infrastructure as a result of the confrontations that the country has gone through, which led to an increase in the level of unemployment and poverty.</p>
<p>The impact of climate change on Iraq has been clear in the significant decrease in water resources in it and an increasing increase in temperature rates that exceed global rates, however, Iraq presents this ambitious plan in which all national plans and strategies related to climate change have been adopted to be compatible with needs and trends National development for all sectors to ensure the achievement of the desired goals nationally and internationally through qualitative and radical gradual transformations and according to the national capabilities available in the event that security and peace are achieved and economic resources are provided to ensure the achievement of a decent life for the people of Iraq.</p>
<h2><strong>Chapter One</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>National conditions and capabilities :</strong></h3>
<p>Iraq is located in southwest Asia within the dry and semi-arid regions. It has acquired from this site its semi-continental climate, influenced by the Mediterranean climate. The climate of Iraq is characterized by a wide daily and annual thermal range, due to the lack of large water bodies that reduce the coldness of winter and heat of summer, and the lack of rain In the direction from the northeast to the southwest, and due to its geographical location, it is considered one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of global warming and climatic changes in its multiple dimensions .</p>
<p>However, despite this, Iraq supports the global trend and the paths set by the Paris Agreement, which aims to preserve the planet and calls on the developed and major industrial countries to abide by the promises of mitigation, provide financial and technical support, transfer technology and implement transparently towards developing countries to help them implement their national contributions and achieve development goals sustainable development within its lands and enabling them to withstand through the establishment of a diversified, flexible and responsive economy to current and future climate changes. Therefore, Iraq&rsquo;s desire is strong towards the reconstruction of destroyed cities according to modern building regulations to become sustainable green cities that are environmentally friendly, so that they serve as living evidence of peace within the Iraqi society to encourage the use of renewable energy and green construction To ensure sustainability in the face of climate change risks, especially after the conditions of the Corona pandemic, which worsened the situation, as the future economic prospects for Iraq involve great challenges; Where it is expected to lead to a collapse in prices</p>
<p>Iraq has natural ecosystems rich in biodiversity, but its geographical location within the arid and semi-arid areas made it one of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of global climate change, and this is evidenced by climatic phenomena that were not known before, such as low rates of rain, low levels of lakes and rivers, and high temperatures at rates Unprecedented by more than double the global average, the occurrence of fires, the increase in the intensity and frequency of dust storms and the duration of their occurrence, and the increase in the phenomenon of desertification, which caused pressure on the ecosystems and the balances they cause, which contributed to reducing the spread of many types of endemic plants and the decrease or extinction of wild animals as a result of The impact of climate change, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ).This is considered a direct threat in terms of severity to ecosystems and biodiversity, but despite these pressures, large areas of Iraq are still of global and local importance, for example, the marshes areas, which were included on the World Heritage List for their importance, in addition to declaring many protected areas with Natural richness and the environmental services it provides with an important economic return.</p>
<p>Surface water is the main water resource in Iraq and consists of the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries and the Shatt al-Arab. There has been a significant decrease in Iraq&rsquo;s water resources due to the many dams and irrigation and development projects that were established on these rivers in neighboring countries to secure their water shares and use them to generate hydroelectric power, which affected Iraq&rsquo;s water share and quality, and the effects of climatic changes have caused a decrease in the quantities of water entering its rivers, The water sector is considered one of the most vulnerable sectors in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>The issue of the rise in the level, acidity and temperature of sea water is of great importance to Iraq, although the coast of our country on the Arabian Gulf is very narrow, but the rise in sea level could threaten the southern region with drowning, especially the province of Basra, which overlooks the Gulf, in which the economic power of Iraq is concentrated. In addition, the increase in temperature and acidity of these waters affects the biodiversity in the marine environment and coral reefs in the territorial waters of Iraq and also affects the tourism aspect in this area. Therefore, this topic is of exceptional importance in dealing with the file of climate change and its effects. Support the international community to identify the means to address this.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector is one of the most water consuming sectors in Iraq (about 35 billion cubic meters/year), where the water consumption rate in this sector constitutes 85%, due to the use of open and old irrigation channels, the fragility or weakness of the management of water resources and dilapidated infrastructure, and the use of techniques Old irrigation (surface irrigation) for some crops such as rice and traditional farming patterns. The quantities of irrigation water exceeded the specified water quotas, which, over time, led to a rise in water levels in them, waterlogging and salinization of the soil .</p>
<p>The transport sector is one of the important sectors in the economy of any country. In addition, all economic and life activities and activities such as shopping, housing and entertainment cannot perform their role and function without linking to transport lines because of the impact of other economic sectors such as industry, trade and tourism, and this sector suffers from deteriorating structures. Infrastructure, which is the mainstay for the development of transportation, due to the lack of laws, legislation and projects that support the trend towards sustainable, collective and environmentally friendly transportation.</p>
<p>Iraq suffers from a severe weakness in the infrastructure supporting the industrial sector, due to the lack of cities and industrial areas that have the necessary infrastructure to establish various industries, in addition to the weak infrastructure supporting industry and investment, which contributed to the deterioration of this sector. The weakness of the comprehensive knowledge infrastructure for communications and information technology networks, as well as the infrastructure for standards, metrology and quality, with the weakness of efforts made to support the private sector to become a key partner in economic development through clear and developed programs, and all this clearly and tangibly affected the reality of the industrial sector and its inability to keep pace with the march global in progress.</p>
<h3><strong>Environmental laws and regulations:</strong></h3>
<p>The Iraqi state, especially after 2003, issued many legislations aimed at protecting the environment, but the country's security conditions did not help in their full implementation, and there is a need for other legislation and updating the existing ones to cope with the requirements of facing climate changes.</p>
<h3><strong>Environmental Awareness:</strong></h3>
<p>Environmental awareness is a generalization and deepening of environmental knowledge among all segments and groups of society through appropriate environmental means and messages for each of them and motivating them to contribute and participate individually and collectively in protecting the environment and preserving its resources. Given that climate change is the problem of the times and that women and children are more vulnerable than men to the problem of climate change, which It requires full environmental awareness towards climate changes and the development of strategies, plans, laws and legislations for environmental awareness among all segments of society, especially the vulnerable groups.</p>
<h3><strong>research and development:</strong></h3>
<p>Addressing climate change requires strengthening scientific research and technological development in several areas, including technology transfer, economic aspects, industry, oil, energy, transportation development, and other areas related to climate change and citizen's life in order to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to it. Giving importance to this aspect and providing the opportunity to prepare extensive and in-depth studies on climate change and its multifaceted effects and support graduate students (Masters and Ph. The Iraqi environmental, economic and social reality.</p>
<h2><strong>Chapter Two</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Climate change impacts, fragility and adaptation measures</strong></h3>
<p>The effects of climate change on the various Iraqi sectors have become known to all and have cast a shadow over life in Iraq, especially in light of the fragile conditions of the country and dilapidated infrastructure. Economic, health and life in general, where projections based on national numerical climate models indicate a steady increase in temperature ranging from (0.9 &deg; C) since 2007, it may reach (3.5 &deg; C) in the year 2100 according to the aforementioned forecasts, which increases From the critical situation in a country where the temperature has risen above (50 &deg; C)) in a number of summer days of the year, not to mention the obvious decrease in the annual rates of precipitation, which are expected to witness a significant and continuous decrease, which may reach in the year 2100 to a decrease of more than 30% from its rates during the period 1938-1978 according to the forecasts of the authority The general weather forecast and Iraqi seismic monitoring, and this is a clear indication of the reasons for the clear increase in the occurrence of extreme cases such as heat waves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. Suddenly, there are, for example, large waves of drought that led to an increase in desertification, which affected the increase in dust and dust storms During the year, the intensity, frequency, recurrence and duration of it led to a noticeable increase in the number of asthma cases in the Iraqi society, especially among children and the elderly, and the spread of diseases and cancers significantly in recent years. In addition, climate change has exacerbated the problem of water scarcity in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries. As indicated by the bank's estimatesThe 2011 International Convention on the existence of a significant shortage and scarcity of renewable water resources for Iraq compared to the actual need during the period from 2000 to 2009, while this percentage is expected to reach 37% during the period from 2020 to 2030, which will increase to 51% during the period from 2040 Until 2050, this explains the reason for the great collapse in the agricultural sector, which left its clear effects on agricultural production, the economy of Iraq, natural systems, biodiversity, loss of vegetation cover, and the threat to coastal marine areas overlooking the Arabian Gulf, especially in Basra Governorate in southern Iraq, due to sea level rise and warming. Water and the impact on coral reefs and biodiversity in the marine environment and the loss of coastal lands, in addition to its effects on the energy sector, because Basra Governorate is the main center for oil wealth in Iraq, which created pressure on the national economy and a threat to the stability of the country and made itIt is very difficult to achieve sustainable development in all its vital sectorsThis hinders our ambitions in sustainable development and economic development , which calls for rapid intervention and finding solutions based on nature to save these natural systems after they were and still are the main contributors to the stability of the climate of Iraq and the world, especially in the last ten thousand years. One of the five most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change, according to the sixth report of the State of the Global Environment Outlook for Western Asia ( GEO-6).</p>
<p>Iraq is preparing a National Adaptation Plan ( NAP) with funding from the Green Climate Fund ( GCF) in cooperation with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)Which will be among the basic plans that the country will rely on in implementing this policy to ensure flexibility for all priority fragile national sectors during the next three years to reduce potential risks and find effective means to sustain water sources and address acute water scarcity and the deterioration of its quality. As a result of the difficult economic conditions that Iraq is going through, especially after the Corona pandemic and the accompanying unprecedented drop in oil prices, its implementation of this policy will require regional cooperation and international support to enable it to establish strong health systems that are resilient and resistant to difficult conditions to protect human health, protect natural systems and biodiversity and enhance Resilience to the impacts and disaster risks associated with local climate change scenarios and enhance adaptation in fragile sectors.</p>
<p>In view of the synergistic relationship between sectors, the preparation and implementation of an action plan for adaptation measures and the achievement of the required benefits for each of the main sectors affected by climate change and within the framework of national and sectoral strategies related to them, such as the national water strategy, the national strategy for agriculture, the national biodiversity strategy and the national framework for integrated management of risks Drought in Iraq, will lead to strengthening the national capacity to face the effects of climate change on different sectors, especially those sectors that are most sensitive and vulnerable to being affected, as follows:</p>

<h2><strong>Chapter Three</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Mitigation measures and co-benefits:</strong></h3>
<p>The main objective of mitigation policies is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taking measures and plans to prepare a document that achieves a balance between the requirements of the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement attached to it on the one hand, diversifying the sources of the economy, sustainability of exports of fossil fuels and the stability of the global market for this type of fuel from On the other hand, to ensure the achievement of the sustainable development goals until suitable alternatives are found and to limit the impact of response measures taken by developed countries on the economies of developing countries and the negative social and environmental repercussions that will cast a shadow on the national economy in the event such measures are taken.</p>
<p>The amount of the reduction will be determined according to the nationally appropriate mitigation measures that Iraq will submit to the agreement&rsquo;s secretariat in the future in the form of plans, strategies, programs and projects, which will depend on the amount of the baseline for the usual amount of work for each project that includes a reduction in emissions and according to the main emitting sectors, targeting the main gases in the approved greenhouse gas regulations The IPCC hascarbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.</p>
<p>The most important sectors through which Iraq will work to achieve the goals of its national contributions in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and diversifying the sources of its national economy are the oil, gas, electricity, industry, trade, agriculture, transportation, waste and housing sectors.</p>

<p>The pathways aimed at mitigating the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases can be described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wide dissemination of the culture of environmentally friendly technologies that reduce emissions to include all types of target gases, with a focus on mechanisms related to improving energy efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobilize efforts for mitigation measures to include all triggers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dissemination of knowledge and capacity-building with the support provided by the developed countries to the developing countries to ensure consistency between the parties&rsquo; states to ensure balance and justice in opportunities, taking into account the national conditions and needs of each country.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Iraq has worked from an early age to join the agreement and then sign the Paris Agreement to work on implementing projects and strategic studies to introduce clean and renewable energies, improve energy efficiency, sound environmental management of carbon and increase the area of ​​green spaces, and projects related to the introduction of liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG) fuel as a vehicle fuel have been started In addition to the traditional fuels used and other pioneering projects in these areas and for many national sectors, including working to convert the lighting of many main streets in Baghdad to work with solar energy, and developing future plans to convert some electric power plants to combined cycle stations to reduce fuel use and increase production. In addition to taking many measures and policies that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awareness of the importance of rationalizing energy consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spreading the culture of using LEDenergy-saving lighting on all government and commercial buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuance of energy efficiency labels by the Central Agency for Standardization and Quality Control to ensure the use of environmentally friendly goods and services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tire recycling by the Ministry of Industry to achieve a reduction in emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuing green building codes, which are considered a policy in establishing smart green buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuance of the solar energy law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment of associated gas in the Basra Gas Company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to projects that have been implemented in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, such as the establishment of power plants that operate on liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG) fuel instead of heavy fuel, and the establishment of brick factories using LPG .Instead of black oil, as well as iron production plants that operate on gasoline instead of black oil, and there are many projects underway, such as the associated gas investment project for power generation, cement plants that operate with the technology of investing waste and converting it into energy, a project to invest associated gas to produce electric power, and a treatment project Sewage water and its reuse for green belt irrigation, which is implemented in cooperation with the Japanese organization JICA in Erbil governorate, not to mention afforestation, increasing forest areas and planting green belts, noting that most of the new cities that are being built in the Kurdistan Region are sustainable cities that depend on smart lighting and recycling Using sewage for irrigation to increase green spaces and many more.</p>
<p>International support and technology transfer are of exceptional importance in preventing the waste of associated gas, which is an important economic wealth if invested, in addition to achieving a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency estimates that leaks of methane (the main component of natural gas) in Iraq could be reduced by more than 80% using existing technology. The financial value of methane emissions in Iraq is estimated at more than 600 million dollars, which represents a great economic loss. In addition to the economic benefits that the investment of this gas will bring to Iraq, reducing methane emissions protects human health by improving air quality at the local level.</p>
<p><strong>The following is a description of the pathways approved by the national sectors:</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>1- Energy sector (oil, gas, electricity and transportation):</u></strong></p>
<p>Through this vital sector, Iraq seeks to voluntarily reduce its emissions if security and peace are provided on the one hand, and the developed countries fulfill their obligations in terms of financing, transfer of environmentally friendly technology and capacity building on the other hand, as the highest rate of greenhouse gas emissions results from this sector, according to what was stated in a document The first national communication, as it contributes 75% of the total emissions of Iraq, therefore, taking the following measures to reduce the emissions of this sector will be feasible from a development point of view:</p>

<h3><strong>Monitoring, Reporting and Verification:</strong></h3>
<p>The monitoring, reporting and verification system is considered one of the most important requirements necessary to build a transparent system that reflects our needs according to a solid methodology through which we can draw clear paths to describe the necessary legislation, laws, and instructions to mitigate emissions and the repercussions of this on adaptation. Emissions in measured quantities that can be reported with the availability of numerical measurements based on a legislative ground that includes all sectors.</p>
<p>Through the support mechanisms in the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, and in cooperation with the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ), Iraq seeksto obtain the necessary support to design the required monitoring form according to each sector, provided that it includes all forms of activities and for all sectors in a flexible and scalable manner, as Iraq realizes that these systems It will improve the transparency framework in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>National inventory and reporting of greenhouse gases for each emitting activity.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Incentivizing oil and gas companies operating in Iraq to report methane emissions within known transparent frameworks, such as the Oil, Gas and Methane Partnership Framework (OGMP).</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Collaborate on campaigns to directly measure methane from oil and gas facilities and use satellite data to establish a baseline for emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Assessment of progress in implementing the Nationally Determined Contribution.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Identifying and assessing the adverse effects of climate change on fragile sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Describe the co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The effect of implementing response measures on the national economy.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Assessment of national needs and the type of climate technology that contributes to achieving sustainable development goals.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Determine the type of capacity that needs to be built to ensure feasible national mitigation measures in creating green jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Determining the type of financing and investment that guarantees the implementation of the national contribution in accordance with the country's national policy.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Localize technologies and software that have the ability to design predictive models for mitigation and adaptation</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Describe the features of verification of actions taken to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Determining the type, shape and level of institutional structures required in accordance with international and national trends to confront climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Iraq is determined to advance the climate change file because it realizes its danger at all levels while it seeks to establish the concepts of a green economy. However, the National Center for Climate Change, which represents the institutional structure concerned with managing climate changes nationally, still needs more support and backing, in order to Building and managing an integrated and transparent system for measurement, reporting and verification in particular, and advancing the reality of the climate change file in general, as international financial, technical and diplomatic support must be provided to upgrade the type of climate capabilities and skills to enable it to participate in international, regional and national policy-making for the participation of the international community in its actions to reduce the phenomenon Climate change.</p>
