<h1>Towards the Nationally Determined Contributions document, the new climate change agreement</h1>
<h1>Iraq</h1>
<p>This document is presented in response to the call of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</p>
<p>10/11/2015</p>
<p>This contribution does not constitute a binding commitment to Iraq, but rather it is a voluntary national contribution to demonstrate what has been taken, and from us, Iraq&rsquo;s national security forces need support and internal stability in order to achieve an actual contribution with the international community to stabilize the high rates of carbon dioxide emissions from Canada and to prevent national liberties and the national and international development funds. And Al-Qanahira, which comes to light, and here Al-Anraq, as a result of the fierce attack that it is being subjected to before the terrorist rewards of ISIS, and what accompanies it, as an artist, the growth, the contracts and the acquisitions. The fragile and scattered meetings as a result of climate change to enable them to configure their types, provide support to them and implement the framework agreement exchanges.</p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This special report and Iraq's specific national contribution in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change presents Iraq's vision in terms of cooperation with the international community, technical mitigation, prevention of emissions, and our commitments towards it to the agreement as it has been working for Iraq since its development. The climate is upon us, and here we are, let us tell you, we will tell you, we will tell you, we will tell you, we will tell you, we will tell you, you will know how many years, we will send out the greenhouses, and we will know the strategies of masking and camouflaging the climate change in the country.</p>
<p>Iraq would like to express its pleasure and will not be the support of the international community in providing our nationally determined contributions to the participation of the world towards stabilizing the height and the tuberculosis of the heat, which is the name of the Neanderthals, who are calling for the Neanderthals to be 2&ordm;C about their rates before the industrial revolution. This report comes in response to the call of the 19th Conference of the Parties to the Convention.</p>
<p>The national, regional, and international co-ordination work for the implementation of this national document that expresses our desire and the participation of brands, which was prepared by a national working group consisting of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and social security organizations. The Center met with the implementation and coordination of this team and the approvals of the Permanent National Committee on Climate Changes, and it hoped for national validation and the adoption of the methodology of consultation with the relevant authorities, decision-makers, and national experts, and through the establishment of several workshops, and a workshop for all senior policy makers in the country The decision is relevant to the ability to present a report representing Iraq's repercussions towards a future that provides the present and future arenas with decent living and sustainable resources.</p>
<p>The county and county have adopted this document as well as the national integrated strategies and frameworks, the most important of which are the integrated national strategy for health, the national environment strategy and other relevant strategies.</p>
<p>Despite the well-known suffering of Iraq, the most important of which is the security situation and the stagnation of the conflict, which represent special challenges that make it a place for applying sustainable development mechanisms. However, Iraq offers this safe box, which includes targets for a reduction and a rate of 14% less than emissions of greenhouse gases compared to the usual work patterns Knock the temptation. M May 2020 and TY 2035.</p>
<p>The area of ​​concealment consists of two hangings, the first of which is the reduction of 1% of our total emissions in 2035, and the use of the national capabilities available in the achievement of security, security and economic resources. The security of the two hanging, it becomes a reassurance box. 13% of our emissions and emissions capacities have been reduced 2035. To provide the lowest level of prosperity for the Iraqi people, to be implemented when material and technical support is available from the agreement funds and from the international partnerships that we have developed that support Iraq.</p>
<p>This document also completes the lists of strategies to prevent climate change, technical scattered walls, and a technical club, the most vulnerable and most vulnerable to future impact and the greatest impact on the water and food problems for the people, which hinders our ambitions in the field of sustainable development and the development of acquisitions, especially the increase in the number of people and the time of change. The national benefits and the biodiversity, and among us, are impacts on the atomic and social levels, which will contribute to enhancing resilience to the actual and potential impacts of climate change on these areas.</p>
<h2>National conditions</h2>
<p>Iraq is the most vulnerable country to climate change in the Oso East, and it is believed that the future impacts of Iraq are significant on Iraqi society, including Warner, Iraq, and Sinowar. Real and unique challenges as a result of the observed decorations. Technical annual rates of temperature and contrast in the annual rates of the United Arab Emirates and the effects of climate change. From us, Canada, and Nan, the effects of climate change are noticeable publicly on the coastal areas of agriculture and biodiversity due to their structural fragility and the absence of institutional capacity, regulation, and others, the necessary cycles to cope with the effects and reduce risks related to climate change.</p>
<p>From Ranan B. Nechner, the national economic bases suffer from the costs of the technicians&rsquo; adoption. The prevention of the previous Gainer surge and heat cycles has increased, which led to an increase in fluids and electrical power and its effects, and the noticeable decrease in the current levels of electric power available to the Iraqi people, announced that it is now Over the course of the best water decades, Iraq did not provide 24 hours of electricity and electricity to the Iraqi citizen, and that the total electricity supply at the present time is 11,000 megawatts, compared to the actual ban on electricity in the country, and it is 23,000 megawatts in the Kurdistan Region, while it is expected that the heat of the electrodes will increase for the Tunnel 42 , 000 megawatts of Anay 2030. We learned) and the net electric power supplied to the Iraqi fan, and I received a technician in 2013 and 2014 that I received (1,375) kilowatts. hour. One year for each snore, and this is the percentage of technician du Genoir in Anrak Nawali (8,000) kilowatts. Sanaa. Sunna Kanel Shankher.</p>
<p>And the reference to the above, in the field of acquisition and work, shows that the river collapses as a result of the collapse of the river, and the blood of the people is close to the end of 2014. In the elderly and young people, there are three parts of the country, including two cities, from western and southern Iraq, as a result of the international migration of the population and the reason for the displacement of ISIS. Al-Anraaq and Ranad among us are approximately 528,6,01 displaced families inside Iraq, and the number of members of these families has reached 3,181,606 since the month of Cannon. 2nd for May 2014</p>
<p>It is worth noting that despite the population growth in Iraq during the last several successive decades and the increase in the world&rsquo;s emissions of carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> to the joule, but that Iraq&rsquo;s demand for work and the usual patterns was not enough, and the appropriate level of humiliation meets the conditions of Iraqi society, and it was a devotee and formed a way and decreased to levels A comparison of the eggs in the year 1991 and in the year 2002, respectively, and the cause of the wars (Figure (1) shows the fluctuation of the immune activity in Iraq in the years 1960 and 2015)</p>
<p>The field of civil transport in Iraq witnessed a severe deterioration, counting in the year 1991. The number of aircraft m 63 aircraft in the year 1980 m was reduced to two aircraft m Aoqi women (2002) to 84 Awqai women (2014). The decrease in the general transport base is estimated to be 90%, and as a result, the private transport bed and the contractor at nights grew to 80%, which led to the predominance of the growth of mobility: (a car for a passenger and a road) as a result of the security situation and the security and social considerations that affected the Iraqi society and directly.</p>
<p>Although Iraq's emissions are few in response, and they are almost negligible compared to the emissions of other countries in the world, the proportion of their contribution is followed by approximately (0,2%) of the world&rsquo;s global emissions of the buried burials and the United Nations&rsquo;s budgets for the years 1990-2011. However, Iraq knows that the solution to the climate change problem is not to be found in them, as we have achieved through the adoption of the joint security agreements that have been agreed upon and agreed upon by us. The different types are according to the principle of construction, starting in Iraq, and since Buckner&rsquo;s agreement was established to implement the agreement and work on the implementation of projects and strategic studies to introduce the new and renewable resources and the proper management of the evidence for corona and increase the area of ​​​​the wine fields, as have been launched and projects related to the introduction of fuels, petro-gas and conventional fuels as fuels Other pioneering projects are technicians of these geniuses, and many of the national media are working on transforming the lighting of many main streets, technicians and Ghandad for workers, solar channels, and Wena Khano in the future to transform and some of the generation stations.The electricity supply to the composite circuits to reduce the use of fuel and the internet, but the meanings of these projects are a guarantee of our safety and security, as a result of the security threats against the terrorists, the humiliating terrorist attacks and the catastrophic consequences of life and internal threats to all of the society&rsquo;s population. And yes, I am Zainada, the contention, the rebellious conflict, and Iraq&rsquo;s decision to choose a large budget for the liberation of its occupied cities, the liberation of the occupied cities, and the reconstruction of the occupied cities. Financial betrayals, which will negatively affect Iraq&rsquo;s people in achieving the development goals that we are now technically achieving. This is a challenge that draws the energies of the country.Al-Iqtanidia, Al-Aminah, and Al-Bashneriya, a technician betting on terrorism and bastard publicly. The international community should support us with this fierce attack. When it comes to the world, it will not be shared outside of us. By working on organized methodologies for restoring infrastructures that can adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects.</p>

<h2>National contributions to emission mitigation measures:</h2>
<p>Iraq supports the current situation in the participation of countries and their nationally determined contributions in the new agreement, with the need for it to be based on the principle of disclosure and transparency in the presentation and data of greenhouse gases, and the implementation of what each country decided on the rates of reduction in it, the path of reaching the global goal, which is to stabilize the altitude and temperature levels to Madon Alderrty m Whitty. As a result of the game that Iraq is going through, it needs at least 15 years of age and security threats are waiting for the standard and a gradual, real and legalized transformation of the uses of energy and investment in the base of renewable contracts, the sound environmental management of the crown, and the preparation of national strategies and legal legislation that will help implement these policies.</p>
<p>The base line has been raised for the normal work of the amount of usdged in 2020 in order to allow the development of the electricity base for Yemen or Iraqi citizens on the electricity and in a continuous form in the field of electricity.

<h2>Adaptation Procedures:</h2>
<p>The spring sleep in Iraq and which depends on its navigator, Darlin and Al-Farrat, whose age is fundamental and technical, the stability of the climate of Iraq and the world, especially in the last ten years, but this sleep has stripped many of the drowsiness over the extent of the faults represented and leveled the administration and successive wars and climatic changes that exacerbated it and increased its capabilities. on sustainability.</p>
<p>Tamm or Iraq on the Inter-Al-Mainaa, M. Al-Maqoura, where there is a new pressure factor, which is a major pressure factor for the Iraqi citizen, and the other, the food neighbours, on the direct impact of the Iraqi economy, with a threatening effect on the interests of God, with interests consistent with the difficulties, for Iraq is sparing effort in To play a positive dharram in this delusional turmoil, especially. His civilian sovereignty constitutes a violation of the right of Iraqis to a decent life in the midst of the city</p>
<p>Forecasts based on national numerical climatic models indicate an increase of volatility ranging from 0.9 m from the year 2007 to 3,5 water cycles at 2100 C, which increases the bitterness of the site in Lund, the temperature increased to (50) water cycles for several days in this year, not to mention the contrast, where the rates are 2100 technicians 30% of the annual temperature, which is expected If we see their quantities, we will increase their numbers according to the general conditions of the air forces and the Iraqi seismic monitoring, their rates during the period 1938-1978, and their frequency is increased. Such as the dry heat and the heavy avalanche, and their recurrence, which led to an increase in the area of ​​intercourse, which increased the gains of Al-Ghabnar and Al-Ghabarina Al-Awsat, Khan Al-Sunnah, which led to a noticeable increase in the number of irrigating machines in the Iraqi society, especially children and the elderly, and the spread of diseases and cancers, in a noticeable way in recent years.</p>
<p>However, climate change has exacerbated the problem of water scarcity in Nahrel Darla and Euphrates, where the World Bank estimates for the year 2011 indicate a shortage and scarcity of renewable water resources compared to the actual year during the period from 2000 to 2009 following to 16%, and it is expected that Next, this percentage will reach 38% during the period AD 2020 until 2020, which will subsequently increase to 51% during the period AD 2040 until 2050. The spring sleep came under the threshold and brought about a real and unprecedented change in this sleep and the loss of the economic services that they provide to the local population and species, as well as the extinction of endemic species, the dominance of invasive and exotic species, the displacement of species and the direction of the north, with the demographic change of the regions and the migration of the population from these regions.Moreover, climate change threatens the marine coastal areas of the Gulf, especially in the Al-Barah neighborhood, where the Iraqi narrator Why not this, not to mention, the effects on the realms of agriculture, agriculture, accommodation, and catering to the poor, to stabilize the country and raise awareness of the achievement of sustainable development in the national economy and threaten security and all vital sectors.</p>
<p>This report provides the basis for the building blocks for a future vision for Iraq in the field of adaptation, which will represent the minimum flexibility to avoid the actual and potential impacts of climate change, especially for those who relate to and reduce the imminent risks and fragile barriers, as well as the inward gaps, which represent a cornerstone for achieving sustainable development. The direct vision challenges and the preparation of a national strategy for adaptation with an executive branch that focuses on finding quick means to sustain the water resources and treat the severe water scarcity and degrade its quality, in order to avoid the rivers and dangerous dangers emerging from Al-Jifna, the most important of which is the water scarcity and its effects on the water and food exchanges and the movement of food and water. Al-Ramlina and Al-Anas Al-Azbarina and their biorelics and the deterioration of the natural habitats.</p>
<p>And a fire for the synergistic relationship in the halls in the preparation and implementation of the strategy, the workspace, and the enabling strategies, but the content of the main halls affected by climate change and within the framework of national strategies and the relevant platform. The national work for the integrated management of biological risks and the executive function in Iraq for the period 2012 (2012) Al-Jifna Al-Anarat technician will make me believe that I will strengthen the national capacity for the current and potential climate change Maronites on the different halls, especially those halls that are most basic and exposed to contamination, as follows:</p>
<h2>Adaptation measures required for the water sector in Iraq:</h2>
<p>1- Rehabilitation of the Mosul Dam to ensure its stability, expansion of the Vietnamese smuggler and Al-Thartnar canal, the technician of the front of the sinamarat dam, and the restoration of the irrigation canal and the preserve on the seats of the Darla River inside the city of Ghandad, and the ends of the main buildings are considered the most important civil engineering projects. We will snipe this project for 11 billion dollars. Our technicians have the capacity to rehabilitate the Musanl dam, the art of the dams, where they are the anchors of Sanad, and Nadush to work on the safe harbor of the Masnawi port, for those of us who store the Musanl bond, and here is the strategic study of the port&rsquo;s resources and the Aryans are the technicians of Al-Anraq (2014).</p>
<p>2- Introducing the possible methods (spraying and purification) in all areas of the country, which is a nickel of 45,543 billion dollars over the next twenty years. Irrigation to the red areas and the mother's food infestation.</p>
<p>3- Nazem Al-Tharthar Al-Faymani and the Maqdi canal, Samrat dam, expanded to accommodate 13500 y3/s and studied the Al-Warrar Canal and Al-Majarah Canal..</p>
<p>4- Qanaa 6.4 increased at the port&rsquo;s treatment facilities, so that you would be ready to be equipped with a million cubic meters of water from the port.</p>
<p>5- Improving and expanding the port&rsquo;s network, and verifying the tapping of a technician&rsquo;s shafts for the distribution and expansion network, and we will use the counters to monitor consumption.</p>
<p>6- Expanding the number of facilities for the treatment of land in the country in the year 2035. These facilities will be able to treat 2,078 billion <sup>3</sup> of the port, but every year we will be brought back to the rivers, and this project will simultaneously prevent the deterioration of the industrial halls to increase their potential for water reuse and the percentage of water use. 25% T, which will cost more than 80 billion dollars.</p>
<p>7- Improvement and monitoring of water quality, supplied by the technician of the Ministry of Water Resources, from Khan Tasni&rsquo; to the sampling tanks to reach the Upper and Lower Zab, Al-A&rsquo;im and Diyala rivers.</p>
<p>8-Tal Hill, the major projects in Iraq, and he narrated them gradually, and the main dumps or evaporation yards, and they were returned to the rivers and fresh water drains.</p>
<p>9- The construction of a block on what the Arabs, the introduction of the FAO ports in the Uday Al-Tamkem machine, to maintain a water flow of no less than 50 cubic meters, and the second from its port.</p>
<p>10- Al-Hara for more studies to assess the appropriateness of continuity and use of groundwater, as well as studies and research programs to study the groundwater recharge areas to assist the technicians to restore the groundwater stocks and improve the rivers to withdraw the levels of water and water in 2035. The maximum sustainable withdrawal of groundwater will be up to 5, 243 billion <sup>y3</sup> t, which represents 8.8% of the available fresh water resources at that time.</p>
<p>11- Dams have been established in the region of the Kurdistan Region, because its topography is not secure, and when it relies on collecting its harbors, it is technically in the diaspora, because the Kurdistan Region is located in the areas supplied by the Emirates, and work is done on a number of projects, whose size exceeds 100,0, except in <sup>2</sup> , especially the residential projects Raise the bottom of these pots as a reservoir to collect rainwater for use in watering gardens and for washing.</p>
<p>12- Reuse of basal water for various halls, and that is:</p>
<p>- The use in the construction of the winery crisis to reduce the phenomenon of conflict, especially. It is believed that the high seas would collect about 3.474 billion <sup>3</sup> billion cubic meters of rice water per year, coming in 2035, and this amount would provide a sufficient reservoir of enamel to support the tenements of the wineries. Al-Anrak (the estimated flow of water currents reaches 5,313 billion y3 <sup>/</sup> year).</p>
<p>- Its use in reviving the marshes, including the Hammar Marsh and the humiliation, and it is possible to receive from us about 0.42 million cubic meters per year of high map water.</p>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong> All of the above are for private projects. This is a preliminary estimate, and it is subject to changes in the local and international market pricing technician.</p>
<h2>The potential risks:</h2>
<p>1- The projects that do not provide the economic resources to implement our projects, as this will result in a loss of agricultural production technicians to reach more than 2 million dunums, which means a decrease in agricultural production and a percentage of 20% over the next ten years.</p>
<p>2- If the Mosul Dam has not been revitalized, Iraq will have a large supply of water, and it will not be possible to achieve the goals of 2035 in the various halls, including the generation of power.</p>
<h2>Urgent issues for the water resources sector in Iraq:</h2>
<p>1- The need to reach agreements with the neighboring countries that share with Iraq from the public arnel of Iraq, in terms of water and suitable quality for different uses. Al-Dunya can not be thankful for all Iraqi sculptors.</p>
<p>2- The availability of financial resources to implement the aforementioned projects and the strategic study of their importance.</p>
<p>3- He will not be able to do so, because this is because the examinations for the syphilis ensure the minimum flow of the examinations for IVF and no blood outlets, so it will be challenging and clear in this area.</p>
<h2>Adaptation measures required for the agricultural sector:</h2>
<p>Farmers and farmers consider the effects of climate change on agriculture, and this dispersal and the result is publicly reflected in the provision of food to all the population as a result of the decline in agricultural plant and animal production, and the benefits and benefits that it considers are rare. It will be prevented as a result of the decline of Dakhnal Al-Muzari, migration from irrigation to the city and other influences.</p>
<p>A- Despite some of the decisions taken by the Iraqi government, which can be considered as strategies to prevent climatic changes, such as attempts to use modern irrigation methods, establishment of natural pasture areas, projects to install sand dunes, and the installation of desert colors, based on the public port of the underground port and agricultural monitors. To make more of the technical fertilizers to improve the management of marine agriculture and the use of complementary networks, to improve as the agricultural technicians, the technicians of the marine agriculture, to develop crops that are drought tolerant and resistant to pollution, to establish plants that monitor and raise water alarms, for the purposes of seedlings, for the purposes of increasing the capacity of water crops for the purposes of seedlings. The technicians of pastoral areas, especially the technicians of Badinah, used the methods of integrated control of agricultural techniques and the approval of the publicOur smoke and produce are plants that are resistant to diseases and adapted to climatic changes Working on the adaptation of livestock chains that are adaptive Preventing climate changes and resistant to diseases and having high outbreaks and promotion of health risks and studies and special methods of climate and climate changes and outbreaks of changes in agriculture and cities.</p>
<h2>Adaptation actions required for the biodiversity sector:</h2>
<p>Iraq started in Reda and the Al-Nanam protection center was announced, or a natural preserve, the technician of the rivers, Al-Wasnai, Anai 2013. Likewise, the artists of the rivers have been nominated, and I am an artist, I have shown them, I have shown them, I have seen them, I have seen the artists, the artists, from the UNESCO, to be a world natural heritage site, so there is a concerted work of art in the Kurdistan Region to protect the ghats in Al-Jaba or Al-Jaba and the Iraqi diversity. Spring and ironing a network of natural protected areas throughout the country until 2035.</p>
<p>I would like to focus on a group of adaptive cycles to enhance the distribution of natural reserves, including the exchange of rivers and the provision of national efforts towards strategies to increase the resilience of the comprehensive biodiversity in order to avoid climate change and various activities, including:</p>
<p>1. Control or eliminate threats to biological diversity and natural/growing ecological species.</p>
<p>2. Establishment of a network of reserves with channels that provide migration paths and the spread of animals and plants, as well as the death of local extinctions. Our embrace is complied with international agreements, including the Biolnorary Diversity Agreement and Otoko Kartarneh, declaring approximately 15 national reserves until the end of 2020, which is 17% of India&rsquo;s share of the agreement. The overall contribution to Iraq.</p>
<p>3. To increase the flexibility of new protected areas when they are established, it is important to achieve a set of parameters such as:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Preservation of spring plant targets through clear streams (such as trout and trout treads, etc.)</li>
<li>Establishing buffer zones and natural reserves</li>
<li>Reducing Habitat Fragmentation and Insomnia Won</li>
<li>Preserving the genetic diversity of yum and wei numbers of local species</li>
<li>Develop and implement a framework law that takes care of feral life (animals and plants) for rivers and fisheries, as well as the protection and trading of natural resources, while specifying the seasons and methods of implementing these activities.</li>
<li>So we succumbed to some of the warnings and punishments concerned, and smoked the luminous species and the ignited species (including the invasive species) to the spring night.</li>
<li>Editing the relevant national legislative framework and reserves to focus on the growth of political activity.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Health sector:</h2>
<p>Undoubtedly, there is no doubt that climate change will affect the situation in Iraq, which will increase the number of deaths and diseases, and some diseases that can be transmitted, in the port and in contaminated foods, including some of the transmissible diseases such as cholera, marina, typhoid and security, and Gainer&rsquo;s diseases such as infection, respiratory diseases, nutritional allergies and heart diseases.The effects of climate change on the environment depend on many factors, including the age of the public sector, society, behavior, the animals, the economic status of the individual, and Rome, the emergence of unusual urticaria resulting from high temperatures and unprecedented aura and at other than the usual times, which may stimulate types of insects that transmit diseases O.T. microbes or the Marinian virus that changes the growth and cycle of one of us who spreads it, we will spread it openly in the public sector and the human being. Either this case is a beacon in the search for other means, it will change its growth and its cycle. The population policy and exposure to the effects of climate change</p>
<p>The Iraqi government, from Khan al-Adend, from Khanu and Banaramen, sought to expand the district care services, and the Ministry of Endea The basic life care for all citizens is free of charge as a basic pillar, and the provision of living services is completed according to the standards of military service, considering them the level of the servicemen or the subordinate to those who are in charge of the integration of the services. Technician live centers and work and Nai live visitor.</p>
<h2>Adaptation measures required for the health sector:</h2>
<p>In spite of the foregoing, there are rumors and patriotism, but there is still a composer, a composer, and a woman who helps the selected neighborhood parties in Iraq to prepare and hide the negative influences that may increase the number of living conditions, and that is through the promotion of the local people and the services of the public sector and their education Drinking clean water for various populations, areas of Toland, mosquitoes and other insects, for transmitters of diseases, preparation of studies, various services for neighborhoods and improvement of the infrastructure here to reduce security. Diseases that need to be exacerbated, prevention of climate change is an achievement and in order to monitor the outbreak of infectious diseases and focus on living awareness.</p>
<h2>Sea level rise and the tourism sector:</h2>
<p>Despite the Iraqi question about Al-Kheleen, many studies have indicated that we hope for significant impacts as a result of the sea level rise on the Iraqi territories, especially the threatened, drowning and bastard of Iraq. Vener concentrates a lot of agricultural areas, the palm trees, and the oil fields, the industrial facilities and the undisclosed technical sources. Al-Saaliya is not specifically mentioned, not to mention the effect of the high temperature and fever of the port of Al-Bahn on the chlorinated rivers of the Bahraini people and their emigration from the waters of the rivers and the monitoring of the regional ports of Anrak, and the impact of these two sea conditions on the sea. And the sea, which enumerates the number of political areas visited by tourists annually and in large numbers. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the sea generate great impacts on Iraq, and agricultural, industrial, and political trends, and migration toIts impact on the waste wealth of Iraq, which makes it necessary for the international community to speculate and adapt to this problem.</p>
<h2>Required adaptation actions:</h2>
<p>And the opposition, the strategic strategic strategies, the dragon, and the legalization of the Nindolian society, meant us for adopting them from the stubbornness of a national strategy of tactics and for implementing it. One of the focus now on the religious and alternative historical traditions as a resource for the religious and the content of our history. Al-Aqandi Al-Anwar and the places are fascinated by us and the use of them for this purpose, not to mention the Warnad of the holy shrines frequented by the first pilgrims during religious occasions.Also, there was no stubbornness about the Sunni areas, the technician of the installation of industrial facilities, as much as possible, in anticipation of this channel, and the effort that brought attention to the studies and research in this field, and the establishment of academic studies and the support of the Alanoui Al-Bahnar Center. This space.</p>
<h2>Principles to be adhered to:</h2>
<p>In addition to what you offer and to facilitate the contribution of all parties to the new agreement and to share with the world the anxiety of the villain who is living from the rings of increasing emissions, rising global temperatures and the exacerbation of the problem of climate change, and for all parties to be part of the solution. Or a binding legal formula and the shilling of climate change, and that these principles are an integral part of this agreement, as follows:</p>
<p>1- Emphasis on the voluntaryness of these contributions and the promise of the developing countries, especially the most vulnerable and the least emissions, and that the new agreement does not satisfy the technicians of the new agreement, and that they provide a proportional support to them in order to prevent the reduction of their emissions, the amount of their fragility, the scattering of their bases and climate change.</p>
<p>2- That the framework agreement and the decisions of the conferences of the frameworks are the basis for the new agreement, including the principle of common and differentiated responsibilities according to national capabilities, funds, and historical responsibilities. And the anointing of Kanankoun and others, because it represents our legacy, we agreed on our nation, our history, and our nation&rsquo;s pledge to one of those who preserved it and benefited from it.</p>
<p>3- The increase of developed countries and the reduction of their emissions and raising the level of the emissions in this reduction to bridge the gap and the actual reality of these emissions and the international community to work to stabilize the rise in the global temperature to below 2 water degrees.</p>
<p>4- That the new agreement completes the six elements of the agreement (technologies, mitigation, support or provision, transfer, enlightenment, and entrusting of technologies, capabilities, transparency in decisions)</p>
<p>5- To host the advanced seminars and support the developing ones (especially ours with the lowest emissions and the largest) technicians in the techniques of air conditioning, technology transfer and capabilities to enable them to confront their problems due to the impact of climate change on them and facilitate the implementation of their programs in adaptation and disguise.</p>
<p>6- That the developed countries and the financing of the mechanisms and funds of the agreement and the facilitation of the countries that continue to this financing and that they be more reactive in implementing their promises and financing the Green Climate Fund and the amount of 100 billion US dollars annually until the year 2020 to support developing countries, especially the recurrent and the most vulnerable ones.</p>
<p>7- It is not permissible for the municipality of the framework agreement or the stubbornness to interpret it, formulate it or restructure it.</p>
<p>8- That there should be an international effort to identify effective mechanisms to assist the developing countries referred to, and we have discussed the last of them to counteract the effects of the response cycles taken by the developed countries and focus on the fragile ones to diversify their sources of economy.</p>
<p>9- That there should be exceptional support for Iraq in the current conditions that our people are experiencing, and that it is fighting a crisis against terrorism, on all sides, which has contributed to the shedding of the blood of the people and the security of the people, and the destruction of the infrastructure for many years. It is worth mentioning that Iraq has been exposed to malaminah for many years, and we will see the fires that have been exposed to illumination.</p>
<p>10- That the work continues and the mechanisms of support that are approved or that restrict the decision and facilitate the financing that we finance in order to speed up the sponsorship for it and speed up the completion of projects to counter climate change and its effects.</p>
