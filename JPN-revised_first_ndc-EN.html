  <h1>Japan’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)</h1>
  <p>Japan’s Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Target</p>
  <p>Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46 percent in fiscal year 2030 from its fiscal year 2013 levels, setting an ambitious target which is aligned with the long- term goal of achieving net-zero by 2050. Furthermore, Japan will continue strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its emission by 50 percent.</p>

        <p>Japan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero, that is, to realize carbon neutrality by 2050, based on the idea that addressing climate change is no longer a constraint on economic growth and that proactive climate change measures bring transformation of industrial structures as well as its economy and society, leading to dynamic economic growth. By the Act Partially Amending the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures (Act No. 54 of 2021) which was enacted in 204th session of the Diet, net-zero by 2050 became a Basic Principle of the Act. The legislative amendment will enhance the continuity and predictability of policies and accelerate efforts and investments as well as innovation for decarbonization towards not only the achievement of the mid-term target, but also the realization of a decarbonized society.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46 percent in fiscal year 2030 from its fiscal year 2013 levels, setting an ambitious target which is aligned with the long- term goal of achieving net-zero by 2050. Furthermore, Japan will continue strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its emissions by 50 percent. In order to create a virtuous cycle of the economy and the environment and to realize robust growth toward its ambitious goal for fiscal year 2030, Japan will put forward all possible efforts in all areas including by thorough energy efficiency measures, maximum introduction of renewable energy, as well as decarbonization of public sectors and local communities. In food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries industries, based on the “Strategy for Sustainable Food Systems, MeaDRI (Measures for achievement of Decarbonization and Resilience with Innovation) (decided by Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on May 12th, 2021),” Japan aims to enhance productivity potentials and ensure sustainability in a compatible manner through innovation. Based on the “MLIT’s Green Challenge (decided by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism on July 6th, 2021),” Japan will steadily carry out efforts in cross-sectoral decarbonization in national land, urban and regional spheres. Japan will create new industries and jobs by proceeding efforts in strategic transitions to a circular economy, which is necessary for decarbonization, as well as through nature-based solutions (NbS).</p>
        <p>Japan will continue its strenuous efforts towards 2030, and further towards 2050. Realizing carbon-neutrality by 2050 and cutting emissions by 46 percent in fiscal year 2030 is certainly not an easy task; it is therefore essential to position decarbonization as one of the main issues in all socio-economic activities and to bring forward the transformation into sustainable and resilient socio-economic systems. For those targets to be achieved, Japan will promote policies contributing to growth by holding decarbonization as its pillar.</p>
        <p>As already mentioned in (a) (i), specific examinations were conducted in a manner open to the public, at the joint meetings of the Mid- and Long-Term Climate Change Countermeasures Subcommittee of the Global Environment Committee under the Central Environment Council and the Working Group for Consideration of Global Warming Countermeasure of the Global Environment Subcommittee of the Committee on industrial Science and Technology Policy and Environment under the Industrial Structural Council, as well as at the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy.</p>
        <p>On July 17th, 2015, Japan submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat. Following that, on May 13th, 2016, Japan made a Cabinet Decision on the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures. Every year since the formulation of the plan, the Global Warming Prevention Headquarters, led by the Prime Minister with all Cabinet Ministers as its members, has made rigorous reviews and examinations on, among others, the state of progress in each countermeasure taken by the Government, by using the outcome in emission reductions including figures by greenhouse gases and other classifications, and indicators to evaluate the progress in implementing countermeasures.</p>
        <p>Specifically, by administering evaluations on each section of measures and policies and identifying sections whose progress is delayed, the Government conducted examinations on, among others, how to improve progress in the identified sections. In so doing, the Government considered not only the enhancement of measures and policies that are already included in the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures but also the introduction of new measures and policies.</p>
        <p>Also, with regard to the new target for fiscal year 2030, the Government will continue progress management in a similar manner as mentioned in the above.</p>

        <p>Japan will establish and implement the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) in order to quantitatively evaluate contributions of Japan to greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals which are achieved through the diffusion of, among others, leading decarbonizing technologies, products, systems, services, and infrastructures as well as through the implementation of measures in developing countries and others, and in order to use such contributions to achieve Japan’s NDC. By doing so, through public-private collaborations, Japan aims to secure accumulated emission reductions and removals at the level of approximately 100 million t-CO2 by fiscal year 2030. Japan will appropriately count the acquired credits to achieve its NDC.</p>
        <p>With regards to the JCM which Japan has initiated to establish, Japan secures environmental integrity and the avoidance of double-counting in line with the international rules including the Paris Agreement. Also, based on its experience in the JCM, Japan intends to lead international discussions, thereby contributing to the development of appropriate international rules for the use of market mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Japan will also make proactive efforts in the area of international cooperation to promote decarbonization and to improve resilience in developing countries and others, including from developing policies and institutional platforms to promoting sector- and city-level efforts as well as facilitating technology diffusion.</p>

      <td>
        <p>Set as an ambitious target which is aligned with the long-term goal of achieving net-zero by 2050, Japan’s new goal will certainly not be an easy task as Japan would raise its previous target by over 70 percent. Nonetheless, as a nation which underpins manufacturing in the world, Japan is ready to demonstrate its leadership for world-wide decarbonization by defining a top-level ambitious target befitting to a next growth strategy.</p>
        <p>In promoting implementation of global warming countermeasures, Japan aims to advance policy measures to contribute to integrated improvement in environment, economy and society, by utilizing local resources, technological innovation and ingenuity, which could also provide solutions for challenges including economic vitalization, job creation and region-specific problems in the country.</p>
        <p>In light of the recognition that we are living in a major turning point of the era, what is required is not to simply return to the world before the COVID-19 pandemic, but to realize a transformation to a sustainable and resilient social system. Based on the declaration for net-zero by 2050, Japan will strongly promote the “re-design” of its economy and society to make it sustainable and resilient, through accelerating the three types of transitions, namely towards “a decarbonized society,” “a circular economy” and “a decentralized society.”</p>
