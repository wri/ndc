# REPUBLIC OF TURKEY 

 

## INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 

 

 
 
In accordance with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, the Republic of Turkey hereby presents its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) towards achieving the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which is set out in its Article 2 and clarifying information. 
 
 
### National Circumstances 
 
Turkey achieved 230 per cent increase in GDP between 1990 and 2012. Its population has increased more than 30 per cent since 1990. Turkey's energy demand increases by 6-7 percent every year. 

Turkey is an upper-middle income developing country according to the World Bank classification. Turkey remains eligible to official development assistance (ODA). 

Turkey is listed in Annex I to the UNFCCC. However, Decision 1/CP.16 recognized the special circumstances of Turkey and placed Turkey in a different situation than the other Parties included in Annex I. 

Turkey aims to contribute to the collective efforts to combat climate change in line with its national circumstances and capabilities. 

With this perspective, National Strategy on Climate Change and National Climate Change Action Plan were adopted in 2010 and 2011 respectively. 

National Climate Change Action Plan consists of emission control and adaptation policies and measures which are being implemented in all relevant sectors. 

The greenhouse gas inventory of the year 2012 revealed that the total emissions in 2012 expressed in CO2 equivalent were 440 million tons in Turkey. The energy sector had the largest share with 70.2 percent. Industrial processes with 14.3 percent, waste sector with 8.2 percent and agriculture with 7.3 percent followed the energy sector. Turkey's per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for the same year was 5.9 ton CO2 equivalent, which is much lower than the EU and OECD average. 

 

### Information on INDC 
 

#### INDC 

**Up to 21 percent reduction in GHG emissions from the Business as Usual (BAU) level by 2030.**

#### Period for Implementation or Contribution 

2021-2030 

#### Scope and Coverage 

Economy-wide. 
Energy,  industrial  processes  and  products  use,  agriculture,  land  use  
land-use change and forestry, and waste sectors. 
#### GHGs 
All greenhouse gases included in the national inventory:  
*  Carbon dioxide (СО2);  
*  Methane (СН4);  
*  Nitrous oxide (N2O);  
*  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); 
*  Perfluorocarbons (PFCs);  
*  Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6); 
*  Nitrous trifluoride (NF3). 

#### Methodological approaches 

Methodological  approaches  are  based  on  using  the  IPCC  2006 Guidelines and IPCC 2013 KP Supplement.
Global  warming potential  on a 100  year timescale in  accordance with the IPCC's 4th Assessment Report. 

#### Use of International Market Mechanisms 
Turkey aims to use carbon credits from international market mechanisms to achieve its 2030 mitigation target in a cost effective manner and in accordance with the relevant rules and standards. 
#### Consideration of fairness and ambition based on national conditions 
Turkey has to continue its sustainable development process. 
Rapid  industrialization  and  urbanization  have  been  taking  place  in Turkey over the last 30 years. 
Turkey is responsible for only 0.7 percent of the global emissions since the industrial revolution.  
Energy  imports  have  a  significant  share  in  Turkey's  account  deficit. Turkey has to use its limited energy resources. 
Turkey  experiences financial  and technological  constraints in combating climate change. 
This  INDC  provides  additional  policies,  plans  and  measures  in  many sectors. 
#### How the INDC contributes to achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention (Article 2) 
Up to 21 percent reduction in GHG emissions from the BAU level by 2030 will enable Turkey to step on low-carbon development pathways compatible with the long-term objective of limiting the increase in global temperature below 2°C. 

#### Planning Process 



**Turkey  may  revise  this  INDC  in  accordance  with  changing circumstances.**
Turkey  supports  its  INDC  through  a  national  climate  change  policy which includes; 
-  10th National Development Plan 
-  National Strategy on Climate Change 
-  National Climate Change Action Plan 
-  National Strategy on Industry 
-  Strategy on Energy Efficiency 
-  National Strategy and Action Plan on Recycling 
-  National Legislation on Monitoring, Reporting and Verification of GHG emissions 
-  National  Smart  Transportation  Systems  Strategy  Document  (2014-2023) and its Action Plan (2014-2016) 

Turkey's INDC was prepared in a participatory approach through multiple stakeholder meetings and by analytical studies conducted for 1 year. 
Times-MACRO model is used for energy related modeling and other national models and studies are used for non-energy sectors. 

#### Financial Needs 
Recalling the decisions 26/CP.7, 1/CP.16, 2/CP.17, 1/CP.18 and 21/CP.20, in view of successfully implementing this INDC, Turkey will use domestic sources and receive international financial, technological, technical and capacity building support, including finance from the Green Climate Fund. 

 
 
 
### Plans and policies to be implemented for this INDC
