# Intended	 Nationally	 Determined	 Contribution	 	 

# November	 2015	 

### 1. Introduction	 

The Republic of Palau is committed to the successful conclusion of negotiations under the Ad‐Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) in order to adopt, at COP21, a new legally‐binding agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) applicable to all Parties, to come into effect in 2020.	 	 

In accordance with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, the Republic of Palau is pleased to communicate its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) towards achieving the objective of the UNFCCC, as well as accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency, and understanding of its INDC.	 	 

The Republic of Palau is also pleased to provide additional accompanying information on our mitigation effort and support for implementation.	 

### 2. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution - Mitigation [Contribution] 
**Timeframe**: 
* **Start year**: 2020 
* **End year**:2025

 **Type of commitment:**
* Absolute energy sector emissions reduction target, with additional reductions coming from the waste and transport sectors.

**Reference/base year:**
* Reference/base year is 2005 - emissions were approximated at 88 thousand tCO2e 

**Estimated quantified emissions reductions:**  

  * Indicative targets:
    * 22% energy sector emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2025
    * 45% Renewable Energy target by 2025	  
    * 35% Energy Efficiency target by 2025	 
**Coverage:**	 
* Energy (electricity generation), transport and waste sectors
* Gases: Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and methane (CH4)
 
**Baseline assumption:**	 

  Business	 as	 Usual	 (BAU)	 emissions	 scenario	 projections	 are	 based	 on	  economic	 growth	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 new	 climate	 change	 policies	 and	  measures	 in  addition	 to	 those	 in	 place	 in	 2015,	 and	 greater	 coverage	  and	 implementation	 of	 existing	 measures.	 	 	 

  BAU	 projections	 include	 the	 electricity	 sector	 only,	 which	 is	 Palau's	  largest	 emitting	 sector.	 	 BAU	 assumptions	 include	 a	 GDP	 per	 capita	  growth	 of	 3.72%  per	 year	 (historical	 15	 year	 CAGR)	 and	 EIA	 oil	 price	  projections	 in	 reference	 case	 as	 the	 basis	 for	 residential,	 government	  and	 commercial	 sector	 energy  use	 growth	 projections.	 Commercial	  energy	 use	 growth	 projections	 also	 took	 into	 consideration	 energy	  use	 by	 private	 generators	 in	 the	 tourism	 sector.	 	 	 

  Emission	 from	 the	 waste	 management	 and	 transport	 sectors	 are	 not	  included	 in	 the	 BAU	 projection	 however	 emission	 reduction	  initiatives	 will	 be	 addressed  on	 a	 project	 basis.	 
  
**Intention to use market-based mechanisms to meet target:**
  * No	 

**Land sector accounting approach:**
* N/A

**Planning Process:** 
* Palau's	 INDC	 is	 grounded	 in	 the	 Palau	 Climate	 Change	 Policy,	 which	  was	 informed by input from communities, civil society and other stakeholders, as	 well	 as	 on  the	 preparatory	 work	 for	 Palau's	 second	  National	 Communication	 which	 was	 also	 widely	 consulted.	 	 

  The	 Policy	 establishes	 Palau's	 National	 Appropriate	 Mitigation	  Actions	 (NAMA)	 and	 National	 Adaptation	 Plan	 (NAP)	 as	 well	 as	 the	  institutional	 and	 policy  frameworks	 for:	 (a)	 climate	 change	  mitigation	 via	 management	 of	 greenhouse	 gas	 emissions	 including	  carbon	 sinks;	 and	 (b)	 climate	 change	 adaptation	 and  risk	 reduction	  and	 management.	 It	 establishes	 the	 policy	 framework	 that	 will	 guide	  and	 inform	 action	 in	 accordance	 with	 Palau's	 *National	 Master	  Development	 Plan	 -	 Palau	 2020.*	 	 	 

  
  **Fair and Ambitious**:
  * The	 Republic	 of	 Palau's	 total	 emissions	 are	 de	 minimis	 in	 the	 global	  context.	 	 Given	 Palau's	 remoteness,	 the	 small	 size	 of	 the	 economy,	  low	 GDP	 per  capita,	 dependence	 on	 partnership	 support	 and	  vulnerability	 to	 climate	 change,	 Palau's	 proposed	 targets	 are	  ambitious	 and	 fair	 as	 measured	 against	 other  nations.	 	 	 

    Under	 the	 BAU	 scenario	 emissions	 would	 be	 140	 thousand	 tCO2e	 in	  2025,	 compared	 to	 68	 thousand	 tCO2e	 if	 both	 the	 renewable	 energy	  and	 energy  efficiency	 targets	 are	 met.	 	 	 
    
    Emissions	 in	 2005	 were	 approximated	 at	 88	 thousand	 tCO2e.	  Full	 implementation	 of	 the	 renewable	 energy	 and	 energy	 efficiency	  strategies	 outlined	 below  puts	 Palau	 on	 a	 trajectory	 to	 reducing	  emissions	 by	 half	 as	 against	 BAU	 in	 2025,	 the	 equivalent	 of	 22%	  under	 2005	 emissions	 levels.

### 3. Accompanying	 Information	 on	 Palau's	 INDC	 	 
 
#### **a. General	 information	 on	 Palau**	 

Palau is joining the community of nations, both industrialised and developing, in taking action to address the causes and impacts of climate change. Palau is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, principally from sea level rise and the increase in extreme events (drought, flooding, Category 4 and 5 typhoons). Sea-level rise threatens vital infrastructure, settlements, and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities. Moreover, under most climate change scenarios, water resources in small islands are likely to be seriously compromised. Subsistence and commercial agriculture will be adversely affected by climate change, and ocean warming and acidification will heavily impact coral reefs, fisheries, and other marine-based resources crucial to our livelihoods, economy and culture.

#### **b. Mitigation:	 Current	 and	 Future	 Policies	 and	 Measures	 to	 achieve	 INDC	 targets**	 	 

**i. Current	 Policies	 and	 Measures**	 

  Currently	 Palau	 is	 working	 to	 increase	 the	 share	 of	 renewables	 in	 our	 energy	 mix	 and	 to	  increase	 energy	 efficiency	 initiatives.	 To	 date,	 total	 renewable  energy	 efforts	 have	 only	  reached	 8%	 of	 the	 needed	 22%,	 principally	 because	 two	 grid-connected	 solar	 projects	 (1.5	  and	 3.5MW	 respectively)	 never	 came	 to  fruition.	 	 However	 to	 date	 Palau	 has	 achieved	 an	  approximately	 30%	 reduction	 in	 energy	 use	 due	 to	 efficiency	 measures	 taken.	 	 	 

  Current	 renewable	 energy	 and	 energy	 efficiency	 policies	 and	 measures	 include:	 	 a	 pilot	 loan	  subsidy	 for	 solar	 roof	 panels	 which	 will	 be	 increased	 to	 cover  more	 homes	 if	 successful;	 a	  Home	 Energy	 Efficiency	 Program	 at	 the	 Palau	 National	 Development	 Bank;	 prepaid	 metering	  at	 Palau	 Public	 Utilities  Corporation;	 distribution	 of	 CFL	 light	 bulbs;	 government	 building	  retrofits;	 and,	 a	 pilot	 Energy	 Audit	 program	 for	 large	 commercial	 buildings.	 

**ii. Future	 Policies	 and	 Measures	 to	 achieve	 INDC	 target**	 

  To	 achieve	 the	 renewable	 energy	 target	 Palau	 will	 need	 considerable	 additional	 installed	  capacity,	 including	 the	 5MW	 of	 solar	 already	 planned	 (two	 or	 more  solar	 projects	 plus	  additional	 roof-top	 solar)	 plus	 an	 additional	 10	 MW	 to	 power	 the	 water	 sector.	 	 Palau	 will	  also	 have	 to	 work	 to	 reduce	 transmission  and	 distribution	 losses.	 	 (Solar	 Capacity	 Factor	 is	  assumed	 to	 be	 15.3%.)	 

  To	 implement	 the	 Energy	 Efficiency	 target,	 Palau	 will:	 	 
* Increase	 the	 Energy	 Retrofit	 Program;
* Institute	 a	 Tropical	 EE	 Building	 Code;	 
* Adopt	 the	 Energy	 Star	 Appliance	 Standard;	  
* Implement	 an	 Energy	 Labeling	 Scheme;	  
* Significantly	 expand	 our	 Cool	 Roof	 Program;	  
* Expand	 Energy	 Audit	 program	 to	 include	 all	 government	 and	 non-government	  buildings;	  
* Enhance	 the	 Building	 Managers	 Working	 Group;	 and	  
* Improve	 Wastewater	 Infrastructure.	 

Many	 of	 these	 renewable	 energy	 and	 energy	 efficiency	 initiatives	 will	 depend	 on	 the	  availability	 of	 partnership	 finance	 and	 technology	 support.	 

**i. Additional	 project	 based	 initiatives	 in	 the	 transport	 and	 waste	 sectors**	 

  *Reducing	 Methane	 Emissions	 from	 the	 Solid	 Waste	 Sector* 
* Palau	 has	 developed	 a	 "National	 Solid	 Waste	 Framework"	 but	 has	 not	 had	 funding	 to	 implement	 the	 planned	 actions.	 	 A	 key	 next	 step	 is	 to	 analyze	 landfill	 gas	  emissions	 and	 evaluate	 the	 potential	 for	 landfill	 gas	 capture	 projects	 at	 the  national	  landfill	 site.	 

*Transport	 Sector* 
* Currently	 there	 is	 a	 pending	 national	 legislation	 that	 would	 mandate	 the	 use	 and	  commercial	 sale	 of	 four	 stroke	 outboard	 motor	 engines	 only	 to	 reduce  emissions.	 
* Palau	 is	 investigating	 a	 project	 to	 convert	 waste	 cooking	 oil	 to	 biofuel	 for	 diesel	  vehicles,	 beginning	 with	 public	 school	 buses	 and	 a	 potential	 public	 bus  route.	 	 	 

#### **c. Support	 for	 Implementation**	 	 

  Climate	 change	 presents	 a	 major	 challenge	 for	 Palau's	 sustainable	 development,	 for	 which	  the	 nation	 relies	 significantly	 on	 development	 partnerships.	   Similarly,	 as	 noted	 above,	  implementation	 of	 many	 of	 the	 policies	 and	 measures	 needed	 to	 achieve	 our	 emissions	  reduction	 target	 will	 depend	 on	 the  availability	 of	 partnership	 finance,	 technology	 support	  and	 capacity	 development.	 

  Based	 on	 a	 first‐order	 estimate,	 the	 upfront	 investment	 cost	 for	 the	 renewable	 energy	 and	  energy	 efficiency	 measures	 in	 Palau's	 INDC	 would	 be	 on	 the  order	 of	 $5.5	 million	 USD.	 	 This	  investment	 has	 the	 potential	 to	 generate	 savings,	 on	 a	 net-present-value	 basis,	 of	 $2.5	  million	 by	 2025.	 	 This	 figure  doesn't	 show	 the	 full	 picture	 of	 potential	 returns	 on	 investment	  though,	 as	 there	 was	 not	 sufficient	 data	 to	 assess	 the	 energy	 efficiency	 savings	 which	 have	  the	 potential	 to	 be	 substantial.
