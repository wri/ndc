<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p>
<p>Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are at the core of the Paris Agreement (PA), under which 191 countries, including Liberia, committed to limit global warming to &ldquo;well below 2 degrees above pre- industrial levels,&rdquo; and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg;C. NDCs are the delivery mechanism to reach the PA goals and achieving the overall global greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation target, embodying efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement requests countries to develop and submit updated NDCs every five years to the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat. These NDCs are expected to reflect increased ambition, whether in terms of strengthened targets, accelerated timelines, or a broader scope covering additional sectors or greenhouse gases. Liberia submitted her first NDC in 2015 and committed to revising and submitting an updated version as required by the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>In so doing, Liberia revised her Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) through robust stakeholder engagement processes. During the process, a whole-of-government-whole of society participatory approach was employed. Stakeholders involved in the process included: sectoral line ministries and agencies of government, private sector, civil society organizations, youth and women groups, national experts, and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>The revision of Liberia&rsquo;s NDC began with a joint analysis of existing and proposed sectors through a detailed assessment of mitigation and adaptation measures and opportunities. Building upon this analysis, the NDC was then constructed via stakeholder consultation and participation, technical analysis of all the sectors, sectoral analysis reports, NDC costing and cost-benefit analysis, and workshop reports. The NDC revision also builds upon key national planning documents, including Liberia&rsquo;s first NDC (2015-2020), the National Climate Change and Response Strategy (2018), Liberia&rsquo;s Second National Communication, State of the Environment Reports, Liberia&rsquo;s first Biennial Update Report (BUR). Liberia&rsquo;s revised NDC is well aligned with the national government's Pro-poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) and its long-term sustainable development vision for 2030 (Liberia&rsquo;s Rising Vision 2030).</p>
<p>In its revised NDC, Liberia commits to reducing its economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 64% below the projected business-as-usual level by 2030, through a combination of the following: unconditional GHG reductions of 10% below BAU, resulting in an absolute emissions level of 11,187Gg CO2e in 2030; with an additional 54% reduction conditional upon international support, which would result in an absolute emissions level of 4,537Gg CO2e in 2030.</p>
<p>This commitment is constructed from GHG mitigation targets across nine key sectors &ndash; Agriculture, Forests, Coastal zones, Fisheries, Health, Transport, Industry, Energy, and Waste &ndash; as well as cross-cutting targets for urban green corridors. The NDC also includes climate change adaptation targets for eight sectors &ndash; Agriculture, Forests, Coastal zones, Fisheries, Health, Transport, Energy, and Waste &ndash; as well as cross-cutting targets for urban green corridors. The NDC outlines a national system for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) for mitigation actions and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) for adaptation actions to implement the NDC. It has also stated the policy and institutional arrangement for the NDC implementation and added the analysis of its co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation, and as well the direct and indirect investment needed to implement the NDC.</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>1.1 Background</p>
<p>Liberia recognizes the current and future threats of climate change and has taken several initiatives to address those threats. Key among them are the ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement; the implementation of a number of climate change programs and activities including the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA), the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), the development of Liberia&rsquo;s Initial National Communication, the development of a National Policy and Response Strategy on Climate Change, among others, are all aimed at achieving the country&rsquo;s commitments to global climate change initiatives. Liberia&rsquo;s National Policy and Response Strategy on Climate Change, for instance, aims to ensure that a qualitative, effective, and coherent climate change adaptation process takes place, and also to serve as the pillar for comprehensive sectoral strategies and action plans.</p>
<p>The government has shown leadership in addressing climate change issues as demonstrated through its submission of an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2015, now the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) following the country&rsquo;s ratification of the Paris Agreement in 2018. The 2015 NDC aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% below business-as-usual levels by 2030 with a long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, conditional upon international support. It also highlighted the crucial role of adaptation in ensuring the resilience of the country&rsquo;s communities and natural systems. The government continues to show such leadership as demonstrated through the development and subsequent submission of this revised NDC in fulfillment of its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Liberia&rsquo;s revised NDC addresses nine (9) key sectors &ndash; Agriculture, Forests, Coastal zones, Fisheries, Health, Transport, Industry, Energy, and Waste &ndash; as well as cross-cutting targets for urban green corridors. The development of Liberia&rsquo;s NDC was informed by a joint analysis of existing and proposed sectors for updating Liberia&rsquo;s NDC, a more detailed assessment of mitigation and adaptation measures, improved information, and data, as well as increased stakeholder consultation and participation. It presents a platform to integrate Liberia&rsquo;s Low Carbon Development Strategy into the country&rsquo;s medium-term development agenda (PAPD) as well as its long-term sustainable development vision by 2030 (Liberia&rsquo;s Rising Vision 2030).</p>
<p>1.2 National Circumstances</p>
<p>Liberia is located on the Atlantic Coast in the southern part of West Africa and lies between longitudes 7&deg;30` and 11&deg;30` west and latitudes 4&deg;18` and 8&deg;30` north. The country covers 111,369 km2 and has borders with C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire to the east, Sierra Leone to the west, Guinea to the north, and to the south with the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Liberia&rsquo;s population was 3.5 million people in 2008 and is estimated to have increased to 4.8 million people by 2018. The country&rsquo;s population is projected to reach at 10.3 million by 2050, with more than 70% of the population living in coastal cities, including Monrovia, Liberia&rsquo;s capital. The country&rsquo;s economy has experienced high growth since 2006 despite a decline from 2008 to 2010 largely attributed to the global financial crisis. The economy rebounded in 2011 with a combined increase in economic activities from the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors contributing 41% of the GDP and providing employment for 47% of the labor force. These sectors were driven by increased exports, especially in forestry, fisheries and rubber, followed by subsistence production of cassava and rice. The emergence of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in 2014, coupled with the global economic meltdown, resulted in numerous challenges and subsequent decline in the country&rsquo;s economy between 2015 and 2018. Liberia&rsquo;s economy was projected to rebound in 2020, but due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, there was a further decline. Real GDP growth in 2020 was projected to rebound to 1.4 percent; with said growth driven mostly by increased activities in both mining and non-mining sectors. Moreover, the rebound momentum was projected to continue in the medium term (2021 &ndash; 2024) with growth averaging around 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>Based on historical trends from 2009 to 2012, temperatures in Liberia typically vary between 23&deg; C and 33&deg; C and are rarely below 21&deg; C or above 34&deg; C. The records show the existence of a warm season between early January to early May, with an average daily high temperature above 31&deg; C. There also exists a cold season that runs from early July to mid-September, with an average daily high temperature below 28&deg; C. There are two major seasons in Liberia: rainy and dry. The rainy season lasts from mid-April to late October, whilst the dry season lasts from mid-November to mid-April. Average annual rainfall along the coastal belt is over 4,000 mm and declines to 1,300 mm at the forest-savanna boundary north of the coastal belt. The months of heaviest rainfall in Liberia are June, July and September.</p>
<p>1.3 Policy, Legal and Institutional Frameworks</p>
<p>1.3.1 Policy and Legal Frameworks</p>
<p>The Government of Liberia is committed to tackling climate change challenges through several national policies and strategic interventions. An overview of some key national policies related to development priorities and climate change mitigation and adaptation are outlined below:</p>
<p>Liberia Rising Vision 2030: Liberia&rsquo;s Vision 2030 is an overarching vision of the government of Liberia to direct the country to a developed society which includes a range of Pillars, Sector Goals, Strategic Objectives and Outcome Indicators, which together support the development of adaptation and mitigation capacity in Liberia.</p>
<p>Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) (2018-2023): This is a five-year national development plan aimed at addressing the basic needs of Liberians for income security, better access to basic services, and greater opportunities for self-improvement in an enabling environment that is inclusive and stable. Its long-term goal is to raise the per capita income levels and economic status of Liberia to a middle-income country, as outlined under the Vision 2030 framework. The PAPD aligns with the African Union Agenda 2063 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across all three sustainability dimensions &ndash; economic, social, and environmental &ndash; with a special emphasis on human development and peace.</p>
<p>Environment Protection and Management Law (2003): This Law forms the legal framework for sustainable development, management and protection of the environment and natural resources by the Environment Protection Agency in partnership with relevant ministries, autonomous agencies, and organizations, as well as in a close and responsive relationship with the people of Liberia. It addresses a wide range of environmental issues, including environmental impact assessment, guidelines and standards, international obligations, education, and awareness.</p>
<p>National Environmental Policy (2003): Liberia formulated a national environmental policy to recognize the severe impact of human activities on all components of the natural environment, especially the influences of population dynamics, high density urbanization, and resource exploitation, as well as recognize the critical importance of restoring and maintaining environmental quality for the welfare and development of the people. The aim of the National Environmental Policy is to ensure the improvement of the physical environment, the quality of life of the people, and the economic and social living conditions of the entire citizenry. It seeks to ensure reconciliation and coordination between economic development and growth with the sustainable management of natural resources.</p>
<p>National Policy and Response Strategy on Climate Change (2018): This national policy is a vehicle developed to support climate change adaptation, disaster risk management and mitigation capacity in Liberia. It focuses on the implementation of Liberia&rsquo;s commitment to achieving the SDGs, especially Goals 13, 14 and 15, which focus on combatting climate change and fostering sustainability. The Climate Change Policy also focuses on achieving Africa&rsquo;s vision for promoting positive socio-economic transformation (Agenda 2063 adopted in 2013) over the next 50 years. The agenda 2063 recognizes climate change and natural disasters as major threats to Africa&rsquo;s development now and in the future.</p>
<p>1.3.2 Institutional Framework</p>
<p>The National Climate Change Steering Committee (NCCSC) is the supreme institutional body responsible for coordinating and supervising the implementation of climate change policy and other related activities in Liberia. The NCCSC is chaired by the office of the President of the Republic of Liberia, or his/her designate, and supported through a National Climate Change Secretariat seated at the EPA to ensure the implementation of its daily activities.</p>
<p>The EPA is Liberia&rsquo;s Designated National Authority for the UNFCCC and has the mandate as the national regulatory agency for sustainable environmental management, including climate change. Section 5 of the Act Creating the Environment Protection Agency of the Republic of Liberia of 2002 mandates the Agency to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>collaborate with key line ministries and agencies to coordinate, integrate, harmonize and monitor the implementation of environmental policy and integrate environmental concerns in overall national development planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collect, collate, and analyse basic scientific data and other information pertaining to pollution, degradation of ecosystems and on environmental quality and resource use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>train and build the capacity of line ministries and agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the preservation and promotion of important historic, cultural, and spiritual values of natural resource heritage; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in consultation with local authorities, enhance effective natural resource management plans and activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve its statutory mandate and other obligations, the EPA collaborates with several key entities including the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning which serves as chair of the EPA&rsquo;s Board, Forestry Development Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, National Disaster Management Agency, Ministry of Mines and Energy, Ministry of Internal Affairs, among others. This collaboration extends to the fulfilment of Liberia&rsquo;s commitment to the Paris Agreement including the development of the NDC.</p>
<p>2.0 LIBERIA&rsquo;S NDC REVISION PROCESS</p>
<p>2.1 Review of Relevant Literature</p>
<p>A desk review was conducted through the sourcing of information and datasets from national databases and relevant literature including technical publications, sector specific reports, and other research papers; and was complemented by the appraisal of products developed during the NDC revision process. Of key significance is the Joint Analysis of Existing and Proposed Sectors for Updating Liberia&rsquo;s Nationally Determined Contribution, which was conducted by the government and its partners to kick-start and guide the Liberia&rsquo;s NDC revision process. The Joint Analysis report analyzes the national context for each of the proposed NDC sectors, underscores existing progress and challenges since 2015, identifies mitigation and adaptation opportunities, and prepares initial recommendations for consideration during the NDC update process, which was designed to take a consultative, whole-of-government approach. The review and all recommendations from this study were intended to serve as a starting point for technical expert input and consultation under the direction of the EPA.</p>
<p>Additionally, other relevant literature was consulted, including but not limited to the following documents: Liberia&rsquo;s NDC (2015-2020), all reports from the NDC revision process, all technical reports on the ten sectors identified for the revised NDC, sectoral analysis reports, other cross cutting NDC workshop reports, National Policy and Response Strategy on Climate Change (2018), Liberia&rsquo;s Second National Communication, State of Environment Reports, Liberia&rsquo;s first Biennial Update Report (BUR-1), Pro-poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, and Liberia&rsquo;s Rising Vision 2030, etc.</p>
<p>2.2 Categorization of Stakeholders</p>
<p>Through a well-thought-out strategy, a list of key stakeholders was developed, and stakeholder engagement plans rolled out to ensure meaningful engagement and participation of all stakeholders in the revision process. Stakeholders were categorized according to several relevant indicators and considerations, including technical experts, national and sub-national officials of government, women, youth, private sector, non-governmental organizations, and civil society, etc. as well as into regional and city segments to ensure the full participation of cross section of the citizenry. Stakeholders were also placed into two broad categories: the first being the widely recognized stakeholders, which are segments of the population or governance structures that themselves are policy and decision makers, administrators, and are frequently recognized and consulted; and the second being the vulnerable groups who are not regularly recognized. These stakeholders were engaged through various platforms as outlined in Section 2.3 below.</p>
<p>2.3 Consultative Meetings</p>
<p>2.3.1 Regional Consultations</p>
<p>Three (3) regional consultative meetings were held. The first was held in Gompa City, Nimba County on September 17, 2020, which brought together delegates comprising local county officials, women, youth, and representatives of line ministries, agencies, and commissions at the county level from five (5) counties including Nimba, Bong, Lofa, Grand Gedeh and River Gee. The second meeting was held in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County on September 25, 2020, and brought together participants from Grand Bassa, Rivercess, Sinoe, Grand Kru, and Maryland counties. The third meeting was held in Tubmanburg City, Bomi County on September 30, 2020, and brought together participants from Bomi, Grand Cape Mount,</p>
<p>Gbarpolu, Margibi and Montserrado counties. The regional meetings were delivered through thematic expert presentations, break-out and brainstorming sessions, and plenary discussions, feedback presentations of outcomes from break-out meetings and group recommendations and resolutions. Key presentations included: an overview of the Paris Agreement, roadmap for the revision of Liberia&rsquo;s Nationally Determined Contribution, Joint Analysis of Existing and Proposed sectors for Updating Liberia&rsquo;s Nationally Determined Contribution, mainstreaming capacity building in the NDC revision process, integrating the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) approaches into NDC processes, among others. During these regional meetings, the delegates agreed to remain engaged and contribute to the overall NDC revision process as well as contribute significantly to the full implementation of Liberia&rsquo;s revised NDC. All feedback was captured in workshop reports that fed into the NDC revision process.</p>
<p>2.3.2 Technical/Expert Group</p>
<p>The Technical/Expert Group meeting was held from 10th -11th September 2020 in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County. This meeting brought together a total of 86 technicians and experts from government line ministries, agencies, commissions as well as those from civil society, private institutions, and academia to brainstorm on sectoral approaches to reduce greenhouse gas levels and the impacts of climate change in Liberia as part of Liberia&rsquo;s revised NDC. The technical workshop was delivered through series of presentations, technical working group discussions, as well as presentation of feedback, group outcomes and reports. The composition of each working group was based on the technical expertise within a given sector. The technical workshop reassessed the existing NDC sectors targets and put forth recommendations including the analysis and inclusion of new targets, as well as the identification of additional sectors, for inclusion into Liberia&rsquo;s revised NDC. Feedback from this meeting was also captured in workshop reports that fed into the NDC revision process.</p>
<p>2.3.3 Youth Dialogue</p>
<p>The Youth Dialogue was held on September 16, 2020, in Gompa City, Nimba County. This meeting brought together over thirty-five (35) youth organizations across Liberia, including the Federation of Liberian Youth; Mano River Union Youth Parliament Liberia Chapter; West African Youth Network, Liberia; Tubman University Volunteer Movement (TUVM); Liberia National Students&rsquo; Union; Youth Climate Change Initiative- Liberia; ECOWAS Youth Commission; Liberia Girl&rsquo;s Guide; African Youth with Disabilities Liberia Chapter; among others. The Youth Dialogue produced the &ldquo;Ganta Declaration&rdquo; which commits the youth population of Liberia to remaining engaged in throughout the NDC development and implementation process. Since the signing of this Declaration, the Youth community of Liberia remained fully engaged throughout the NDC revision process through their representatives whose valuable participations and inputs contributed to the development of Liberia&rsquo;s revised NDC.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Gender Dialogue</p>
<p>The National Gender Dialogue was held under the theme &ldquo;Women leading for climate action; a catalyst for Liberia&rsquo;s NDC ambition&rdquo; from October 27-28, 2020, in Gompa City, Nimba County. The goal was to incorporate gender inclusiveness in Liberia&rsquo;s NDC for an effective and efficient implementation. The main objectives included to champion the advancement of women&rsquo;s economic empowerment and participation in the revision process of Liberia&rsquo;s NDC; ensure that women remain an integral part of Liberia&rsquo;s NDC revision process; and ensure inclusiveness in environmental planning and decision-making through capacity building for women owned enterprises to enable their integration of are into the mainstream economic activity, environmental and climate change discussion and decision-making.</p>
<p>The Gender Dialogue targeted civil society groups promoting gender equality and women empowerment, gender coordinators across Liberia&rsquo;s 15 political sub-divisions, as well as the private sector and community-based groups supporting women&rsquo;s empowerment. The dialogue achieved the following commitments: that women took ownership of the NDC revision process for effective implementation; that women actively and equally engaged men and other gender groups in the NDC actions and in decision-making to help ensure an inclusive approach in national climate strategies and actions; and that all participants work towards the fulfilment of both the NDC and the Paris Agreement, and most importantly towards more inclusive and sustainable development outcomes through the preparation of the declaration.</p>
<p>2.3.5 Private Sector</p>
<p>The Private Sector Dialogue was held in Paynesville City, Montserrado County, on November 12, 2020, under the theme &ldquo;Private Sector: A catalyst in boosting NDC implementation for a resilient economy&rdquo;. The goal of this dialogue was to encourage the participation of the private sector in Liberia&rsquo;s NDC for an inclusive implementation of climate change management. The following were the objectives of the Private Sector Dialogue: to provide and encourage the participation and contribution of the private sector in the revision process of Liberia&rsquo;s NDC; to engage the private sector to take ownership of this NDC revision and implementation process; to systematically attract private finance through public-private partnerships and other means to contribute to the scaling up of climate change adaptation activities through promoting innovation and participation of the private sector in climate change adaptation/mitigation planning, etc.</p>
<p>The Private sector dialogue targeted all private sector institutions, Liberian businesses, non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Community Based Organizations (CBOs), media houses, all groups and associations, manufacturers, individuals, etc. involved one way or the other into private businesses in Liberia. During this dialogue, the private sector actors agreed to join the government and other partners in their efforts of NDC revision process, and also help to mitigate the impacts of climate change; to become an active partner in adaptation efforts as they have the potential to bolster government&rsquo;s efforts and complement adaptation measurers to help in climate change risk management; and to integrate adaptation measures into their strategies and investments in at risk sectors such as agriculture, tourism and energy, to make their investments and returns less risky and ultimately more profitable. At the end of the workshop, a general commitment to forge a new alliance with the government was made, with all participating institutions encourage to forge a public private partnership with the government and other partners to address the impacts of climate change and seek sustainable solutions that deliver a win-win outcome for the government, communities, and businesses in Liberia and to be a part of the Liberia&rsquo;s NDC.</p>
<p>Additional consultative meetings undertaken to inform the outcome of Liberia&rsquo;s NDC revision included other technical meetings and regional validation workshops and presentations on urban green corridors, NDC costing/financing.</p>
<p>2.3.6 Regional Review and Validation of Liberia&rsquo;s NDC</p>
<p>The NDC revision process was concluded with the hosting of three regional validation workshops across Liberia aimed at reviewing and validating the agreed targets and measures as proposed and developed by stakeholders during the revision processes. These workshops were held respectively in Buchanan, Kakata and Gompa cities and brought together participants from across the length and breadth of Liberia to review and validate the final Revised NDC for onward submission to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the regional review and validation workshops was to formally present the draft revised NDC report, as developed through stakeholders&rsquo; participation, to regional stakeholders across Liberia for their review, confirmation, inputs and endorsement ahead of the national validation and subsequent approval by the Cabinet. This goal was achieved at the end of the three workshops which saw the overwhelming endorsement of the draft revised NDC report by key regional stakeholders representing the 15 political sub-division of Liberia.</p>
<p>These regional validation workshops were preceded by series of technical expert reviews involving key subject-matter experts from across NDC-related sectoral institutions, including the Environmental Protection Agency, Forestry Development Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Mines and Energy, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Gender and Children Protection, Liberia Maritime Authority, National Fisheries and Aquaculture Authority, etc. These experts were supported remotely by international experts from CI, EU-Climate Change Alliance+, and the UNDP-Climate Promise. These technical reviews resulted in the finalization of Liberia&rsquo;s Revised NDC for approval by the Office of the President and subsequent submission to the UNFCCC Secretariat.</p>
<p>3.0 CONTRIBUTIONS</p>
<p>3.1 Mitigation</p>
<p>Liberia commits to reducing its economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 64% below the projected business-as-usual level by 2030, through a combination of the following: unconditional GHG reductions of 10% below BAU, resulting in an absolute emissions level of 11,187Gg CO2e in 2030; with an additional 54% reduction conditional upon international support, which would result in an absolute emissions level of 4,536.64 Gg CO2e in 2030. To achieve this target, the country has included additional sectors to those previously included in the 2015 NDC. <em><strong>Table 1.0 </strong></em>provides details on the sectors, their proposed targets, as well as mitigation actions and policy measures to achieve the stated targets.</p>
<p>The extent of implementation and achievement of the targets as proposed in this updated NDC are mainly conditioned upon the provision of adequate means of implementation (financial resources, capacity building and technology transfer, etc.) by the international community. This condition does not, however, constitute an international obligation to Liberia. The government is also committed to unconditionally support the implementation and achievement of Liberia&rsquo;s overall targets through other financial mechanisms including the traditional budgetary allocation to the environment sector.</p>
<p>The government is further committed, through several national programs and policies, including the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) strategy, to reducing GHG emissions levels in line with its target. In demonstration of its commitment, the country has already submitted its forest reference emissions level to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and aims to, among other things, achieve its Vision 2030 through a low- carbon, climate-resilient development pathway through the implementation and periodic updating of key national and climate change policies and action plans to achieve its targets.</p>

<p>Liberia is located on the Atlantic Coast in the southern part of West Africa and lies between longitudes 7&deg;30` and 11&deg;30` west and latitudes 4&deg;18` and 8&deg;30` north. The country covers 111,369 km2 and has borders with C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire to the east, Sierra Leone to the west, Guinea to the north, and to the south by the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Liberia&rsquo;s population was 3.5 million people in 2008 and is estimated to have increased to 4.8 million people by 2018. The country&rsquo;s population is projected to reach at 10.3 million by 2050, with more than 70% of the population living in coastal cities, including Monrovia, Liberia&rsquo;s capital. The country&rsquo;s economy has experienced high growth since 2006 despite a decline from 2008 to 2010 largely attributed to the global financial crisis. The economy rebounded in 2011 with a combined increase in economic activities from the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors contributing 41% of the GDP and providing employment for 47% of the labor force. These sectors were driven by increased exports, especially in forestry, fisheries, and rubber, followed by subsistence production of cassava and rice. The emergence of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in 2014, coupled with the global economic meltdown, resulted in numerous challenges and subsequent decline in the country&rsquo;s economy between 2015 and 2018. Liberia&rsquo;s economy was projected to rebound in 2020 but due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, there was a further decline. Real GDP growth in 2020 was projected to rebound to 1.4 percent; with said growth driven mostly by increased activities in both mining and non-mining sectors. Moreover, the rebound momentum was projected to continue in the medium term (2021 &ndash; 2024) with growth averaging around 4.4 percent.</p>

<p>In accounting for the NDC, Liberia uses the IPCC 2006 guidelines and the 100-year global warming potential from AR5, for estimating anthropogenic emissions and removals.</p>
<p>The IPCC 2006 Guidelines has been supplemented with the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program/ European Environment Agency (EMEP/EEA) air pollutant emission inventory guidebook for compiling estimates for nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulphur dioxide (SO2).</p>

Global Warming Potentials (GWP) as recommended by the IPCC, have been used to convert GHGs other than CO2 to the latter equivalent.</p>
<p>Consistent with Good Practice in the 2006 IPCC guidelines, as much as possible, Liberia has used available official national statistics for the inventory. Where country-specific AD is not available, data from recognized international organizations (FAO, AU, ITTO, IEA) has been used to fill the gap. Some data gaps were filled through personal contacts and from results of surveys, scientific studies and by statistical modelling. Local experts' knowledge was resorted to as the last option. Thus, data collected at the national level from numerous public and private institutions, organizations, and companies, and archived by the EPA/LISGIS provided the basis and starting point. In a few isolated cases, due to the restricted timeframe and the inexistence of a declared national framework for data collection and archiving to meet the requirements for preparing GHG inventories, derived data and estimates were made to fill in the gaps. These were considered reliable and sound since they were based on scientific findings and other observations. Not all the AD required to compile an exhaustive GHG inventory could be collected due to the short timeframe or absence of a proper data collection and archiving system, and some categories could not be assessed due to the civil conflict. Nevertheless, the data collected was used to make estimates that are of good quality.</p>

<p>3.3 Adaptation</p>
<p>Liberia faces significant climate change-associated risks due to high level of dependence on climate- sensitive activities, including rain-fed agriculture, which make the country vulnerable to climate variability and change. The Liberian population experiences the impacts of climate change in loss of livelihoods, income, and settlements, as well as increased risks for adverse health impacts. The National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) process of 2004 revealed that the adverse effects of climate change variability and extreme events are already significantly impacting Liberia. The climate hazards identified during the NAPA process include changes in rainfall patterns, extreme coastal flooding events, and sea level rise. The adaptation policy framework of Liberia recognizes that there are four principles that provide the basis from which integrated actions to adapt to climate change can be developed: (1) adaptation to short-term climate variability and extreme events serve as a starting point for reducing vulnerability to longer-term climate change; (2) adaptation must occur at different levels in society, including the local level; (3) adaptation policy and measures must be assessed in a development context; and (4) the adaptation strategy and the stakeholder process by which it is implemented must be given equal importance. Based on this framework and the elements of adaptation strategy, key additional sectors were identified, and their corresponding adaptation policy and strategies formulated.</p>

<p>4.0 MONITORING, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION (MRV)</p>
<p>As a means of showing its commitment to the Paris Agreement, Liberia has developed a national MRV system to measure, verify and report progress for emissions, reductions, and removals. The national MRV system incorporates relevant key actors and institutions involved with climate MRV, including GHG emission inventories, GHG mitigation actions, climate finance, and climate impacts to enable tracking of climate change actions and reports. Liberia&rsquo;s national MRV system is a single entity driven system solely implemented by the Environment Protection Agency. The national MRV system also contains a set of measuring and monitoring tools and protocols for measurement, verification, and reporting. In the case of forest measurement for example, the following exists: Forest Reference Emissions Level (FREL); National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS); and National Forest Inventory and Living Standard Measurement System (NFI &amp; LSMS). Similarly, for forest verification and reporting, the follow exists: MRV institutional arrangement protocol/regulation; IPCC reporting guidelines; and NFI and Administrative Standard Operating Procedures (AD-SOP's), and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The forest MRV system tracks GHG emissions reductions and removals through the FREL and biennial change monitoring of forest and is linked directly to national legislations and other thematic institutional mandates.</p>
<p>Liberia&rsquo;s National Policy and Response Strategy on Climate Change informs the development and implementation of the MRV system. Liberia&rsquo;s MRV system is also being supported by the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) project with support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and implemented by the Government of Liberia through the Environment Protection Agency of Liberia and Conservation International. The governance structure of Liberia&rsquo;s national MRV system allows the EPA to lead on the coordination and reporting of all climate- related MRV activities to the UNFCCC and other bodies. All reports produced through the national MRV system will contribute to addressing various reporting obligation to the UNFCCC and other relevant institutions. The national MRV system will be used to ensure and achieve the implementation of Liberia&rsquo;s revised NDC.</p>
<p>Liberia also intends to strengthen its MRV systems by expanding on existing national MRV system to integrate agriculture and livestock and product traceability system, with a spatial data management system for sustainable land use management by 2025; and by also establishing comprehensive measurement, reporting, and verification systems for coastal zones and forests, including community- based monitoring systems by 2025.</p>
<p>On the overall this will enhance existing national MRV systems to track NDC progress and mitigation actions over time.</p>
<p>5.0 FAIRNESS AND AMBITION</p>
<p>Liberia is committed to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement of keeping the temperature rise well below 2&deg; C, aiming to limit warming to 1.5&deg; C, provided that the international community supports Liberia with the appropriate means of implementation. As a Party to the Paris Agreement, Liberia aims to achieve fair and ambitious contributions to reducing its emissions and has therefore adopted GHG reduction targets by 2030 in this NDC. To achieve this, the country has set short, medium, and long terms targets in its NDC and further committed two additional sectors that were not included in the 2015 NDC &ndash; short- lived climate pollutants and green corridors. Further, the revised NDC includes new mitigation targets for sectors that previously only had adaptation targets in the 2015 NDC, including forests, agriculture, fisheries, health, and coastal zones, thus raising its realistic ambitions, and fairly contributing towards this great global effort of keeping the temperature within healthy planetary boundaries.</p>
<p>Liberia&rsquo;s contribution to global GHG emissions was 3.51 MtCO2 eq in 2014, representing 0.01% of the global total. The country is fully committed to continuing in this path in order to achieve a low carbon resilient development in line with its short-, medium- and long-term development agenda. Liberia further commits to reducing its economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 64% below the projected business- as-usual (BAU) level by 2030 as indicated in Section 3.1 above through a combination of 10% unconditional contribution and an additional 54% conditional upon international support. Thus, Liberia&rsquo;s NDC targets reflect high level of fairness and significant climate ambition given its status as a Least Developed Country couple with its current and historical low contribution to GHG emissions.</p>
<p>6.0 NDC IMPLEMENTATION</p>
<p>To fully implement Liberia&rsquo;s mitigation and adaptation actions under its revised NDC, there is a need for adequate, predictable, and sustainable financial, technological, and capacity support and mechanisms provided by various sources. The NDC Costing and Cost-Benefit analysis estimated that a total investment of US$490,590,000 dollars through 2025 will be needed to achieve Liberia&rsquo;s NDC mitigation and adaptation targets. Of this amount, US$400,645,000 dollars will be required to achieve Liberia&rsquo;s mitigation targets, whilst US$89,945,000 dollars will be required to achieve its adaptation targets. To achieve the conditional portion of its NDC target, Liberia intends to mobilize approximately US$460,000,000 dollars from the private sector, bilateral and multilateral sources and all other sources, mechanisms, and instruments. The investment in achieving Liberia&rsquo;s NDC will yield direct and indirect economic benefits of approximately US$3.2 billion dollars, thus, generating significant returns for the global climate, Liberia&rsquo;s economy, and the well-being of its citizens.</p>
<p>Liberia also plans to develop a tracking system to analyze the support (finance, technology transfer and capacity building) for implementation. The country will consider inclusion of international carbon market mechanisms, including cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, as these economic instruments, supported by appropriate accounting systems (i.e., MRV systems), can be used to help finance low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure investments. Liberia considers that some low carbon development options in the NDC, or additional actions, could be financed in full or in part, through the transfer of international carbon credits/assets or results-based financing, in line with the guidance to be agreed under Article 6, taking into account environmental integrity and transparency.</p>
<p>Liberia recognizes that its system of Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) is a fundamental pillar of its NDC for the purpose of transparency and accountability. The MRV system for the NDC will build upon existing structures for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) and inter-sectoral coordination. In this regard, the country will require further support to ensure that its MRV system is strengthened (institutional arrangement and responsibilities, indicators, methodologies) in order to track progress toward the implementation of NDCs including non-GHG co-benefits.</p>
<p>With support from the NDC Partnership, Liberia has begun the process to develop an NDC Implementation Plan, which will provide the timeframe for implementation and detail the short- and long-term actions required to reach the climate mitigation and adaptation goals as outlined in the revised NDC. The Plan will integrate all relevant elements required for Liberia to achieve its NDC, including the enabling conditions, policy frameworks, institutional arrangements, climate related MRV systems, gender equality and social inclusion, and financing strategies. The plan will further establish a clear logical framework that defines outcomes, outputs, and activities, including within sectoral plans, leading to the achievement of stated targets, describes vital enabling conditions for the NDC implementation based on an analysis of key barriers and gaps, such as new or improved policies and regulations, capacity-building, technical assistance, awareness raising, etc. Liberia&rsquo;s NDC Implementation Plan will describe the roles and responsibilities of relevant institutions and institutional frameworks in NDC implementation, reporting, coordination, support, and finance, as well as a description of the MRV systems that will track progress toward achievement of the NDC targets, among others.</p>
