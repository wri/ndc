<h1>Nationally Determined Contributions 2020 Update</h1>
<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This document constitutes an update of Mexico's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in accordance with the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC, by its acronym in Spanish) and pursuant to decisions 1/CMA.2 and 1/CP.21 and Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The Government of Mexico hereby ratifies the commitments submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention’s Secretariat in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as its interest in working collaboratively with the international community in order to keep the increase in global temperature well below 2°C and to pursue additional efforts to limit to 1.5°C, by acting both on adaptation and mitigation actions on equal degrees of importance. The mitigation component considers unconditional contributions, which will be implemented with the country's own resources, and conditional contributions, which require the support of financial, technical and technological instruments, as well as capacity-building which will accelerate the implementation of mitigation actions across the country.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unconditional contributions:</strong> Consist of, alternatively: Reduction of 22% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and 51% of black carbon emissions by 2030 as compared to the baseline business-as- usual scenario (BAU).</li>
<li><strong>Conditional contributions:</strong> A reduction of up to 36% of GHG emissions and 70% of black carbon emissions by 2030 compared to the BAU scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adaptation component reflects a greater understanding of the country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, and it includes 5 general themes, or axes, and 27 lines of action focused on implementation.</p>
<p>This document features the criteria employed by Mexico to define the scope of the NDC’s update, the expanded adaptation component, and the strengthened mitigation component.It also contains, as a
single annex, information pertaining to 4/CMA.1 of the Katowice Rulebook on the Enhanced Transparency
Framework regarding implementation and monitoring of the NDC.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Through this NDC update, Mexico ratifies its commitment to tackle climate change, a global effort that requires, today more than ever, the action of all countries. Our world and our civilization are facing a far-reaching crisis with multiple facets; the adverse effects of climate change which represent systemic and ecological imbalances, exacerbated by an economic growth model that has not considered the limits of the environment and the planetary ability to maintain life-supporting systems; a loss of traditions and biocultural wealth that characterize our societies, where extreme poverty is a disruptive manifestation of an exclusionary and predatory growth model; and a health crisis, which reminds us that the degradation of ecosystems and the excessive exploitation of wildlife is linked intrinsically to our health, compromising the social and economic well-being of our common home.</p>
<p>The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has forced nations to rethink their development models. In this context, Mexico’s NDC update within the framework of the Paris Agreement establishes the basis for moving towards a responsible and sustainable recovery. The Mexican Government recognizes the close link between environmental protection and well-being of the population as a necessary condition to access other dimensions of well-being such as health, food security and employment. In light of this, Mexico has adopted the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the guiding axis for this inclusive development.</p>
<p>Actions planned to be undertaken within the framework of the NDC consider the synergies between the adaptation and mitigation components as well as their relationship with the SDGs and other international conventions. As a result, Mexico has focused its public policies on poverty abatement with an orientation that seeks to lay the foundations for a more balanced, and equitable sustainable development, following the premise established in the National Development Plan 2019-2024 of "leaving no one behind, leaving no one out".</p>
<p>The adverse effects of climate change threaten the exercise of fundamental human rights: access to a healthy environment, health, food, drinking water, adequate housing, education, and culture, as well as the right to self-development and to life itself<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
. With this awareness, the inseparable link between the protection of human rights and action against climate change is becoming increasingly evident. The consequences of the adverse effects of this global phenomenon are even more serious for individuals and groups in vulnerable social, economic and environmental situations, including women, indigenous and Afro-Mexican communities, children, youth, migrants, people with disabilities, sexual minorities, low-income groups, and the elderly<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>Mexico is amongst the top 20 emitters of the 195 considered by the United Nations. In the last 20 years, its position has shifted between the 11th and the 13th place. While the first to ten emitters are responsible for around 66% of the total emissions, it is rather clear that Mexico has a myriad of opportunities to undertake changes leading to the diversification of its energy matrix, and to lead transformational changes in its productive sector focusing on the population´s welfare and in the protection and sustainable use of its cultural and natural wealth.</p>
<p>The effects of climate change are already tangible in the national territory, thereby confirming that adaptation and risk reduction are tasks that cannot be postponed, so they must be integrated into socioeconomic planning and development. In the last 50 years, average temperatures in the country have increased approximately 0.85°C above the climate normal, or climatological normal, in line with the global increase reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
.</p>


<p>Minimum and maximum temperatures show a trend towards an increase in warm nights and a decrease of cold ones throughout the country<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
. Regarding precipitation, observations show that the spatial and temporal distribution has changed in a differential way throughout the territory, even though the volume has remained constant. These situations have impacts on ecological and productive systems that are highly sensitive to temperature and precipitation variations, resulting in economic loss, which may increase in the future under climate change scenarios.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill the mandate to increase the population’s engagement in the construction of the NDC, during 2020, a participatory process was conducted nationwide. This process included Ministries of State, through the Intersecretarial Commission on Climate Change (CICC, by its acronym in Spanish), as well as state governments, scholars, social organizations, the private sector, and the public. It is noteworthy to underline the participation of young generations who have shown leadership and a growing commitment in addressing climate change. Their active participation in this participatory process allowed for the inclusion of their concerns and proposals in this document. In addition, as a result of this process, the NDC enhances its means of implementation to meet the objectives of development of science and technology, encouraging research, education, training, social awareness, access to information and citizen participation within a framework of constant technological innovation in order to achieve full territorialization and engagement in adaptation and mitigation actions.</p>
<p>Mexico has strengthened the means and mechanisms to implement its climate policy and the NDC itself, through its incorporation into the LGCC. It has also taken strong steps to integrate and execute actions that address climate change in programs, projects, and actions at different orders of government that will serve as enhanced mechanisms for the implementation of the NDC.</p>
<p>The Mexican Government ratifies its commitment to implement the NDC respecting human rights, integrating a gender equality approach, prioritizing the needs of vulnerable groups, and promoting the inclusion and recognition of science and traditional knowledge of native indigenous communities under the principle of intergenerational equity. Reports on the progress of the NDC’s implementation will incorporate the objectives and goals of the Lima Work Program on Gender and the UNCCD Gender Action Plan. As a signatory of the Escazú Agreement, Mexico will abide by the objectives of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, under the principle of equal rights between women and men, as well as the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</p>
<p>In this context, as a middle-income developing country, Mexico is committed to foster south-south and triangular cooperation in order to support other countries in achieving more ambitious adaptation and mitigation goals in accordance with national development priorities for each country. Mexico will focus on scientific and technological cooperation as well as the promotion of research capacity building regarding adaptation and mitigation, and considering its strategic position, will strive to develop partnerships with Latin America and the Caribbean to foster regional development.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mexico recognizes that cooperation and climate finance are tools that can bolster the implementation of its commitments and expresses its interest in advancing and implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in order to increase its climate ambition. Therefore, the Mexican Government reaffirms the call on the international community to adopt Conference of the Parties, the required rules to make this mechanism operational and thus allow for cost-effective international cooperation, enhancing a greater participation of the private sector in global mitigation.</p>


<h2>Adaptation Component</h2>


<p>Mexico is a megadiverse country with coastline on both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
 unique in its biological wealth at the continental, coastal and marine levels. In addition, it has a vast and diverse cultural heritage that results in a wide range of languages and cultural identities. Since the presentation of its first NDC in 2015, the country has acted upon its commitments regarding adaptation, addressing local vulnerability in order to protect its biological and cultural diversity and richness.</p>
<p>In recent decades, knowledge on vulnerability to climate change, thus reaffirming that adaptation and the reduction of risks to the population, ecosystems and productive sectors are not deferrable deeds.. The interaction of factors such Mexico’s position, environmental and socioeconomic conditions, along with a high social inequality, results in a country that is highly vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Recent studies, as well as the analysis of the information presented in special reports by the IPCC, provide solid ground for the construction of a National Adaptation Policy (NAP) foreseen by the LGCC whose objective is to guide the implementation of this component through collaborative, multi-sectoral processes that recognize the comprehensive, complex and urgent<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
 nature of adaptation.</p>
<p>This component expands its scope by integrating cross-cutting elements such as Nature-based Solutions (NBS) and Community-Based Adaptation (CBA) approaches; Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA); as well as Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) based Adaptation. The NDC is strengthened by incorporating the results of a nationwide participatory process, which considered all three orders of government,specialists, scholars, productive sectors, social organizations, youth and the public. Additional elements were included to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the country's population, its ecosystems as well as its strategic infrastructure and tangible cultural heritage. Consequently, the adaptation component increases its scope of action.</p>
<p>While defining actions included in this component, particular attention was given to identify the necessary means of implementation. This resulted in actions pertaining capacity building, knowledge generation, scientific research and education, technological transfer and development, as well as the consolidation of financial mechanisms required by adaptation actions that will be implemented during the period leading to 2030.</p>
<p>Consequently, this NDC update presents a greater ambition in the actions that will be undertaken in the territory and foresees the consolidation of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) mechanisms which will enhance the System for Information on Advances in Transparency (SIAT) of the Nationally Determined Contribution (SIAT – NDC). These actions will reinforce reporting mechanisms and provide further insights and transparency of the progress towards the reduction of vulnerability. This framework considers increased participation of different sectors and organizations involved in decision making and planning, thereby optimizing the use of. This, by recognizing opportunities and establishing requirements for adequate implementation with a long-term perspective.</p>
<p>The following sections present the five general axes included in the component and describe the 27 action lines identified in order to decrease the country’s vulnerability.</p>

<p><img src="MEX-NDC1_50.png"/></p>
<h3>AXIS A. PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT
OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE HUMAN
POPULATION AND THE TERRITORY</h3>


<p>In Mexico, several social groups are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Among them are indigenous and Afro-Mexican communities, the vast majority of whom live in impoverished, highrisk areas. On the other hand, the inequality that persists in Mexico, further stresses geographical vulnerability as well as age and gender disparities. Restricting women's access to means of production such as land, financing, training, education and information, all of which diminishes their adaptive capacity in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>These social and economic conditions, coupled with the increase of adverse hydro-meteorological phenomena, such as flooding and droughts, have forced people to leave their homes and seek new opportunities in other territories. These processes sometimes lead to conflicts and competition for resources that can aggravate pre-existing vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Axis A</strong> is composed of seven lines of action whose main objective is to ensure the implementation of actions in the territory. It addresses the gaps in social inequality and aims to reduce the impacts associated with climate change by raising awareness among the population, providing access to information and developing tools for decision-making. This axis considers a preventive, long-term approach.</p>
<p>This section contributes towards the fulfillment of strategic issues related to 15 SDGs and 45 of its goals. Amongst the most salient are the following: Cities and human settlements adopting and implementing comprehensive policy and plans for climate adaptation; resilience of personas in climate vulnerability and reduction of their exposure; preventive health, considering gender equality criteria intersectionality and human rights, to mention a few elements.</p>


<p>The following table features actions, highlighting new commitments, existing synergies with mitigation and, where appropriate, linkages with the SDGs.</p>

<h3>AXIS B. RESILIENT PRODUCTION
SYSTEMS AND FOOD SAFETY</h3>

<p>Food is a fundamental human right that is warranted when people have timely and permanent physical, economic, and social access to food in sufficient quantity and quality for adequate consumption. This right contributes both to their well-being and to the satisfaction of their dietary and cultural needs. In Mexico, the increase in temperature and changes in rainfall resulting from climate change may result in the displacement of traditional crops, which may become unsuitable for the region where they are currently produced. Similarly, the ecological structure and functions of marine ecosystems, as well as the goods and services they provide are expected to be altered. The conservation of agrobiodiversity, the battle against desertification and the reduction of overexploitation of land and marine natural resources, represent challenges closely related to food security.</p>
<p>Extensive cattle farming has important social and environmental impacts. The constant increase in the demand for livestock products accelerates the deforestation of large areas of forests and results in the pollution and depletion of water bodies. Furthermore, feeding and thermal comfort requirements for livestock, demand comprehensive strategies of sustainable management, such as the establishment of silvopastoral systems and regenerative cattle farming.</p>

<p>These considerations are addressed in <strong>Axis B</strong>, which proposes five action lines that support the fulfillment of 9 SDGs and 11 of its goals, related to the sustainability of food production systems and resilient agricultural practices that contribute to the maintenance of ecosystems and strengthen the countries adaptive capacity. It also address the fair and equitable distribution of benefits provided by genetic diversity and species diversification, as well as the adaptation of value chains and investment plans that integrate climate change criteria, fostering traditional knowledge that favors the reduction of inequality gaps, placing the rights, needs and realities of all people in a situation of vulnerability at the center of the processes of adaptation to climate change , encouraging research, development and application of scientific and traditional knowledge. The following table highlights new action lines, synergies, and connections with the SDGs.</p>

<h3>AXIS C. CONSERVATION, RESTORATION AND SUSTAINABLE
USE OF BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES</h3>


<p>Biodiversity plays a key role in carbon sequestration
and the regulation of the global
climate through the ecosystem services it provides. Mexico is the 5th most diverse
country in the world, home to approximately
12% of the planet's biodiversity.</p>


<p>A high percentage of the country's terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity is threatened by factors such as habitat destruction, over-exploitation of resources, air pollution, the presence of invasive exotic species and the adverse effects of climate change. The degradation and loss of ecosystems will increase the vulnerability of the population and biodiversity to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Human rights, such as the right to potable water and access to food, the right to health and a healthy environment are strongly dependent on ecosystems and the diversity they provide. This biodiversity is an intrinsic part of the traditions and culture of indigenous communities and, as such, it should be preserved.</p>
<p>In this sense, <strong>Axis C</strong> integrates crucial issues for the country based on the conservation and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, seas and oceans, forests, and key species. It also integrates actions to strengthen the management of Natural Protected Areas and increase their connectivity. Additional conservation schemes are considered based on mutual respect for the collective rights and common goods<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
 belonging to the communities that inhabit them. Through these actions, this section seeks to integrate resilience and development, ensuring synergies for the mitigation of GHGs. The following table highlights new actions, synergies, and connections with the SDGs.</p>

<h3 id="axis-d.-comprehensive-water-resources-management-with-a-focus-on-climate-change"><strong>AXIS D. COMPREHENSIVE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT WITH A FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE</strong></h3>
<p>Water is one of the most valuable resources required for the integral and sustainable development of the country. Life and health, as well as the balance of ecosystems depend directly on water. This resource is crucial for social and economic development. Having access to water in sufficient quality and quantity is a human right that serves as a precondition for the exercise of other rights such as access to healthcare, food, a healthy environment, adequate housing and education. The adverse conditions generated by climate change can severely affect the availability of this resource.</p>
<p>The availability of water in Mexico is threatened. At least 14% of water basins are currently in deficit and 16% of aquifers are <a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>
. Constant water supply and modern sanitation in households is not universal. In rural zones, this percentage is lower than in urban areas, sharpening this situation in marginalized areas. Social asymmetries, as well as gender inequalities, affect the availability and accessibility of water in sufficient quantity and quality.</p>
<p><strong>Axis D</strong> proposes four action lines to promote the integrated management of water resources and the improvement in the provision of services focusing on the most vulnerable communities. These actions, which will work towards 8 SDGs and 21 of its goals, address the following issues: efficient use of water resources in all sectors and sustainability of freshwater extraction and supply against shortages; capacity-building in activities and programs related to water and sanitation; promotion of climate technologies for water collection, efficient use of water resources, wastewater treatment, recycling, and reuse; protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems, including forests, mountains, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and lakes; value integration of ecosystems and biological diversity into national and local planning, as well as strategies for development and poverty reduction.

<h3>AXIS E. PROTECTION OF STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE
AND TANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE</h3>
<p>Strategic infrastructure provides the technical
means, necessary facilities, and services
for the development of essential activities.
Furthermore, it is a fundamental
framework to guarantee human rights to
health, security, physical integrity, well-being,
and sustainable development of the
population.</p>
<p>Mexico has a tangible cultural heritage
that includes both natural and cultural
goods that, due to their natural, aesthetic,
artistic or scientific value, contribute to
the Mexican identity. This heritage is composed,
on the one hand, of environmental
weatlh and assets comprising that include
natural areas, habitat and shelter of
numerous endemic species, and on the
other, of buildings, enclosures and archaeological
vestiges that contain a historical
legacy of societies that preceded the current
one.</p>
<p>The conservation of infrastructure and heritage
represents challenges that will be exacerbated by the adverse effects of climate
change. For example, energy sector
infrastructure is vulnerable to climate
variability, as severe droughts or rains can
affect the optimal functioning of power
generation plants<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>
.

<p>The four action lines of <strong>Axis E</strong> promote that the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of infrastructure review focused on strengthening its resistance to ensure the continuity of the provision of services. The main of this axis is to ensure the resilience of new and existing infrastructure, as well as tangible cultural heritage, going beyond the usual designs and promoting the development and incorporation of criteria for adaptation and identification of science-based risks to climate change that integrate traditional and innovation knowledge to increase the strength of the elements that make it up. These actions incorporate knowledge on the risks generated by climate change and seek to adapt to current and future realities, integrating traditional and innovative knowledge to increase the strength of the elements that comprise them.</p>

<p>Actions undertaken to protect tangible cultural heritage from the effects of climate change will consider the respect for spiritual or religious beliefs, as well as for the roles of women and men. They will seek to ensure the right to enjoy existing heritage and guarantee its accessibility and to promote the positive influence that culture, heritage and traditional knowledge provides for our society.</p>


<p>Through these actions, <strong>Axis E</strong> will contribute to 9 SDGs and 21 of its goals; reliable, sustainable, resilient, high-quality, affordable and equitable infrastructure to support economic development and human well-being; resilience of infrastructure in cities and human settlements by implementing integrated policies and plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as integrated disaster risk management; protection and safeguard of cultural and natural heritage; modernization of infrastructure and converting industries to become sustainable. The following table shows new activities, synergies with mitigation and relationship with SDGs.</p>

<h2> Mitigation Component </h2>

<p>Mexico is unconditionally committed to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 22% and its black carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 compared to a baseline under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. In addition, conditional commitments would allow for increased emissions mitigation, reaching a target of up to 36% reduction of GHG emissions and 70% of black carbon emissions by 2030 compared to the BAU. These commitments rely on the consolidation, at international level, of technology transfer mechanisms, an international price for carbon trading, adjustment of tariffs for carbon content, technical cooperation and access to low-cost financial resources, all on a scale equivalent to the challenge required to address climate change.</p>
<p>The projected BAU scenario to 2030, without any mitigation policy intervention, was quantified at 991 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e. The reduction of unconditional emissions by 2030 translates into a reduction of approximately 210 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e that year, while compliance with conditional commitments would imply reductions of an additional 137 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e. The implementation period of this NDC ranges from 2020 to 2030 and the policies undertaken are considered based on the information for emissions in 2013.</p>

<p><img src="MEX-NDC1_51.png"/></p>

<p>In order to update this NDC and strengthen the country's climate action based on the best available knowledge, working groups were formed with representatives from the public, private and social sectors, each of which collaborated in the development of specific studies for each sector of the economy reflected in the NDC. As a result, taking advantage of a shared responsibility and the best interest of the sector’s stakeholders, it was possible to identify the most viable initiatives for implementation, the best cost-benefit ratio, and the greatest opportunities for reducing emissions in the short, medium, and long term. These studies, known as implementation routes<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>
, have been fundamental in defining sectoral and programmatic action lines, as well as in assessing potential reductions in black carbon (BC) and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs).</p>
<p>Likewise, the NDC identifies the synergies between the adaptation and mitigation components, thereby promoting the reduction of barriers to their implementation in the territory and enhancing co-benefits in the short and long term. Mexico recognizes that both adaptation and mitigation are key elements for the consolidation of more climate-resilient trajectories and that enhancing these synergies will have an end-to-end benefit for the country's development and they may generate structural changes and modifications in production and consumption patterns. Similarly, strengthening the benefits of these synergies in the short term will contribute to a better allocation of financial and institutional resources<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>
 in the implementation of the NDC. Through integral and inter-institutional projects, conceptual elements will be generated to support transparency and reporting, which will shorten the conceptual gap between mitigation and adaptation contributing to science-based decision making.</p>



<p>Regarding the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Mexico has dedicated efforts towards the global objectives of poverty eradication, protection of the planet, protection of environmental health and of the population to ensure that prosperity reaches everyone. Consequently, the affinity of policies and actions towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been evaluated. While the NDC is composed of specific measures, it is the result of a comprehensive approach that supports additional mitigation and development objectives. The results of these synergies are summarized in the following table, which highlights the sectors, focus on black carbon emissions, synergies with adaptation and connections with the SDGs.</p>

<p>In order to increase the ambition in the implementation of the NDC, Mexico is developing a system of cross-sectoral tools to accelerate the implementation of the committed actions. Among these, it identifies policies to promote open innovation and environmental care, accelerate the adoption and transfer of environmentally sound and socially appropriate technologies for mitigation, prioritizing those that achieve the greatest social benefits. Also, training programs have been implemented addressing public servants, from all three spheres of government and the general public.</p>
<p>From the experience accumulated in Mexico in the implementation of climate programs and projects, as well as the results obtained in the sectoral studies of the implementation routes, it has been determined that one of the most important cross-cutting elements for achieving the committed goals is energy efficiency in all sectors, both public and non-public, nationwide. Through the progressive optimization of energy use, it will be possible to achieve efficient energy planning that contemplates a reduced energy demand.</p>
<p>The commitments adopted by Mexico require a timely and ample set of financing options, therefore a climate finance strategy has been designed and it includes participation of the national and international financial sector, which will allow for the coordinated targeting of resources on the country's top priorities. In addition, Mexico has made progress in the implementation of a variety of economic instruments, such as the issuance of green bonds, the establishment of a Carbon Tax and the Emissions Trading System.</p>

<p>Finally, with the aim of ensuring environmental integrity and transparency, a sound accounting of implemented actions will be undertaken by means of the System of Information for the Transparency Agenda or SIAT, for both the Special Program on Climate Change and the NDC. The results will be periodically evaluated by the Coordination of Evaluation of the National Policy on Climate Change, which will provide feedback on the actions that have been developed, in order to ensure that the designed transformational measures are progressive and can be gradually improved or strengthened.</p>
<p>The cross-sectoral approaches described in the previous paragraphs are set out in the table below and are complemented by actions and strategies that will strengthen the cross-cutting action of the mitigation component. Existing synergies with the adaptation component as well as its relationship with several SDGs are included.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the activities percentages of mitigation goals commitin which it has been possible to identi- ted through the NDC. The detail of the acfy opportunities to implement actions tions will be developed in a NDC implethat will enable the achievement of the mentation roadmap and presented in the >Biennial Update Reports related to the contributions set forth in the LGCC<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>
. The following lines present sectorial areas of opportunity identified in the studies addressing implementation routes; these were defined based on the implementation roadmap and national priorities; they were established through a participatory process conducted within the framework of the updating of the NDC with the corresponding economic sectors.</p>

<h4 id="transport"> TRANSPORT</h4>

<p>This sector is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in Mexico, therefore, the implementation of policies and measures in this field will considerably support the reduction of associated emissions. The implementation routes and the participatory process identified opportunities regarding the strengthening of regulations applicable to motor vehicles, the encouragement of alternative transportation systems, the promotion of clean transportation programs, the development and implementation of the National Electric Mobility Strategy and urban planning oriented towards efficient public transportation systems.</p>

<h4 id="power-generation">POWER GENERATION</h4>

<p>The power generation sector is one of the most salient in GHG emissions nationally and globally due to the consumption of fossil fuels for the production of electrical and thermal energy. Through actions that increase the participation of clean energy in the national electric network, the strengthening and optimization of existing infrastructure and the promotion of innovative technologies in the areas of storage and smart grids, the energy sector will be constantly innovating to achieve the mitigation levels established by the LGCC.</p>

<h4 id="residential-and-commercial">RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL</h4>
<p>The sector has been one of the most dynamic over the last few years in terms of the implementation of mitigation measures. From the actions undertaken since the presentation of the first NDC in 2015, results have been achieved in multi-sectoral projects that optimize energy consumption in buildings and reduce the impacts of new constructions. On this basis, opportunities have been identified in the design of programs and actions at all levels of government to optimize energy consumption in housing and businesses, but also to promote mechanisms and regulations that encourage the inclusion of best practices in constructions and renovations, such as the strengthening of distributed generation.</p>
<h4>OIL AND GAS</h4>
<p>Emissions in this sector include the production, transportation, distribution, processing, and refining of hydrocarbons in the country. Based on consultation processes and the transversalities of the NDC, actions that will promote the optimization of the processes of the refining and processing systems have been identified, including the implementation of the Methane Emissions Reduction Policy.</p>
<h4 id="industry"> INDUSTRY</h4>


<p>Public and private industrial activity in Mexico is of great relevance, not only as an economic engine but also as a source of employment for a large part of the population. Through constant and close collaboration with the many chambers and industry associations, considerable opportunities were identified for reducing emissions and increasing energy efficiency. The actions consider a systemic approach to industrial activity, encompassing the entire production system to promote a circular economy by recognizing the externalities of the processes employed and at the same time optimizing the use of inputs and energy required. These actions will not only have an impact on the reduction of emissions, but also on the economy and competitiveness of companies.</p>
<h4 id="agriculture-and-livestock">AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK</h4>
<p>The mitigation component is reinforced in the present NDC through the traceability of synergies with the adaptation component. The agriculture and livestock sector has been strengthened considerably through the coordinated and cross-cutting action of a number of federal agencies in close collaboration with state and municipal governments. In the implementation phase, agricultural practices will be designed considering environmental and climatic variables, which will allow their territorialization in the most vulnerable areas of the country, strengthening activities based on scientific knowledge, research and its application with traditional knowledge. The foreseen actions consider best agricultural and conservation practices, the promotion of agroforestry and agroecological systems, the reduction of agricultural fires and the promotion of bio-digester technologies for a sustainable treatment of livestock residues.</p>
<h4 id="waste"> WASTE</h4>
<p>In this area, the NDC addresses opportunities related to solid waste management and disposal activities. considers or foresees an increase in treatment of wastewater from both municipal and industrial sources. As well as other activities related to their final disposal, reuse, recycling, composting, and bio digestion.</p>
<h4 id="land-use-land-use-change-and-forestry">LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY</h4>
<p>Mexico maintains and strengthens the strategy towards a zero-net deforestation rate, which will be achieved under the National Strategy to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (ENAREDD+, by its acronym in Spanish). Likewise, strategies for the management and administration of Natural Protected Areas are strengthened through coordinated action among the different orders of government by means of ecological restoration projects that will allow the recovery of unused and degraded soils. As with agriculture, this sector has high synergies with adaptation, its impact on the lives of rural communities and biodiversity conservation should be addressed strategically, strengthening its positive impact on sustainable development.</p>
<p>The lines of action previously presented are the result of a participatory process with the productive sectors aligned with the instruments of environmental policy and coordination between the three levels of government that will allow diversifying the energy matrix and making efficient use and saving of energy, as well how to lead productive transformations focused on the well-being of the population and on the protection and sustainable development. Through these actions, the mitigation component aims to promote low-carbon economic development that allows access to structural changes and less carbon-intensive forms of production and consumption. The actions will have a system of constant monitoring and follow-up to ensure their effectiveness and to comply with the commitments of the Enhanced Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>In this sense, the NDC constitutes a fundamental path to articulate the climate actions that will allow the transition to a sustainable development model, which is one of the objectives of Agenda 2030 and to which the development priorities of our country are aligned. For its implementation, a roadmap is generated with those responsible, times, costs and financing options and compliance indicators.</p>

<td><p>Following Mexico's ratification of the Paris Agreement and its entry in force in 2016, the necessary legal adaptations were made to include the provisions of the Paris Agreement in the national legal framework, and the institutional frameworks for its application were defined. Thus, the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) was reformed in 2018 to establish the figure of "Nationally Determined Contributions" as the "<em>set of objectives and goals, assumed by Mexico, within the framework of the Paris Agreement, in matters of mitigation and adaptation to climate change to meet the long-term objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</em>", as set out in Article 3, section X of the LGCC. In the same Law, the commitment to reduce emissions established by Mexico’s NDC is stipulated as follows: "<em>The country commits to reduce in an unconditional manner twenty-two percent of its greenhouse gas emissions and fifty-one percent of its black carbon emissions by 2030 compared to the baseline. This contribution, assumed as a Nationally Determined Contribution, implies reaching a maximum of national emissions by 2026; and decoupling greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth, the intensity of emissions per unit of gross domestic product will be reduced by about forty percent between 2013 and 2030".</em></p>
<p>The Special Climate Change Program (2020-2024) is a planning instrument derived from the LGCC and is closely aligned with the National Development Plan (2018—2024) and the National Climate Change Strategy vision 10–20–40, as well as the sectoral programs of 14 Ministries of State. The National Climate Change Strategy, as it is described in the Law, is the basis of the Mid-Century Strategy that Mexico submitted to the Convention in 2016, which establishes the longterm approach for low emission development. One of its objectives is to identify and assess the actions of the Ministries that contribute to the reduction of emissions, ensuring that these measures are in line with Mexico's NDC emission reduction goals.</p>
<p>Additionally, the NDC identifies actions undertaken by the states to reduce emissions within their jurisdiction and will be registered by the Federal Government, who will supervise and quantify these actions through a monitoring system.</p></td>

<td><strong>i. Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a gender-responsive manner;</strong></td>
<td><p>Mexico has an institutional and governance structure established by the LGCC (2012), the National Climate Change System, (SINACC), designed to operate as the permanent mechanism for consultation, communication, collaboration, coordination, and coordination on national climate policy, which includes a series of institutional arrangements for its implementation. The role of the SINACC is essential for the interaction between the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC), which is responsible for conducting studies and research projects and providing technical and scientific support for climate policy decision-making. The Coordination of Evaluation, as the pluralistic body responsible for assessing national climate change policy; the Intersecretarial Commission on Climate Change (CICC), composed of fifteen ministries, as a space for coordinating the actions of national agencies and entities in relation to climate change; the Council on Climate Change (C3), composed of experts from the academic and social sectors who provides recommendations on mitigation and adaptation; the Federal Congress; state governments; and national associations of duly accredited municipal authorities. Several state level, some states replicate the federal scheme and included an Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change.</p>
<p>During this NDC’s update, government agencies and state governments were involved, along with the private sector and social organizations. Public and private discussions were conducted with representatives of each of the sectors included in the NDC, comprising human rights, gender perspective and youth associations. In addition, online consultation procedures were implemented, in order to engage society as a whole in the process of developing climate policy and updating the NDC.</p>
<p>The impacts of climate change affect people differently; the consequences of climate change are even more acute for people and groups in vulnerable situations.</p>
<p>Recognizing the legacy of a structural system that has systematically placed vulnerable groups, especially women, at a disadvantage, this NDC update is based on gender-responsive approaches that will contribute to a more just and egalitarian society by prioritizing the needs of vulnerable communities and promoting the inclusion and recognition of the knowledge of indigenous communities, under the principle of intergenerational equity.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>ii. Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as appropriate:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a) National circumstances, such as geography, climate, economy, sustainable development, and poverty eradication;</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Mexico is a federal, representative, democratic and non-religious republic, composed of 32 states: 31 free and sovereign states, and Mexico City. The federal states, in turn, are divided into free municipalities, each governed by a city council; there are 2 457 municipalities across the country.</p>
<p>Due to the magnitude of its gross domestic product (GDP), the country occupied the 12<sup>th</sup> position among the largest economies in the world in 2017. The country produces around 1.4% of the world's energy and is the fifteenth largest producer on a global scale. It is also the thirteenth largest oil exporter, with 2.8% of world production.</p>
<p>Due to its geographical position, in the southern part of the Northern Hemisphere, and surrounded by two oceans, the country is particularly affected by the impacts of climate change. The climate change scenarios estimated for the period 2015 to 2039 project annual temperatures as much as 2°C higher in the north of the country, while, in most of the territory, they could range between 1 and 1.5°C. A decrease of between 10 and 20% of precipitation is projected.</p>
<p>Mexico is exposed to the impact of extreme hydrometeorological events that put the lives of the population, their well-being and heritage at risk. These impacts increase the incidence and intensity of forest fires; they endanger the conservation of ecosystems, their biodiversity and the services they provide; it also affects the availability of water resources in terms of quantity and quality (water security). At the same time, climate change has negative consequences on the yield of corn and other key crops, putting food security at risk and it causes damage to infrastructure and human settlements limiting development opportunities in the short and medium-term.</p>
<p>The fight against poverty has aligned all public policies with the National Development Plan 2019—2024, whose main objective and priority is to increase social well-being.</p></td>

<td><strong>b) Best practices and experience related to the preparation of the nationally determined contribution;</strong></td>
<td><p>Mexico supports its NDC by means of a solid national climate change policy, framed under the LGCC, from which public policy instruments such as the SINACC, the CICC and its Working Groups derive. All of these have facilitated a broad public engagement process at the national level within the framework of updating and establishing commitments in the area of climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>Mexico held a citizen consultation process at national level, regulated by law, and including specialized and key groups to improve and promote climate action through social engagement and access to information. This process included forums and workshops with citizens, specialists, private sector, federal and subnational public administration departments, as well as representatives of youth associations, who contributed with information.</p>
<p>Mexico has the support of international cooperation agencies to share best practices and international experiences, in order to integrate the information within the national context, through capacity-building, knowledge and technological transfer. In addition, the information presented in the NDC has been updated in accordance with the latest reports published by the UNFCCC, considering the methodologies of the IPCC 2006 and the relevant updates of the information contained therein.</p>
<p>A strengthened component of adaptation to climate change is included, which reflects the country's priority to accelerate the processes of reducing vulnerability in the territory in order to promote the well-being of the population.</p>
<p>Mexico counts with the support of INECC, an institution responsible for generating and integrating scientific and technological knowledge and for evaluating national climate change policy, in conjunction with the academic and research sector, in order to provide the best available information to the processes of designing and implementing climate policy.</p></td>

Reducing black carbon decreases the negative impact on ecosystems and human health, strategic infrastructure, tangible cultural heritage, and productive sectors, including agro-ecosystems.</p>
<p>Mexico ratifies its commitment to integrate, in both the design and implementation of its NDC, gender and human rights approaches with the participation of subnational and local governments and cities, in addition to indigenous groups and local communities, social organizations, women's and youth organizations, the private and financial sectors, and other stakeholders.</p></td>

<td><p>According to the above baseline definition (see 3a), the BAU scenario estimates emission reaching 991 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030. The development of the baseline is the projection of the historical trend of key drivers of the different emission sources. For this projection, the updated methodological information of the INEGyCEI is employed. In order to include the emission trajectory at a national level, projections are developed for each sector, category and, in some cases, for each emission source.</p>
<p>The stages of the baseline development process to 2030 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of key variables: considers the variables that characterize the generation of emissions of greenhouse gases and compounds (GyCEI);</li>
<li>Detection of information sources: From which the necessary activity data is obtained to estimate the projections of energy consumption, production, demand, among others. The main sources of information, for the sectors of the identified gray agenda are: The Energy Information System of the Ministry of Energy; The Statistical Yearbook of Mexican Mining; The Prospects of the Ministry of Energy, The National Electrical System Development Program (PRODESEN) and reports and public documents developed by the different Boards and Industrial Associations; among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the sectors of the so-called green agenda, the sources of information consulted were: Long-term perspectives for Mexico's agricultural sector 2011—2020, SAGARPA; National Agricultural Planning 2017—2030, SADER; Fertilizer Outlook 2017—2021, International Fertilizer Association; Agricultural and Fisheries Information Service (SIAP, by its acronym in Spanish), SADER. Similarly, the feedback with key factors such as industries, boards, associations and diverse dependencies and organizations, represents a source of relevant information for the development of this work;</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity data projection to 2030: With the relevant information collected, the activity data projections are integrated by sector, category and in some cases even emission source, such as energy consumption, production, livestock, among others, that could be reported in 2030 from the base year 2013 under a BAU scenario. In this sense, for the development of the projections it was necessary to analyze the characteristics of each one, defining individually the most convenient route to estimate future values, being sometimes the result of applying an average growth rate considering a stable historical period of the activity data behavior, or, through indicators that associate the demand or production expectations, demand, growth or others with the requirements of the activity itself, always seeking to reflect, in a conservative and representative manner, the nature of each activity;</li>



<li>Emission estimates: The estimation of emissions associated with the projected data for each sector was made taking into consideration the methodological approach (emission factors, considerations, and parameters) provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Inventories, which was used to update the INEGyCEI;</li>
<li>Integration of the baseline: Finally, with the data on emissions from the baseline scenario in each of the applicable sectors, it is possible to integrate, at the national level, the 2014—2030 emission trajectory expected under a BAU scenario, with the starting point being 2013 with data from the INEGyCEI.</li>

<td><p>The reduction of GHG emissions that Mexico proposes to achieve by 2030 in the update of its NDC. It is ambitious since the NDC contains unconditional contributions and additional actions which take into account that Mexico is a developing country. It is appropriate to emphasize that Mexico is currently facing severe difficulties associated with the economic crisis, so endorsing our commitments and providing additional resources to implement new policies is an effort that is being made to allow more countries to join the increase in ambition.</p>
<p>The NDC is considered ambitious since it incorporates all the recommendations regarding means of updating the NDC and adheres to the methodologies developed by the IPCC, to the effect of the registration of emissions in the INEGyCEI. Likewise, national funding mechanisms and efforts have been developed in the context of the guidelines and recommendations of the UNFCCC and other relevant international organizations on the subject.</p>

Mexico's emissions represent 1.3% of global emissions, in such a way that the reduction of 22% in its emissions in 2030 translates into avoiding the emission of around 210 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in that year to contribute to the global goal. In addition, the country could reduce up to 36% if the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1) The Paris Agreement as a whole achieves greater global ambition led by the countries with the highest emissions and the greatest economic development; 2) Mexico obtains additional financial resources to increase ambition on a scale that allows for implementation projects and not only studies addressing technical or institutional issues; 3) the transfer of available technology is facilitated through international cooperation; and 4) progress is made at the international level on policies to establish an international price for carbon and adjustments on tariffs for carbon content. These actions could help reduce an additional 137 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2030 and would support the implementation of a more accelerated decarbonization pathway in the country.</p></td>
