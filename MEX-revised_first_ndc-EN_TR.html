  <h1>Mexico's NDC</h1>
<p>Nationally Determined Contribution 2022 Update</p>
<h1>Nationally Determined Contribution</h1>
<h1>Update 2022</h1>
<p>Secretary of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC)</p>
<p>PRESENTATION</p>
<p>Mexico presents to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change the update of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in accordance with the General Climate Change Law (LGCC) and Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, and in accordance with decisions 1/CP.21 and 4/CMA.1 and its Annex.</p>
<p>In this NDC, Mexico establishes an increase in ambition with new commitments to mitigate greenhouse gases and endorses its commitments to adapt to climate change. Based on the best available science, contained in the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is imperative that the international community increase its ambition to maintain the possibility of stopping global warming at 1.5ºC. This requires that global greenhouse gas emissions be reduced by 43% in 2030, and reach a peak in 2025. Likewise, it will require a 30% reduction in methane emissions, as well as other pollutants short-lived climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Considering the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, as well as the capacities of the countries, in light of the different national circumstances, Mexico has evaluated its policies and identified additional actions to be able to update its NDC with the greatest ambition in mitigation possible in 2030. Mexico contributes 1.3% of global emissions, therefore, to achieve the 1.5ºC goal, coordinated action and leadership of the world's large emitters are required. It is also necessary to increase the ambition in the support that developed countries provide to developing countries, mainly in terms of climate financing, and accelerate innovation and technology transfer for mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>The effects of climate change are already being felt in our country, and as the IPCC has documented, in all regions of the world. Mexico commits in an unconditional way to carry out comprehensive actions to reduce the vulnerability of our people to climate change and initiate an adaptation process. We hope that during COP 27, an agreement will also be reached so that the international community, mainly those countries that have contributed the most with historical emissions, can compensate the losses and damages associated with climate change that are already being experienced throughout the globe. Mexico is also committed to supporting, to the extent of our capacities, other developing countries to adapt to climate change, mainly our sister countries in the Latin American region. For our common home, we must act for adaptation on a global scale and mitigate the emissions that are the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Mexico endorses its commitment to the Paris Agreement and presents the update to its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) with an increase in climate ambition. The increase in the national goal for mitigation of greenhouse gases responds to a call for solidarity and international responsibility in which all countries must present renewed and larger-scale commitments to face the planetary climate crisis. This crisis demands a profound change in the prevailing economic model that has destroyed nature and positioned profit over man. Based on climate justice, we must build a new sustainable economic model that favors the poorest and most vulnerable, and that can leave a lasting legacy for the new generations.</p>
<p>Mexico has begun a far-reaching historic process, the Fourth National Transformation, in which we seek to redress past injustices and put an end to corruption, phenomena that have left more than 52% of the Mexican population in poverty. Climate change accentuates inequality, disproportionately impacting the poor and dispossessed, working women and men, indigenous and peasant communities, and migrants. Immediate attention is required in the national project to climate problems to reduce poverty and extreme economic, ethnic and geographical inequality. Consequently, Mexico has focused its public policies towards the eradication of poverty with an orientation that allows laying the foundations for a more balanced and fair sustainable development, following the premise established in the National Development Plan 2019-2024 of "not letting no one behind, leave no one out.”</p>
<p>Our NDC includes more ambitious mitigation and adaptation commitments. Mexico's mitigation goals and its higher ambition entail actions throughout the national economy: energy, transportation, waste management, residential and commercial sector, land use, land use change, and forestry; also in industry, agriculture and livestock and in the oil and gas sector. The efforts that our country is currently making to reduce climate change may also translate into relevant economic and political benefits for our nation.</p>
<p>We have studied all the measures in our NDC and the investments required are large, but they will result in greater benefits than costs. In addition, they will help Mexico to insert itself into the new low-carbon economy, and lead the transformation of global energy and agri-food systems that a world of net zero emissions requires. We are convinced that this transformation will allow the Mexican economy to be much more competitive and that it can be achieved in a context of just and sovereign transition.</p>
<p>For its part, the adaptation actions are articulated in 5 thematic axes: a) Prevention and care of negative impacts on the human population and the territory, b) Resilient production systems and food security, c) Conservation, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services, d) Integrated management of water resources with a focus on climate change, and e) Protection of strategic infrastructure and tangible cultural heritage. We have begun a bottom-up construction process for the adaptation policy, where people are listened to, indigenous peoples and their ancestral knowledge, women and youth, and seek to support solutions that emanate from the people. The adaptation process is in a way one of resistance and struggle, in which those who defend their spaces and territories must be empowered, their ways of life that are affected by multifactorial problems that are accentuated by climate change.</p>
<p>The Government of Mexico also recognizes its commitment to the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The climate and environmental agenda are intrinsically linked to inclusive development in which other dimensions of well-being such as health, employment, gender equality and innovation cannot be postponed. Mexico underlines that climate action must be respectful of human rights, and that it must monitor at all times and promote all rights for all, women, native indigenous and Afro-Mexican peoples, boys and girls, youth, migrants, people with disabilities , LGBTQ population, low-income groups, and seniors<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The national climate action of our NDC is enhanced by the synergies of the actions of the 2030 Agenda and is respectful of the fundamental human rights of all individuals.</p>
<p>The report on the progress of the implementation of the NDC will respond to the objectives and goals of the Enhanced Work Program of Lima and the Gender Action Plan of the UNFCCC and, as a signatory of the Escazú Agreement, in adherence to the objectives of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, under the principle of equal rights between women and men and the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</p>
<p>In order to meet the mandate to promote the participation and consultation of the population in the construction of the NDC, during 2020 and 2022, a participatory process was carried out at the national level in which the Secretaries of State, through the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change (CICC), as well as state governments, members of academia, civil society organizations, the private sector, and the general public. Within this last group, the participation of young people who demonstrated leadership and a growing commitment to addressing climate change stands out. This was reflected in their active participation in dialogues that allowed their concerns and proposals to be included in this document. Additionally, as a result of this process, the NDC reinforces the means of implementation to meet objectives of development of science and technology, promotion of research, education, training, social awareness, access to information and citizen participation in a framework of innovation. constant technology to achieve territorialization and full appropriation of adaptation and mitigation actions.</p>
<p>The Mexican State has strengthened the means and mechanisms to implement its climate policy and the NDC itself, which has been incorporated into the LGCC. Likewise, it has taken firm steps to integrate and execute actions that address climate change in programs, projects, and actions in the different levels of government that will serve as reinforced implementation mechanisms of the NDC.</p>
<p>In this context, Mexico, as a middle-income developing country, is committed to promoting South-South and triangular cooperation, to support other countries to achieve more ambitious adaptation and mitigation goals in accordance with national priorities for each country. It will prioritize scientific and technological cooperation, the promotion of research for adaptation and mitigation, as well as the creation of capacities and considering its strategic position, the country will work to develop links with Latin America and the Caribbean to promote regional development.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mexico recognizes that climate cooperation and financing are tools that allow accelerating the implementation of its commitments and expresses interest in the cooperative approaches established in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to increase its ambition.</p>
<p>Mitigation component</p>
<p>Our Nationally Determined Contribution on mitigation with a higher level of ambition establishes the following goals:</p>
<h4>Mexico increases its goal of reducing greenhouse gases from 22% to 35% in 2030, with respect to its baseline, with national resources that will contribute at least 30% and 5% with international cooperation and financing planned for clean energy.</h4>
<h4>Conditionally, Mexico can increase its goal for 2030 up to 40%, with respect to its baseline in 2030, if international financing, innovation and technology transfer are scaled up, and if other countries, mainly the largest emitters, they make efforts commensurate with the most ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement.</h4>
<h4>Finally, the goal of reducing black carbon emissions by 51% unconditionally in 2030, and 70% conditionally, is ratified.</h4>
<p>The trend scenario projected to 2030, without mitigation policy intervention, was quantified at 991 MtCO2e as a reference point for 2030. It is specified that this reference point is 1.8% higher than that established in 2015 in the iNDC due to methodological improvements derived from the update of the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas and Compound Emissions, which was updated with the IPCC 2006 methodologies and its 2019 Refinement<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The application of methodological improvements makes it possible to support national goals with the best scientific information available.</p>
<p>The 35% reduction in emissions by 2030 implies 347 MtCO2e reduced in that year, while compliance with conditional commitments amounts to 397 MtCO2e. The implementation period of the NDC is from 2020 to 2030, and the policies implemented as of 2013 are considered, after the publication of the General Law on Climate Change of Mexico. This goal would contribute to reducing the intensity of emissions per unit of gross domestic product by around forty percent between 2013 and 2030.</p>
<p>Mexico will make efforts so that its emissions reach a peak as soon as possible, and studies of long-term decarbonization trajectories will be developed<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Below is a general description of the measures at the sectoral level that are considered in Mexico's NDC.</p>
<h2>LAND USE, LAND USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY</h2>
<p>Nature-based solutions are at the heart of our NDC compliance. Mexico will increase its actions and the channeling of resources as a priority for the conservation of its ecosystems, and for the development of programs based on a supportive and sustainable economy, which encourage the participation of men and women in the recovery of our biocultural capital, of the forests, of the biodiversity of Mexico, and that at the same time that they capture carbon and generate greater well-being for the population in our country.</p>
<p>The priority given to <strong>Nature-Based Solutions</strong> also stems from a broad recognition of the synergies that exist between mitigation and adaptation to climate change; ecosystem-based adaptation is essential to increase the resilience of our communities and to ensure respect and conservation of their ways of life.</p>
<p>Mexico will continue to implement its <strong>National Strategy for the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (ENAREDD+),</strong> and reaffirms its commitment to achieving a net zero deforestation rate goal. Likewise, the strengthened NDC proposes ambitious goals to increase Natural Protected Areas (ANPs). Our country seeks to decree more than 2 million hectares (ha) of new ANPs, 1 million ha in Areas Voluntarily Destined for Conservation, and 40,785 ha for restoration.</p>
<p>In addition, Mexico promotes the <strong>Sembrando Vida Program</strong>, which already covers 22 federal entities benefiting peasant men and women throughout the country, promoting agroforestry, cornfields interspersed with fruit trees with actions agroecological, and diversifying the economy of the communities that need it most. The program includes the creation of Campesino Learning Centers, in which the necessary technical and financial capacity is created in the communities for a productive paradigm shift and strengthening of the social fabric.</p>
<p>Finally, the increase in ambition contemplates <strong>a National Blue Carbon Strategy</strong>, in which our country will work to protect mangroves, sea grasses and national marshes, an important carbon reservoir in our country which is currently threatened by unsustainable economic activities. Mexico is the 12th country with the greatest resources and marine-coastal ecosystems. It has: 775,555 hectares of mangroves, 400,000 hectares of sea grass, and 133,000 hectares of marshes.</p>
<h2>TRANSPORTATION</h2>
<p>The transport sector in our country is one of the main sources of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants. The latter, in addition to contributing to global warming, generate significant impacts on the health of the population, which is why the LGCC has prioritized their mitigation. Our NDC contains an expanded ambition in the transport sector, following the commitments established at COP 26, in Glasgow, in which Mexico will accelerate efforts, in coordination with the private sector and the country's cities, for electric mobility.</p >
<p>In this sense, Mexico is working to consolidate a <strong>National Electric Mobility Strategy</strong> to achieve these objectives and to implement fair and safe mechanisms, in addition to primarily promoting transformation in public transport, since which is the sector with the greatest social impact.</p>
<p>In addition, our government has decreed <strong>lithium as a strategic mineral</strong>, and has established the decentralized public body called Lithium for Mexico, whose objective is the exploration, exploitation, benefit and use of lithium, located in national territory, as well as the administration and control of the economic value chains of said mineral. This seeks to guarantee the energy sovereignty of the Nation over lithium and other minerals that are strategic and necessary for the energy transition, technological innovation and national development. All this in full compliance with the protection of the environment and the rights of native peoples, indigenous and Afro-Mexican communities.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting electromobility, regulations regarding vehicle energy efficiency will be strengthened, both for light and heavy vehicles, to reduce the carbon footprint of the vehicle fleet, and promote the transition towards <strong>more efficient vehicles</strong>, as well as the promotion of <strong>clean transportation programs</strong>.</p>
<p>Among the necessary measures, in addition to new electrical technologies and regulations, Mexico contemplates the expansion and rehabilitation of the national <strong>railway network</strong>. The promotion of rail transport allows reducing GHG emissions, due to its greater energy efficiency when transporting goods and/or people.</p>
<p>Another innovative measure that is included in our NDC refers to a <strong>National Remote Work Strategy</strong> that is promoted collaboratively with industries and authorities to capitalize on the lessons learned from the confinement due to the COVID pandemic 19, workers are supported to carry out their work in this modality. Remote work or teleworking contributes to reducing the carbon footprint, as well as other atmospheric pollutants, which strengthens climate change policies and also those of air quality.</p>
<p>Finally, the strategy for the transport sector entails an improvement in the linkage of <strong>urban planning with climate change criteria</strong> and recovery of public space for pedestrians, considering a system-oriented planning efficient public transport and alternative and non-motorized transport systems.</p>
<p>All these actions support compliance with the GHG target and are also essential for the <strong>black carbon target</strong>.</p>
<h2>ELECTRICITY GENERATION</h2>
<p>To comply with the climate change policy, the Ministry of Energy helps with the monitoring of actions to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and compounds, through the <strong>National Electric System Development Program</strong> and the <strong>CFE Business Plan</strong>.</p>
<p>In particular, the country has measures in three major lines of action: <strong>a) the integration of clean energy in electricity generation; b) the substitution of fuels with a high carbon content by natural gas in high-efficiency plants, and c) the reduction of technical losses from the electrical network</strong>.</p>
<p>In the first line of action, the <strong>CFE Hydroelectric Plant Modernization Plan</strong> stands out through rehabilitation and repowering actions, change of turbines and removal of silt, which aims to modernize more than 40% of existing hydroelectric plants, as well as building 4 new hydroelectric plants with a capacity of 284 MW. Likewise, it seeks to <strong>increase the generation capacity with photovoltaic, wind, and geothermal power plants and promote distributed renewable generation</strong>. In addition, the Ministry of Energy will promote new technologies for electricity generation, such as <strong>green hydrogen</strong> in hybrid power plants, among others.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting climate change goals, clean energy is promoted to support <strong>universal access to energy</strong>, for example, through rural electrification projects and a home pilot solar.</p>
<p>Our country will continue to be open to international collaboration, and will seek strategic alliances in full respect of national sovereignty, that promote renewable energy. In this area of international cooperation, the goal of integrating <strong>40 GW of clean energy capacity</strong> stands out, mobilizing climate financing, within the framework of the consolidation of a prosperous and sustainable North American region with the United States and Canada. An example of this is the <strong>Plan Sonora</strong>, already underway, which seeks binational collaboration with the United States, and with local actors, for the benefit of the people of Mexico, their environment and within the framework of the global fight against climate change.</p>
<h2>INDUSTRY</h2>
<p>Mexican industry is committed to the fight against global climate change, and proof of this is its active participation in the design and implementation of the <strong>Mexico Emissions Trading System</strong> (SCE ), the first in Latin America, which will regulate emissions from large industrial sources in our country. With innovative instruments, the aim is to establish a carbon price, which gives the necessary incentives for innovation and the necessary actions so that this sector can contribute to mitigation with cost-efficient solutions.</p>
<p>In addition to the SCE, our country promotes actions in micro, small and medium-sized industries, particularly through the <strong>NAMA MIPYME</strong>, which seeks to support cost-effective measures, mainly energy efficiency , to this sector of great relevance for the national economy and the generation of employment.</p>
<p>The increase in ambition also contemplates the development of a <strong>National Circular Economy Strategy</strong>, as well as programs and incentives for energy efficiency, considering both regulatory programs and the promotion of <strong>cogeneration efficient</strong> in industry, services and shops, and in sugar mills. There are multiple possibilities to promote a national circular and efficient industry, which includes collaborations and innovations of international scope, to generate greater competitiveness and a more sustainable use of materials, water and energy, with co-benefits in the reduction of emissions.</p>
<p>Finally, Mexico implements a <strong>National Cooling Strategy</strong>, as part of compliance with the Kigali Amendment, which promotes HFC reduction actions and participates in the <strong>Acid Climate Action Group Nitric</strong> (NACAG) for nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation.</p>
      <h2>OIL AND GAS</h2>
      <p>The oil and gas sector has a goal of 14% reduction in emissions and contemplates measures for its compliance that are grouped into three axes of action: <strong>a) the increase in cogeneration, both in gas processing centers as in oil refining; b) reduction of fugitive emissions from the gas and oil subsectors, and c) the Energy Efficiency Program in Petróleos Mexicanos and its production companies.</strong></p>
<p>Petróleos Mexicanos has established a methane gas exploitation goal of 98%, considering the production of existing and new fields, for which a <strong>Gas exploitation strategy in existing wells</strong> will be developed, and Priority works will be carried out in the new developments, with estimated investments of more than 2000 billion dollars. These actions are also essential to comply with the <strong>Global Methane Commitment</strong> to which Mexico joins with concrete actions. With the collaboration of the United States government, in accordance with the commitments of both countries in the fight against climate change and in full respect for the sovereignty of our country, a Plan for the implementation of mitigation actions in PEMEX will be designed.</p >
<h2>AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK</h2>
<p>The agricultural sector is essential in mitigation actions, livestock in particular is the third source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. Carrying out actions for the sustainable management of these activities is also essential for adaptation and food security. Thus, measures are planned to promote <strong>agroecological practices and conservation agriculture</strong> - among them the substitution of fertilizers, the application of bio-inputs, and <strong>reduction of agricultural burning</strong> - and Promote <strong>agrosilvopastoral systems</strong>, as well as measures for the <strong>capture and management of biogas from livestock waste</strong>, such as composting, biodigestion and daily treatment systems to avoid the generation of gas methane.</p>
<h2>RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL</h2>
<p>The measures in the residential and commercial sector present important benefits by promoting energy efficiency and thereby reducing the electricity bill in homes and businesses. Opportunities have been identified in the design of programs and actions in various levels of government that make it possible to <strong>optimize energy consumption</strong> and promote mechanisms and <strong>regulations</strong> that encourage the inclusion of best practices in new construction and renovations. The great impact of this sector on the population is recognized, so these actions must be reinforced with dissemination campaigns and a strong component of gender perspective.</p>
<p>In addition, the strengthening of <strong>distributed generation</strong> is promoted, which has great potential both in Mexican cities and in communities far from the electricity grid, where renewable and storage technologies present a valuable opportunity for universal access to energy.</p>
<p>In the same way, rural communities are supported to <strong>reduce the use of firewood</strong> and to have <strong>more efficient combustion processes</strong>, and thereby protect the health of the population, mainly women and children in rural households that currently have a high exposure to this pollutant. This measure is highly relevant to the achievement of the black carbon target.</p>
<h2>WASTE</h2>
<p>Methane emissions from the waste sector are an important source of GHG; but also, waste management in the country generates significant pollution problems in the locations where it is disposed of, as well as in bodies of water and oceans. From an environmental point of view, improving integrated waste management will bring multiple benefits in our country, in the health of the population and of the ecosystems.</p>
<p>The measures in this sector consider the <strong>improvement in the comprehensive management of municipal solid waste</strong>, as well as the <strong>treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater</strong>, and other activities related to their final disposal, <strong>reuse, recycling, composting and biodigestion</strong>. Progress is also being considered in the capture and use of biogas, both from sanitary landfills and from wastewater treatment plants.</p>
<p>The <strong>National Circular Economy Strategy</strong> will also include specific actions that improve the performance of this sector, and that are expected to bring important co-benefits, for example, through better waste management food and in the recycling of electronics and construction waste, which have a high mitigation potential if the life cycle analysis of their materials is considered.</p>

Thus, the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC) was reformed in 2018 to establish the figure of "National Determined Contributions" as the "set of objectives and goals, assumed by Mexico, within the framework of the Paris Agreement, in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change to meet the long-term objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention</i> for Climate Change”, in accordance with Article 3 section X of the LGCC In this same legal system, the attribution of SEMARNAT to prepare the NDC is indicated, with the support of INECC, and the CICC and C3.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Special Climate Change Program (2020-2024) is a planning instrument derived from the LGCC, and is aligned with the National Development Plan (2018—2024) and the National Climate Change Strategy vision 10 –20–40, as well as the sectoral programs of 15 State Secretariats. The National Climate Change Strategy provided for in the Law is the basis of the Half-Century Strategy that Mexico delivered to the Convention in 2016, which establishes the long-term vision for low-emission development. Among its objectives is to identify and follow up on the actions of the Secretariats that contribute to the reduction of emissions and are in accordance with the emission reduction lines of the NDC of Mexico. Additionally, there are actions to reduce emissions carried out by the federal entities in their area of competence.</p>

<p>ADAPTATION COMPONENT</p>
<p>Mexico is a megadiverse country with coastlines on both the Atlantic and Pacific<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> unique in its biological richness at the continental and marine-coastal level. In addition, it has a vast and diverse cultural wealth that translates into a wide range of languages and cultural identities. Since the presentation of the first NDC in 2015, the country has incorporated adaptation commitments, thereby reflecting the commitment to address its vulnerability and protect its diversity and biological and cultural richness.</p>
<p>In recent decades, knowledge about national vulnerability to climate change has advanced substantially, resulting in an evolution in the treatment of information and the application of approaches that are proposed and executed for the design of adaptation measures . The interaction of factors such as geographic position, environmental, socioeconomic and high social backwardness conditions in combination with cultural elements come together resulting in a country highly vulnerable to potential impacts of climate change, once again confirming that adaptation and risk reduction They are tasks that cannot be postponed.</p>
<p>Advances in knowledge about vulnerability, as well as considering the information presented in the special reports of the IPCC, provide guidelines for the construction of a National Adaptation Policy (NAP) provided for in the LGCC that aims to guide the implementation of this component through collaborative, multisectoral processes that recognize the broad, complex and urgent nature<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> of adaptation.</p>
<p>This component broadens its scope of action by integrating cross-cutting elements such as <strong>Nature-based Solutions</strong> (NbS) and <strong>Community-based Adaptation</strong> (AbC) approaches; <strong>Ecosystem-based Adaptation</strong> (EbA); as well as <strong>Adaptation based on Disaster Risk Reduction</strong> (AbRRD). Likewise, and as a result of a participatory process developed at the national level, between March 2019 and November 2020, feedback from the three levels of government, experts, academia, productive sectors, civil society organizations, youth and the public is incorporated. in general. Likewise, elements are integrated to promote the adaptation of the population, ecosystems, productive systems, food security, comprehensive management of water resources, and the strategic infrastructure and tangible cultural heritage of the country. In this way, the adaptation component increases its scope of action.</p>
<p>During the characterization of the lines of action, the required means of implementation were defined in terms of capacity development and strengthening, knowledge generation and scientific research, as well as the development and transfer of technology and the consolidation of financial mechanisms for adaptation actions that will be developed by the year 2030.</p>
<p>Consequently, the update of the adaptation component of the NDC presents a greater ambition in the actions that will be carried out in the territory and plans to establish and consolidate Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) mechanisms in order to strengthen the transparency in reporting progress and results obtained in vulnerability reduction. It also considers increasing the participation of the different sectors and organizations involved in decision-making, as well as in the planning and use of financing by recognizing opportunities and establishing requirements for their proper implementation with a long-term vision.</p>
<p>The following are the five axes and the 27 lines of action that reflect the commitment of the Government of Mexico to adapt to climate change within the framework of the NDC.</p>

<h2>AXIS A. PREVENTION AND CARE OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE HUMAN POPULATION AND</h2>
<h2>IN THE TERRITORY</h2>
<p>In Mexico, various social groups are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Among them, the indigenous and Afro-Mexican peoples who live mostly in high-risk areas and find themselves in situations of poverty and marginalization stand out. On the other hand, the inequality gaps present in the Mexican population increase geographic, age and gender vulnerability by restricting women's access to means of production such as land, financing, training processes or education and information, with which their adaptive capacity in the face of climate change is reduced.</p>
<p>It is these socioeconomic conditions, coupled with the increase in hydrometeorological phenomena, such as floods and droughts, circumstances that have forced people to leave their homes and seek new opportunities in other territories. These processes sometimes lead to conflicts and competition for resources that can exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Axis A is made up of 7 lines of action whose main objective is to move towards the implementation of actions in the territory. It takes into account the gaps in social inequality and is aimed at reducing the impacts associated with climate change through raising awareness among the population, access to information, and the development of tools and instruments for decision-making. Consider a preventive approach and a long-term vision.</p>
<p>Similarly, it considers contributing to the fulfillment of strategic issues related to 15 SDGs and 45 of its goals, among which stand out: cities and human settlements that adopt and implement policies and integrated plans for adaptation; resilience of people in vulnerable situations and reduction of their climate exposure and vulnerability; and preventive health, considering criteria of gender equality, intersectionality and human rights, to name a few.</p>
<p>The following table shows the corresponding lines of action, highlighting new actions, existing synergies with mitigation and, where appropriate, the link with the SDGs.</p>

<p>AXIS B. RESILIENT PRODUCTION SYSTEMS</p>
<p>AND FOOD SAFETY</p>
<p>Food is a fundamental human right that is guaranteed when people enjoy timely and permanent physical, economic, and social access to food in sufficient quantity and quality for adequate consumption. This right contributes both to their well-being and to the satisfaction of nutritional and cultural needs. In Mexico, the increase in temperature and changes in rainfall patterns, as a result of climate change, could make many crops unsuitable for the region where they are currently grown. Likewise, effects on the ecological structure and the functioning of marine ecosystems are foreseen, as well as on the goods and services they provide. In these scenarios, it is recognized that the conservation of agrobiodiversity, the fight against desertification and the reduction of overexploitation of terrestrial and marine natural resources represent a challenge closely related to food security.</p>
<p>Similarly, extensive ranching has significant social and environmental impacts. The constant increase in the demand for livestock products accelerates the deforestation of large extensions of forests and has as a consequence the contamination and depletion of bodies of water. Likewise, in a context of climate change, the feeding and thermal comfort requirements of livestock will require comprehensive sustainable management strategies such as the establishment of silvopastoral systems and regenerative livestock.</p>
<p>In view of this scenario, Axis B proposes 5 lines of action that primarily support compliance with 9 SDGs and 11 of their goals, related to the sustainability of food production systems and resilient agricultural practices that contribute to the maintenance of ecosystems and strengthen the capacity to adapt to climate change by encouraging research, development and application of scientific and traditional knowledge. The fair and equitable distribution of the benefits provided by genetic diversity and species diversification are also addressed; the adequacy of value chains and investment plans that integrate climate change criteria and sustainable technological development; and traditional knowledge that favors the reduction of inequality gaps, placing the rights, needs and realities of all people in situations of vulnerability at the center of adaptation processes to climate change. The following table highlights new lines of action, synergies and the link with the SDGs.</p>

<p>AXIS C. CONSERVATION, RESTORATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES</p>
<p>Biodiversity plays a key role in sequestering carbon and regulating global climate through the ecosystem services it provides. Mexico ranks 5th among the countries with the greatest diversity in the world, hosting approximately 12% of the planet's biodiversity. A high percentage of the country's terrestrial and aquatic biological diversity is threatened by factors such as habitat destruction, overexploitation of resources, soil, water and air pollution; the presence of invasive alien species and the adverse effects of climate change. The degradation and loss of ecosystems will increase the vulnerability of the population and biodiversity to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Human rights, such as the right to drinking water and food, the right to health and a healthy environment, strongly depend on ecosystems and the diversity found within them. This biodiversity, in the case of native peoples, is an intrinsic part of culture and traditional knowledge.</p>
<p>In this sense, Axis C integrates priority issues for the country based on the conservation and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, seas and oceans, forests and priority species, among others. It also integrates actions to strengthen the management and increase the connectivity of Protected Natural Areas and other conservation schemes under climate change scenarios with respect to collective rights and common goods<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> of the communities that inhabit them. Through these actions, the aim is to increase resilience and development, ensuring synergies for the mitigation of GyCEI.</p>
<p>The foregoing is expressed in 7 lines of action that contribute primarily to the achievement of 11 SDGs and 32 of its goals oriented to issues such as: reducing the degradation of natural habitats, stopping the loss of biological diversity and the protection of endangered species;</p>
<p>conservation of ecosystems and their biological diversity for sustainable development; and promote actions to counteract desertification, rehabilitate degraded lands and soils. This table also highlights new actions, synergies and links with the SDGs.</p>

<p>AXIS D. INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WITH A CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS</p>
<p>Water is one of the most valuable resources for the integral and sustainable development of the country. Life and health depend directly on water resources, as well as the balance of ecosystems, the development of society and sectors of the economy. Having access to water in sufficient quality and quantity is a human right that serves as a precondition for the exercise of other rights such as health, food, a healthy environment, decent housing and education, among others. The adverse conditions generated by climate change can severely affect the exercise of this human right.</p>
<p>The availability of water in our country is threatened. At least 14% of the hydrological basins are in deficit and 16% of the aquifers are overexploited<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Additionally, the daily water supply and sanitation service inside the home does not have universal coverage. In rural areas, this percentage is lower than in urban areas, with this situation worsening in marginalized areas. Social asymmetries, as well as gender inequalities, affect the availability and accessibility of water in sufficient quantity and quality.</p>
<p>In view of this scenario, Axis D proposes 4 lines of action to promote the integrated management of water resources and the improvement in the provision of services from the perspective of climate change, which will contribute to the achievement of 8 SDGs and 21 of its goals, in which the following themes are observed: efficient use of water resources in all sectors and sustainability of the extraction and supply of fresh water in the face of scarcity; capacity building in activities and programs related to water and sanitation; promoting research and technological development, promoting climate technologies for water collection, efficient use of water resources, wastewater treatment , recycling and reuse; protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems, including forests, mountains, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and lakes; integration of the value of ecosystems and biological diversity in national and local planning, as well as strategies for development and poverty reduction. The following table shows the new actions, the synergies and the link with the SDGs.</p>

<p>AXIS E. PROTECTION OF STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND CULTURAL HERITAGE</p>
<p>TANGIBLE</p>
<p>The strategic infrastructure provides the technical means, necessary facilities and services for the development of essential activities. In the same way, it represents a fundamental support to guarantee the human rights to health, safety, physical integrity, well-being and sustainable development of the country.</p>
<p>Mexico has a tangible cultural heritage that includes both natural and cultural assets that, due to their natural, aesthetic, artistic or scientific value, contribute to the Mexican identity. This heritage is made up, on the one hand, of environmental assets and riches that include natural areas that are the habitat and shelter of numerous species, many of them endemic, and on the other, of buildings, enclosures and archaeological remains that concentrate a historical legacy of the societies that precede the current one.</p>
<p>The conservation of strategic infrastructure and heritage represents inherent challenges that will be exacerbated by the adverse effects of climate change. For example, the infrastructure of the energy sector is vulnerable to climate variability, since droughts or severe rains can affect the optimal functioning of hydroelectric generation<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, among others.</p>
<p>In response to the above, the four lines of action of Axis E promote that the planning, design, construction, maintenance and operation of the infrastructure are focused on strengthening its resistance to ensure the continuity of the provision of services. This has as its main objective to ensure the resilience of new and existing infrastructure, as well as tangible cultural heritage, going beyond the usual designs and promoting the development and incorporation of adaptation criteria and identification of risks to climate change based on science that integrate traditional knowledge and innovation to increase the strength of the elements that make it up.</p>
<p>In particular, for actions that address the protection of tangible cultural heritage from the effects of climate change, respect for spiritual or religious beliefs will be considered, as well as the roles of women and men, seeking to ensure the right to enjoy cultural heritage and guarantee its access; In the same way, the positive potential of culture, heritage and traditional knowledge and the enjoyment of cultural rights will be considered.</p>
<p>The above will contribute, above all, to complying with 9 SDGs and 21 of their goals, highlighting issues such as: reliable, sustainable, resilient, quality infrastructures and affordable and equitable access, to support economic development and human well-being ; infrastructure resilience in cities and human settlements, implementing integrated policies and plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as comprehensive disaster risk management; protect and safeguard the cultural and natural heritage; and modernize infrastructure and reconvert industries to make them sustainable. The following table shows the new activities, the synergies with mitigation and the link with the SDGs.</p>
