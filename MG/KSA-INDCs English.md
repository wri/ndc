The Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the 

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the UNFCCC 

 

Riyadh, November 2015 

The  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia  is  pleased  to  submit  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined 
Contribution  (INDC)  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change 
(UNFCCC) Secretariat pursuant to the decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20.  

The INDC of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on the principles listed in Art. 3 of the 
UNFCCC  and  the  approach  specified  in  the  Economic  Diversification  Initiative  adopted  as 
UNFCCC decision 24/CP.18 in Doha 2012. The Kingdom will engage in actions and plans in 
pursuit of economic diversification that have co-benefits in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emission avoidances and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, as well as reducing the 
impacts  of  response  measures.  This  will  help  the  Kingdom  to  achieve  its  sustainable 
development  objectives.  In  this  spirit,  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia  desires  to  actively 
contribute  to  the  UNFCCC  negotiations  maximizing  long  term  benefits  and  minimizing 
potential negative side effects for Saudi Arabia.  

 

Executive Summary 

The  actions  and  plans  outlined  in  this  submission  seek  to  achieve  mitigation  co-benefits 
ambitions of up to 130 million tons of CO2eq avoided by 2030 annually through contributions 
to economic diversification and adaptation.  These ambitions are contingent on the Kingdom's 
economy  continuing  to  grow  with  an  increasingly  diversified  economy  and  a  robust 
contribution from oil export revenues to the national economy.  It is also premised on the fact 
that  the  economic  and  social  consequences  of  international  climate  change  policies  and 
measures do not pose disproportionate or abnormal burden on the Kingdom's economy.  This 
is fully consistent with Article 3 paragraph 2 and Article 4 paragraph 8(h) and 10 of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 

A dynamic baseline will be developed on basis of a combination of two scenarios. One scenario 
assumes economic diversification with a robust contribution of oil export revenues, and the 
other  on  an  accelerated  domestic  industrialization  based  on  sustainable  utilization  of  all 
indigenous resources including oil, gas and minerals.  

 

I.  National Circumstances 

Physical,  economic  and  social  factors  determine  the  vulnerability  of  a  country  to  climate 
change and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia exhibits significant vulnerability in all three aspects. 
The Arabian Desert dominates the country, which spans approximately 2.2 million km2 of the 
Arabian  Peninsula.  Current  climatic  conditions  range  from  semi-  to  hyper  aridity,  with 

 
 

extremely  low  rainfall  (<150mm/year  in  most  areas),  high  evapotranspiration  and  resultant 
water scarcity.  In the long term, a significant share of the infrastructure on the coastlines may 
be vulnerable to sea level rise.  Trade and services may also be vulnerable to heatwaves and 
sandstorms  as  well  as  other  indirect  vulnerabilities  including  price  volatility  in  exports  and 
imports of goods and services. 

1.  Economic diversification is a key factor influencing the stability and sustainability of the 
growth of any country's economy, hence an economy's reliance on one income resource puts 
at risk its ability to maintain a level of growth in the long run.  Oil production, processing and 
export are the primary economic activities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, however there are 
opportunities for gas, minerals and their derivatives to contribute to the Kingdom's economy. 

2.  From  1970  to  date,  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia  has  developed  ten  5-year  national 
development plans (covering the period 1970-2019) to guide the development process for the 
Kingdom and provide economic and social stability in the medium to longer term.  Central to 
all these plans is the policy of economic diversification designed to diversify the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia's sources of national income and reduce dependence on revenues from a single 
source by increasing the share of other productive sectors in gross domestic product. These 
sectors include the manufacturing industries, energy and related derivatives, mining, tourism 
and information technology industries. 

3.  Two scenarios applied for determining dynamic baselines for the period 2000-2030 are 
differentiated into three time-periods.  First time period covers the years 2000-2015.  The year 
2000 is used because it is the year that most recent inventory data obtained using the Revised 
1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is available (second national 
communications).    Second  and  third  time-  periods  are  from  2016  to  2020  and  2021-2030 
respectively. 

3.1.  Scenario  1:  Economic  diversification  with  a  robust  contribution  from  oil  and  its 
derivatives  export  revenues.  Export  revenues  channelled  into  investments  in  high  value-
added sectors such  as financial services, medical services, tourism, education, renewable 
energy  and  energy  efficiency  technologies  to  enhance  economic  growth.    Ambitions 
outlined in this INDC are set under this scenario. 

3.2.  Scenario 2: Accelerated domestic industrialization based on sustainable utilization of 
oil and gas. A heavy industrial base built to use domestic oil resources as feedstock or energy 
source.  Increasing  contributions  of  petrochemical,  cement,  mining  and  metal  production 
industries  to  the  national  economy.    Economic  growth  will  be  much  slower  under  this 
scenario, and will be difficult for the Kingdom to finance its INDC ambitions with domestic 
resources. In this case, this INDC will be adjusted to account for this scenario. 

3.3.  The  main  difference  between  the  two  baseline  scenarios  is  the  allocation  of  oil 
produced for either domestic consumption or export. While exported oil will not contribute 
to the GHG emissions of Saudi Arabia, the domestic consumption will increase its GHG 
emissions.  For  the  ex-ante  estimations,  the  baseline  is  determined  based  on  differently 
weighted  combinations  of  the  two  scenarios.    Between  2016  and  2020,  Saudi  Arabia 
reserves  the  right  to  further  elaborate  on  its  INDC  and  make  additional  submissions  to 

 
 

 

account  for  these  scenarios.    During  the  run-up  to  the  validity  period  of  the  INDC,  the 
baseline scenarios will be updated. 

II.  Contribution to Economic diversification with mitigation co-benefits 

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has ambitious plans to diversify its economy away from heavy 
reliance  on  income  generated  from  a  single  resource.  Therefore,  contribution  to the  climate 
ambition will be integrated in the future policy to promote this plan. The INDC is thus driven 
by the aim to implement measures that accelerate the diversification process under paragraph 
3.1 above (scenario 1).  The following actions and plans will generate mitigation co-benefits 
and contribute to economic diversification: 

1.  Energy Efficiency: implement measures and initiatives that will promote, encourage and 
support actions in generating mitigation co-benefits in energy efficiency. Strengthen the Saudi 
Energy Efficiency Program and expand its focus. Currently, the program focuses on three main 
sectors, namely industry, building and transportation that collectively account for over 90% of 
the  energy  demand  in  the  Kingdom.    Support  initiatives  that  will  produce  far-reaching  co-
benefits,  such  as  the  introduction  of  efficiency  standards  in  the  building  and  transportation 
sectors  as  well  as  the  implementation  of  energy  efficiency  measures,  in  various  industrial 
establishments.  Encourage  and  expedite  the  conversion  of  single  cycle  power  plants  to 
combined cycle power plants.  

2.  Renewable energies: Invest and implement ambitious programs for renewable energy 
to increase its contribution to the energy mix.  The scope will include solar PV, solar thermal, 
wind and geothermal energy and waste to energy systems. A competitive procurement process 
for renewable energy is currently under preparation and evaluation. 

3.  Carbon Capture and Utilization/Storage: promote and encourage actions in this area. 
As part of its sustainability programme, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia plans to build the world's 
largest carbon capture and use plant. This initiative aims to capture and purify about 1,500 tons 
of CO2 a day for use in other petrochemical plants.   Saudi Arabia will operate on pilot testing 
basis, a Carbon Dioxide - Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2-EOR) demonstration project to assess 
the  viability  of  CO2  sequestration  in  oil  reservoirs  and  any  other  useful  applications.  Forty 
million standard cubic feet a day of CO2 that will be captured, processed and injected into the 
Othmaniya  oil  reservoir.  This  pilot  project  has  comprehensive  monitoring  and  surveillance 
plans.  The success of this pilot will determine the extent this program will contribute to the 
Kingdom's ambition in addressing climate change. 

4.  Utilization  of  gas:  Encourage  investments  on  exploring  and  producing  natural  gas  to 
significantly increase its contribution to the national energy mix. The success on realizing the 
Mitigation  co-benefit  ambition  in  this  area  will  depend  on  the  success  of  exploring  and 
developing natural gas. 

5.  Methane recovery and flare minimization: Actions will be taken to conserve, recover 
and reuse hydrocarbon resources and minimize flaring and fugitive emissions.  

 

 
 

III.  Contributions to Adaptation 

Saudi Arabia is continuously investing considerable efforts and resources in activities that help 
protect and renew the Kingdom's natural environment including protection of the biodiversity 
of land, seas and coastlines. Saudi Arabia differentiates its adaptation measures into those with 
mitigation co-benefits  and those that  are entirely  aimed at  adaptation  and  raising resilience. 
Adaptation measures can also contribute to economic diversification.  The INDC in this area 
is  driven  by  the  aim  to  implement  measures  that  will  enhance  resilience  and  accelerate  the 
diversification process of its economy under paragraph 3.1 above (scenario 1). 

1. 
Adaptation  with  mitigation  co-benefits:  The  following  adaptation  measures  are 
expected  to  have  significant  mitigation  co-benefits,  depending  on  their  degree  of 
implementation and availability of funds to pursue planned activities: 

1.1. Water  and  waste  water  management:    Implement  actions  that  will  promote  and 
encourage the reduction, recycle and reuse of water and wastewater in the municipal, 
industrial and commercial sectors in a manner that will reduce energy consumption, 
desalinated water production and unground leakage.  

1.2. Urban planning: Encourage actions that promote the development and use of mass 
transport  systems  in  urban  areas.  Take  the  necessary  actions  to  expedite  the 
development  of  the  metro  system  in  Riyadh.  In  addition  support  and  expedite  the 
planning and development of metro systems in Jeddah and Dammam. 

1.3. Marine  Protection:  Implement  coastal  management  strategies  that  are  designed  to 
reduce coastal erosion, increase the sinks for blue carbon, maintain related ecosystems 
and address the threats that climate change poses for marine livelihoods. Support the 
planting of mangrove seedlings along its coasts. In addition, strengthen and enhance 
the coral reef restoration program throughout the northwestern Arabian Gulf.  

1.4. Reduced  desertification: 

  Undertake  measures 

to  enhance  desertification 
management.  Support actions that will promote the stabilization of sand movements 
around cities and roads, while increasing sinks for capacity through using green belts 
as barriers.  Develop and enhance arid and semi-arid rural areas through various natural 
resource conservation activities, biodiversity and eco-system based adaptation efforts.  
The objective is to improve soil quality, water, pasture and wildlife resources through 
a  system  of  protected  areas  and  reserves.  Mitigation  co-benefits  may  include  those 
relating  to  reducing  land  degradation  and  improving  land  management  practices, 
especially for agriculture and forestry. 

Adaptation  undertakings:  The  following  adaptation  contributions  are  expected  to 

2. 
support Saudi Arabia's efforts to address climate change and raise resilience to its impacts: 

2.1. Integrated coastal zone management planning (ICZM): Take the necessary action 
to develop and implement ICZM plans that would take into account the protection of 
coastal  infrastructures  such  as  roads,  residential  areas,  industrial  complexes, 
desalination plants, seaports, etc.; 

 
 

2.2. Early Warning Systems (EWS): Develop and operationalize EWS that would reduce 
vulnerability due to extreme weather events such as rainstorms, floods and dust storms 
by increasing resilience of infrastructure; 

2.3. Integrated  water  management  planning:    Develop  and  implement  plans  that  will 
harness new sources of freshwater, construct additional dams for collection of drinking 
water and recharging of aquifers. 

IV.  Addressing Response Measures 

Saudi  Arabia  will  take  the  necessary  actions  to  understand  international  policy  measures  to 
response to climate change, assess the implications of these measures on its economy, and take 
necessary steps to raise its resilience to these impacts. International cooperation in addressing 
response  measures  is  important  for  the  Kingdom  to  achieve  its  sustainable  development 
objectives and realize its ambitions in addressing climate change; these include:  

1. 
Socio-economic research studies to assess the impacts of mitigation policy measures 
implemented outside Saudi Arabia on the Saudi economy, including collection of information 
and development of modelling tools. 

2. 
Research and development activities to provide technologies that enhance economic 
competitiveness.  Research into understanding the long-term impacts of response measures on 
energy market stability and to develop measures that can sustain a stable energy market in the 
long run. Technology cooperation on the basis of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 24-29 
in decision 5/CP.7 will allow for the identification of appropriate technological options, which 
are consistent with national priorities, and domestic human and financial resources in order to 
promote  enabling  environment  for  economic  diversification  and  technological  development 
(e.g. carbon capture  utilization and storage). 

3. 
The long-term aim of such measures is to achieve a growth of domestic industries that 
exceeds the loss of revenue from oil export triggered by decrease in fossil fuel consumption 
and market distorting actions such as fuel taxes, subsidies and incentives for all complementary 
sources of energy. 

 

V. 

Timeframe 

The assessment of baseline covers the period 2021 to 2030. As time progresses, this assessment 
will be expanded until 2050. Estimates and ambitions will be adjusted depending on the level 
of  development  and  progress  toward  economic  diversification  (as  outlined  in  paragraph  3 
above) as well as feedbacks from different sectors of the economy. 

 

VI.  Means of Implementation 

The  implementation  of  Saudi  Arabia's  INDC  is  not  contingent  on  receiving  international 
financial  support,  but  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia  sees  an  important  role  for  technology 
cooperation and transfer as well as capacity building for INDC implementation. 

 
 

1.  The  ambitions  set  out  in  this  INDC  would  require  technical  assistance  and  sustained 
capacity building efforts and upgrading of skills at the individual and systemic levels to support 
their implementation.  Saudi Arabia therefore looks for benefiting from all the assistance made 
available to developing countries in respect of enabling activities within the framework of the 
UNFCCC. 

2.  Cooperate on research programme on the impacts of response measures on international 
energy markets and economies of fossil fuel exporting countries, as well as success parameters 
of economic diversification initiatives. Moreover, such international cooperation should focus 
on  the  development,  diffusion  and  transfer  of  less  greenhouse  gas-emitting  advanced 
technologies including fossil fuel technologies.  

3.  With regard to adaptation, collaboration on the following technologies is seen as crucial: 
(a)  water  saving,  recycling,  capture,  irrigation  and  sustainable  management  for  agriculture 
purposes;  (b)  early  warning  system  against  meteorological  extreme  events  (such  as  floods, 
storms and droughts; and (c) transportation technologies that are resilient to the adverse effects 
of  climate  change  while  reducing  and/or  capturing  transportation-related  emissions.    Saudi 
Arabia  aims  to  create  long-term  partnerships  with  universities,  research  institutes  and  the 
private sector in order to enable utilization of these technologies. 

 

VII.  Monitoring and reporting progress on INDC implementation at the national level 

4.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia acknowledges that a monitoring, reporting and verification 
(MRV) system forms an essential part of its national arrangements for ensuring the successful 
delivery of its economic diversification and adaptation measures with mitigation co-benefits. 
The  Kingdom's  MRV  system  for  INDC  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  existing  and  future 
monitoring and reporting structures under the oversight of its Designated National Authority. 
The  MRV  system  will  be  deployed  to  track  progress  towards  achieving  INDC  actions  and 
projects and any modifications thereof. 

 

VIII.  Ambition and Fairness 

As a Party to the Convention, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's INDC is based on the UNFCCC 
and in particular, its Article 3 paragraph 2 and Article 4 paragraph 8 (h) and 10. Saudi Arabia 
is in the process of diversifying its economy. Being highly vulnerable to climate change and 
actions and plans to address it, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be engaged in several actions 
to address climate change and make its development more sustainable. The INDC's focus on 
economic  diversification  as  well  as  adaptation  actions  with mitigation  co-benefits  allows  to 
effectively address and tap on synergies for both responses to climate change. The ambition is 
also reflected in the high capital and investment volumes required for economic diversification, 
particularly if structural changes to the economy is required and to projects and actions outlined 
to implement the INDC. 

The contribution achieved through the mitigation co-benefits fulfils the requirement of fairness, 
given that the sum of these contributions leads to a significant deviation from a business-as-

 
 

usual emissions path for an economy that highly depends on oil and gas. The measures outlined 
in this INDC would achieve significant annual mitigation co-benefits estimated to be up to 130 
million tons of CO2eq by 2030.  The measures focus on harnessing the mitigation potential in 
a way that prevents "lock in" of high-GHG infrastructure.  These contributions would only be 
possible under scenario 1 pathway of sustained economic growth.
