Executive Summary 

Universally  eulogized  as  a  panacea  for  global  warming  by  limiting  the  global  temperature 
increase to between 1.5 - 2.0 degrees Centigrade, the landmark Paris Agreement will enter into 
force  on  November  04,  2016,  a  month  after  the  55/55  ratification  threshold  was  reached. 
Pakistan's  ratification  is  also  envisaged  before  the  22nd  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP  22)  of 
the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). 

As part of the international climate policy regime, national governments are obligated to submit 
their  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  to  achieve  stabilization  of  GHG  in  the 
atmosphere, with a timeframe that adequately allows for adaptation to climate change. Thus, an 
INDC essentially indicates a country's contribution to achievement of the universal target set in 
the Paris Agreement and the accompanying compliance mechanism at country level.  

Pakistan's  vulnerability  to  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  is  well  established  and  widely 
recognized. Despite Pakistan's diminutive contribution to global GHG emissions, it is among the 
top  ten  most  climate-affected  countries  of  the  world,  as  indicated  by  the  Global  Climate  Risk 
Index developed by Germanwatch. Moreover, these adverse impacts of climate change are not in 
the  distant  future  but  are  imminent.  Indeed,  these  are  already  occurring  as  Pakistan  has  started 
suffering  with  ever-increasing  frequency  and  ferocity  of  climate-induced  catastrophes.  Studies 
and assessments undertaken by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) show that 
extreme climate events between 1994 and 2013 have resulted in an average annual economic loss 
of almost US dollars 4 billion.  The last five floods (2010-2014) have resulted in monetary losses 
of  over  US$  18  billion  with  38.12  million  people  affected,  3.45  million  houses  damaged  and 
10.63  million  acres  of  crops  destroyed.  Likewise,  over  1200  people  lost  their  lives  due  to  the 
unprecedented heat wave in Karachi in 2015. 

The response of the Government of Pakistan to climate change is already substantial. In spite of 
the  country's  financial  constraints,  estimated  federal  climate-related  expenditure  was  between 
5.8 and 7.6 percent of the total expenditures in the federal budget last year. In the days to come, 
this  climate-related  expenditure  is  expected  to  increase  further,  primarily  due  to  the  likely 
increase in the frequency and intensity of the climate induced disasters. Needless to say, if there 
were no adverse climate change impacts, this budget could have been spent on education, health 
and poverty alleviation of the people of Pakistan. 

Pak-INDC (Pakistan's  Intended  Nationally Determined Contribution) is  rooted in  the  country's 
strategic plan ‘Vision 2025'. It is aligned with the respective policies, plans and sectoral growth 
targets  set  by  various  ministries  and  other  government  entities.  Similarly,  potential  impacts  of 
key  development  plans  and  projects,  such  as  measures  being  undertaken  to  address  current 
energy shortages and contributions to economic growth partly due to China-Pakistan Economic 
Corridor  (CPEC)  have  been  taken  into  consideration.  Pak-INDC  presents  the  overall  GHG 
emissions  profile  and  future  emission  projections,  by  considering  both  the  present  and  future 
socio-economic parameters, changes in the demographic dynamics and emerging energy needs. 
It also describes mitigation and adaptation measures already being implemented in Pakistan and 
discusses the challenges and difficulties being faced and those likely to be confronted in coming 
years. 
 

Based on the latest draft GHG Inventory of Pakistan (2014-15), growth in emissions of different 
sectors  has  been  fairly  consistent.  Over  the  last  twenty  one  years  (1994-2015),  the  overall 
increase  in  the  emissions  has  been  approximately  123  percent,  with  energy  and  agriculture 
sectors accounting for about 90 percent of total emissions. While the historical trend of increase 
in  emissions  has so far been fairly consistent, the envisaged  economic  growth and  increasingly 
conducive macro-economic environment are likely to amplify future emissions. 

Future  projections  for  the  period  2015-30  show  a  steady  increase  in  emissions  due  to  the 
ambitious  plans  of  the  present  government  to  spark  economic  activity  through  large-scale 
investments  in  energy,  communication  and  industrial  infrastructure.  The  forecasted  economic 
growth  is  considered  to  be  historically  unprecedented  and  unmatched.  Accordingly,  future 
emissions  of  the  country  will  increase  manifold.  Consistent  with  historical  trends,  both  energy 
and  agriculture  sectors  are  predicted  to  remain  predominant  in  GHG  emissions,  whereas 
significant increase is also expected in other sectors like industrial processes and waste. 

At a time when future emissions are set to grow rapidly, the country also offers a huge potential 
for mitigation in almost all sectors of the economy. Based on economic analyses, a reduction of 
up  to  20  percent  in  the  projected  emission  figures  for  2030  would  require  an  investment  of 
approximately US$ 40 billion, calculated at current prices. Similarly, a reduction of 15 percent in 
GHG  emissions  amounts  to  US$  15.6  billion;  whereas  a  10  percent  reduction  is  calculated  as 
US$  5.5  billion.  It  must  be  underscored  that  under  the  CBDR  (common  but  differentiated 
responsibilities)  principle  of  the  UNFCCC  Paris  Agreement,  the  indicated  mitigation  potential 
can  only  be  realized  through  international  support  in  the  form  of  financial  grants,  technical 
assistance, technology development and transfer and capacity building. 

Pakistan being  highly  vulnerable to extreme  climate events  is  into a state of forced adaptation. 
There is a huge potential for adaptation in Pakistan, particularly in  strengthening and fortifying 
the  flood  infrastructure  including  water  reservoirs  and  water  channels.  This  would  involve 
enhancing resilience of local communities to the adverse impacts of climate change. According 
to a national study, Pakistan's adaptation need is between U$ 7 to U$ 14 billion/annum.  

Low  abatement  cost  coupled  with  prospects  for  climate-resilient  investment  in  energy, 
infrastructure,  industrial  processes  etc.  qualify  Pakistan  as  one  of  the  promising  carbon 
investment markets in the world.    

In  consideration  of  projected  future  emissions  and  potential  for  mitigation,  Pakistan  offers 
different  options  as  part  of  its  INDC  for  emission  reduction,  subject  to  the  availability  of 
Finance,  Technology  Development  &  Transfer  and  Capacity  Building  by  the  international 
community. 

The  Government  of  Pakistan  presents  this  INDC  with  affirmation  of  the  principles  of  global 
climate  regime  and  hopes  that  the  Common  But  Differentiated  Responsibilities  (CBDR) 
principle will enable its people to enjoy a future that is much less vulnerable than the present. 

 
1.   National Context of Pakistan 

1.1. 

Introduction 

 

The Pak-INDC  Report is being submitted  by  Pakistan  in  compliance with its obligations  under 
the  UNFCCC  process  and  in  recognition  of  its  responsibility  to  the  comity  of  nations.  It 
demonstrates  the  country's  resolve  to  respect  the  COP-21  mandate  and  to  highlight  its 
commitment to addressing   the issues of climate change and associated challenges. 

Pak-INDC  broadly  articulates  the  major  challenges  faced  by  the  country,  which  are  likely  to 
intensify in future as a result of climate-induced variability and natural disasters. Actions already 
underway  for  reducing  GHG  emissions  and  adaptation  by  way  of  managing  disasters  and 
building resilience capacities are also enunciated. These actions represent Pakistan's contribution 
to  the  global  effort  towards  meeting  the  ultimate  UNFCCC  objectives  and  stabilizing  the 
concentration  of  GHG  emissions  into  the  atmosphere,  as  stipulated  in  Article  2  of  the 
Convention. 

Adoption of the Paris Agreement has further reinforced the ultimate objective of the  UNFCCC 
and  has  provided  a  framework  for  its  realization  in  a  more  intense  manner  with  a  long-term 
perspective.  The  global  consensus  on  limiting  temperature  increase  to  below  2  degrees 
Centigrade  is  an  endorsement  of  the  scientific  conclusions  reached  by  the  Intergovernmental 
Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC)  and provides safeguards for vulnerable regions  and countries 
of  the  world  from  irreversible  adverse  consequences.  In  doing  so,  the  urgent  need  for 
undertaking  adaptation  measures  by  all  groups  of  countries  has  also  been  underscored. 
Moreover,  it  needs  to  be  recognized  that  without  provision  of  adequate  finance,  technology 
development  and transfer and  capacity  building,  the consequences  for developing  countries are 
likely to remain catastrophic. 

Being one of the most climate-change vulnerable countries in the world, Pakistan's economy is 
already under severe strain from prevailing and likely future threats of climate change.  Adverse 
climate-related  impacts  are  draining  public  funds  from  essential  social  requirements  towards 
disaster management. The livelihood of the poor and the underprivileged segments of society is 
particularly at risk from the ever increasing exposure to natural calamities, such as flash floods, 
riverine    overflows,  heavy  monsoons,  cyclones,  droughts  and  heat  waves.  As  a  lower  riparian 
state situated in a semi-arid region, Pakistan also needs to remain watchful of the implications of 
its water-stressed situation.  

The  Pak-INDC  Report  presents  the  overall  GHG  emissions  profile  and  future  projections,  by 
taking into consideration both the present and future socio-economic parameters, changes in the 
demographic  dynamics  and  emerging  energy  needs.  It  also  demonstrates  mitigation  and 
adaptation  measures  already  being  implemented  in  Pakistan.  The  challenges  and  difficulties 

 
being  faced  by  the  country  and  those  likely  to  be  confronted  in  the  coming  years  are  also 
discussed.  

Efforts have also been made to undertake an assessment of economic and financial implications 
of  different  measures  which  the  country  shall  adopt  in  order  to  realize  the  mitigation  and 
adaptation  potential.  An  economic  analysis  has  also  been  carried  out,  in  the  form  of  sector-
specific abatement costs, which will allow framing of current and future mitigation measures in a 
measurable  costing  framework  and  also  enable  prioritization  of  forthcoming  mitigation  and 
adaptation actions.  

Pak-INDC  derives  its  strength  from  Pakistan's  Vision  2025,  a  major  policy  document  which 
provides  a  roadmap  for  national  development  until  the  year  2025.  Vision  2025  rests  on  seven 
pillars for driving growth and development to transform Pakistan into a vibrant and prosperous 
nation. It envisages adding 25,000 MW of electricity to the national grid by 2025, even though 
the  latest  estimates  and  policy  shifts  actually  necessitate  much  higher  energy  supplies.  The 
elimination of current energy demand-supply gap by 2018 and optimizing the energy mix of oil, 
gas,  hydro,  coal,  nuclear,  solar,  wind  and  biomass  are  some  of  the  key  priorities  of  the  policy.  
Guided  by  this  strategic  plan,  the  Pak-INDC  has  also  benefited  from  the  Government  of 
Pakistan's  National  Climate  Change  Policy  as  well  as  the  National  Policy  on  Disaster  Risk 
Reduction,  draft  National  Water  Policy  and  draft  National  Flood  Protection  Plan-IV. 
Additionally declared national policies on energy efficiency, alternative energy and other policy 
documents have also been referenced. 

Pak-INDC outlines a broad range of potential adaptation and mitigation measures. It also lists the 
challenges associated with the realization of these measures in both current and future scenarios. 
These  are  the  measures  that  can  lead  Pakistan  to  a  climate  compatible  and  low  carbon 
development pathway, provided adequate technical and financial resources are made available by 
global  partners  and  international  development  and  finance  institutions.  It  would  be  prudent  to 
stress  that  these  indicators  of  potential  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  and  adaptation  activities 
should  not  be  considered  as  an  international  obligation  of  the  country,  unless  the  resource 
provisioning is ensured.  Furthermore, our projected emissions, adaptation needs and abatement 
costs are based on present government's plans and actions, which may be adjusted and reviewed, 
as deemed appropriate.  

1.2. 

National Context 

 

Pakistan  has  a  total  area  of  796,095  square  kilometers  (sq.km).  It  has  an  Exclusive  Economic 
Zone  of  240,000  sq.  km  and  an  additional  Continental  Shelf  area  of  about  50,000  sq.  km. 
Bordering China, India, Afghanistan and Iran, Pakistan is one of the key countries of the region 
with unique geo-strategic and socio-economic realities. 

 
Multiculturalism  and  ethnic  diversity  are  important  features  of  the  society.  The  sizeable  youth 
bulge  offers  an  opportunity  for  accelerated  economic  growth  and  for  reaping  developmental 
dividend  if  required  investments  flow  into  social  and  development  sectors.  It  is  estimated  that 
about 1.5 million new jobs will have to be created every year to gainfully engage the youth, keep 
unemployment at a low rate and increase the pace of economic growth. 

With  current  population  estimated  to  be  195.5  million,  Pakistan  is  the  sixth-most-populous 
country of the world. Growing at a rate of 1.89 percent per annum, the population is expected to 
swell to 229 million by 2025 and approximately 275 million by year 2050. Aspirations for social 
mobility  and  search  for  better  opportunities  have  already  turned  Pakistan  into  the  second-most 
rapidly urbanizing country of South Asia with city dwellers accounting for 36 percent of the total 
population. In coming years this trend is set to grow further, resulting in a sizeable vibrant urban 
middle  class  despite  innumerable  economic,  social  and  environmental  pressures  in  the  already 
dense urban areas. 

Matching  economic  growth  with  population  increase  has  historically  remained  a  challenge  for 
successive  governments.  Energy  insecurity  has  been  another  stumbling  block  on  the  road  to 
improved livelihoods of  a large segment of society  and industrial  growth. The  government has 
therefore  initiated  several  programmes  of  financial  and  non-financial  support  to  various 
categories  and  target  groups  to  cater  for  social  and  economic  protection  of  the  very  poor  and 
vulnerable segments of society. 

At  an  average  economic  growth  rate  of  4.9  percent  from  1952  to  2015, current  gross  domestic 
product (GDP) of Pakistan stands at nearly US$ 284 billion. This classifies Pakistan as a lower 
middle-income  country.  Vision  2025  sets  the  target  rate  of  economic  growth  to  be,  on  the 
average,  seven  percent  until  the  year  2025  and  well  above  that  level  for  subsequent  years. 
Investments  in  power  generation,  energy  distribution  and  ‘China-Pakistan  Economic  Corridor' 
(CPEC)  will  provide  significant  boost  to  the  economy.  Several  large-scale  infrastructure 
investments,  energy  and  industrial  growth  projects  currently  in  the  pipeline,  are  expected  to 
further accelerate the targeted economic growth. CPEC alone is expected to trigger an additional 
GDP  growth  of  1.5  percent  from  2016  to  2020  and  a  further  1  percent  increase  for  the  period 
2020 to 2030. 

With  per  capita  oil  equivalent  use  of  just  482  kg  (including  traditional  biomass  fuels)  in  year 
2014,  Pakistan  is  one  of  the  lowest  ranked  countries  of  the  world  in  terms  of  energy  use.  
However, the country has remained crippled with an unending energy crisis that has negatively 
impacted  the  industrial  growth  and  severely  affected  agriculture  output.  The  energy  mix  of  the 
country shows a predominant share of natural gas, which currently stands at about 44 percent of 
total  commercial  energy  requirements;  the  remaining  comes  from  hydropower  and  fossil  fuels 
with a small portion from renewable sources.  Given the prevailing energy crisis and the need to 
meet  the  so  far  depressed  but  growing  demand,  the  country  needs  to  exploit  all  its  domestic 
sources of energy including coal, hydro, wind and solar. The use of nuclear and domestic coal-
based energy in the power generation sector seems inevitable in the future. 

 
Although  diversification  of  the  economy  has  been  an  unremitting  goal  of  successive 
governments,  yet  Pakistan  largely  remains  an  agrarian  country.  The  population  directly  and 
indirectly  associated  with  the  agriculture  sector  currently  stands  at  42.3  percent,  whereas 
contribution of the sector to the overall GDP is around 19.8 percent.  

The forestry sector, commonly considered as bearing a high natural capital value for the society 
and also a safeguard against climatic threats, has suffered heavily during the past two decades. A 
number  of  factors  have  contributed  to  deforestation:  prominent  among  these  being  poverty, 
population  pressures  and  lack  of  fiscal  space  for  strong  policy  initiatives  in  protecting  forests. 
The  current  forest  cover  of  Pakistan  is  about  5  percent,  which  is  extremely  inadequate  when 
considering  exposure  of the  country  to  future  climatic  threats.  Considerable  efforts  are  in  hand 
for  the  revival  of  forestry,  aiming  to  expand  the  forest  cover  through  mega  tree  plantation 
programmes and strengthening the regulatory & forest protection policy mechanism. The Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa Province's afforestation programme and the Green Pakistan Programme are other 
noteworthy examples of the country's commitment. 

1.3. 

Climate Variability  

Pakistan  is  well  known  for  its  geographic  as  well  as  climatic  variability.  A  high  altitude 
mountainous  region  with  several  peaks  over  8,000  meters  (above  sea  level)  and  deserts,  which 
cover about 11 million hectares, make 14 percent of the country's total landmass. The coastline 
in the south stretches about 990 kilometers. The country exhibits most differentiated altitudes as 
well  as  diversely  rich  geophysical  conditions.  Presence  of  about  15,000  sq.  km  of  glacial  area 
and  nearly  7,000  glaciers  makes  it  one  of  the  most  glacially  populated  regions  of  the  world 
outside  the  polar  region.  These  glaciers  are  considered  to  be  stabilizers  of  global  and  regional 
climatic changes, apart from being the most prominent source of water to meet the needs of the 
region. The rate of glacial melt in Pakistan, 2.3 percent per annum, has placed Pakistan amongst 
the fastest melting glacial regions in the world. 

Climate-induced disasters pose a  great  challenge  to  the economy.  Located in  a subtropical  arid 
zone, most of the country is subjected to a semi-arid climate. Based on physiographic factors and 
causes of diversity in climate, the country has been classified into four major climatic regions: i) 
the  marine  tropical  coastland;  ii)  the  subtropical  continental  lowlands;  iii)  the  subtropical 
continental highlands; and iv) the subtropical continental plateau. 

Pakistan's  contribution  to  the  global  GHG  emissions  is  miniscule.  According  to  the  Global 
Economy  rankings,  the  share  of  Pakistan  in  total  global  GHG  emissions  is  merely  0.8  percent 
and it is ranked as 135th in the list of global emitters on a per capita basis. However, due to geo-
physical conditions, climatic extremes, high degree of exposure and vulnerability etc, Pakistan is 
ranked number three in the 2012 assessment of the Global Climate Risk Index 2014 with over 6 
billion USD losses specifically due to climate change.  

 
Studies  and  assessments  undertaken  by  NDMA  show  that  the  climate-induced  catastrophes 
between 1994 and 2013 resulted in an average economic loss of US$ 3.99 billion per annum. The 
last  five  flood  events  (2010-2014)  alone  have  resulted  into  monetary  losses  of  over  US$  18 
billion with 38.12 million people affected, 3.45 million houses damaged and 10.63 million acres 
of  crops  destroyed.  Similarly  the  unprecedented  heat  wave  in  Karachi  in  2015  resulted  in  the 
deaths of over 1200 people. 

According  to  climate  models  suggested  by  the  Climate  Change  Vulnerability  Index  2016 
(CCVI),  monsoons  are  increasingly  becoming  erratic  both  in  their  spatial  and  temporal  nature. 
Similarly, drought events are expected to increase in winter, affecting the yield of cash harvests. 
CCVI  indicates  that  an  increase  in  precipitation  and  rainfall  pattern  will  happen  during  the 
summer  season,  resulting  in  riverine  and  flash  floods  over  different  areas  of  Pakistan.  On  the 
other  hand,  lack  of  capacity  for  flood  management  and  wetlands  results  in  discharge  of  extra 
water into the sea in less than a month's time, leaving the country in water-stressed situation for 
the large part of the  year, with  serious implications  for food  and energy  security.  Other hydro-
meteorological hazards such as glacial melt, glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF), avalanches, 
storms,  cyclones,  desertification  and  heat  waves  are  becoming  more  common,  putting  lives, 
property and the allied socio-economic features of country at great risk. 

The country is believed to be at the crossroads of economic development, offering a promising 
potential  for  mitigation  and  adaptation  with  a  favorable  opportunity  to  embark  upon  low 
emissions  developmental  pathways.  Fundamental  ingredients  of  development,  such  as  energy 
needs, food and water consumption levels, and infrastructure development and transportation and 
communication channels are expected to grow manifold in the coming years. Consequently GHG 
emissions  are likely to  witness exponential  growth, unless cleaner and  sustainable technologies 
can intercept the developmental trajectory and engineer the desired change.  

The government is consciously aware of the potential growth of GHG emissions and is devising 
its developmental strategy,  aiming  at  minimum  possible carbon footprints. A number of policy 
and action-oriented measures are already underway, especially to prepare for emerging threats in 
a pro-active manner.     

Prevailing Energy Crisis 

1.4. 
 

The prevailing energy crisis of Pakistan can be characterized in two ways:  

a) Lack of access to sustainable energy sources and products (energy poverty); and  

b) Power sector (electricity) demand and supply gap.  

The current energy mix of Pakistan is predominantly tilted towards thermal generation based on 
imported fuels. Over the years, this has created severe macro-economic challenges for Pakistan. 
The long-term solution to this energy crisis is now justifiably understood to be based on tapping 
into domestic sources of energy, including coal, hydro and nuclear for power generation, to the 
maximum  extent  possible.  For  this,  the  present  government  has  already  rolled  out  its  plans. 
 

While a considerable share of future electricity demand will be met through both domestic and 
imported  coal,  the  share  of  nuclear-based  electricity  is  set  to  grow  from  a  mere  750  MW  (3 
percent  of  the  present  25000  MW  installed  capacity)  to  9630  MW  (8  percent  of  an  immensely 
larger  energy  pie).  Given  that  nuclear  power  produces  zero  emissions,  the  planned  addition  of 
nuclear power into the overall energy mix is calculated to avoid an annual 21.7 to 56.8 million 
tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030.    

According to the estimates published by World Energy Outlook 2013, some 55 million people in 
Pakistan  do  not  have  access  to  modern  sources  of  energy,  which  is  28  percent  of  the  total 
population of the country. Conversely, peak demand supply gap in the electricity sector currently 
amounts to over 5600 MW.

For  Pakistan  it  would  be  a  challenge  to  achieve  its  targeted  economic  growth  rate  without 
overcoming the prevailing energy crisis  through  an  aggressive increase in  energy supply  in  the 
coming  years. The government energy policy (2013) states that all domestic sources of energy, 
including coal, hydro, natural gas, wind and solar will be fully harnessed in bridging the power 
sector supply shortfall.   

The government plans to achieve an optimal mix of coal, gas and hydro potentials. The planned 
addition  to  the  total  installed  capacity  and  prescribed  energy  mix  will  recognizably  have  an 
impact on the projected emissions of the energy sector.       

 
2.  Response to Climate Change Issues 

2.1. 

Policy Initiatives 

 
Pakistan's  response  to  the  challenges  of  global  warming  and  climate  change  has  been  closely 
aligned  with  its  strategies  for  sustainable  development,  environmental  protection,  sustainable 
development  goals  (SDGs)  and  objectives  of  the  Convention  on  Climate  Change.  Adoption  of 
the  National  Climate  Change  Policy  and  National  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  Policy  in  2012 
provided  a  comprehensive  framework  for  policy  goals  and  actions  towards  mainstreaming 
climate  change,  especially  in  economically  and  socially  vulnerable  sectors  of  the  economy.  A 
follow-up to these policies was the launch in 2013 of the Framework for Implementation of the 
Climate  Change  Policy  (2014-2030),  which  outlines  the  vulnerabilities  of  various  sectors  to 
climate  change  and  identifies  appropriate  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions.  The  Framework 
document was developed to serve as a catalyst for mainstreaming climate change concerns into 
decision-making at national and sub-national levels and to create an enabling environment for an 
integrated climate-compatible development  process.  The document promotes preparation of  the 
National  Adaptation  Plan  (NAP),  Nationally  Appropriate  Mitigation  Actions  (NAMAs),  future 
National  Communications  to  the  UNFCCC  as  well  as  detailed  sub-national  adaptation  action 
plans. 

In  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  these  policy  initiatives,  the  country  has  considerably 
improved  and  strengthened  its  climate  governance  structure  over  time.  Climate  change  and 
environmental  protection  have  been  extensively  recognized  in  national  long-term  plans,  annual 
Economic  Surveys  of  Pakistan,  annual  budgets  and  associated  Public  Sector  Development 
Programmes (PSDP). Specific budgetary allocations have been made at national and sub-national 
levels for execution of the Framework for Implementation of the Climate Change Policy.  

Specific activities and responsibilities relating to climate change concerns are coordinated by the 
Ministry  of  Climate  Change  at  the  national  level  with  corresponding  support  from  the  sub-
national  governments.  The  Ministry  of  Climate  Change  also  works  in  tandem  with  the  other 
concerned federal authorities, research institutions, universities and private sector organizations. 

The Ministry of Climate Change is responsible  for supervising and controlling several attached 
departments  and  implementation  agencies,  namely:  Global  Change  Impact  Studies  Centre 
(GCISC),  National  Disaster  Management  Authority  (NDMA),  Pakistan  Environmental 
Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and Zoological Survey Department of Pakistan (ZSD). It also has 
specialized wings to deal with matters relating to Environment and Forestry. 

At  the  operational  level,  frequent  interaction  is  maintained  with  the  Pakistan  Metrological 
Department  (PMD),  Pakistan  Agricultural  Research  Council  (PARC),  Federal  Flood 
Commission  (FFC),  Indus  River  System  Authority  (IRSA),  Water  and  Power  Development 
Authority  (WAPDA),  National  Energy  Conservation  Centre  (ENERCON),  Alternate  Energy 
Development Board (AEDB) and many private sector organizations. 

The  National  Climate  Change  Policy  and  its  Framework  for  Implementation  make  key 
recommendations  relating  to  mitigation  measures  in  different  sectors  including  energy, 
11 

 

agriculture  and  forestry.  Both  documents  also  provide  the  policy  framework  on  adaptation 
measures  with  particular  focus  on  water,  agriculture  and  livestock,  coastal  areas,  Indus  deltaic 
region, forests and other vulnerable ecosystems.  

Technical Needs Assessment (TNA) for climate change mitigation is being undertaken with the 
assistance of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Preliminary results of the TNA 
exercise  identify  a  host  of  mitigation  technologies  in  energy,  agriculture  and  transport  sectors 
with  a  vast  potential  for  mitigation  ready  to  be  harnessed  but  which  remain  unrealized  due  to 
financial  and  technical  challenges.  Only  a  fraction  of  the  small  hydel  potential  of  about  3,000 
MW  for  power  generation  in  the  shape  of  micro  and  small-scale  hydro  plants  has  so  far  been 
realized.  Similarly,  solar  photovoltaic  and  thermal  technologies  for  power  generation,  water 
pumping, solar geysers and other renewable energy-uses can curtail GHG emissions. A sizeable 
potential also exists in making the buildings energy-efficient and achieving fuel efficiency in the 
transport sector. 

Moreover, the agriculture sector offers promising potential for rationalizing the use of fertilizers 
and improving soil carbon management, promoting use of biogas as a fuel and sustainable forest 
management for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The wetlands in 
Pakistan have also been recognized as promising areas for carbon sequestration.  

Other  key  areas  relate  to  (a)  establishment  of  organizational  structure  at  the  national  and  sub-
national levels; (b) use of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and other market mechanisms 
to  support  climate  change  activities;  (c)  capacity  building;  and  (d)  financing  of  climate  change 
regime  using  national  and  international  resources.  The  Ministry  is  actively  reviewing  policy 
considerations for further integration of market mechanisms in responding to emerging threats in 
the context of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.   

One of the key  recent developments is formulation of the Pakistan Climate Change Act, which 
has been approved by the Cabinet and will be introduced in Parliament for enactment in its next 
session. The proposed Act envisages an over-arching Pakistan Climate Change Council headed 
by  the  Prime  Minister  of  Pakistan,  with  representation  of  the  sub-national  governments  at  the 
Chief  Ministerial  level.  It  also  envisages  establishment  of  a  high-powered  Pakistan  Climate 
Change Authority and Pakistan Climate Change Fund. The Fund would mobilize resources from 
both  domestic  and  international  sources  for  providing  finances  to  support  mitigation  and 
adaptation initiatives in the country.  

Pakistan's Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR), undertaken by United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 2015  shows that the total estimated federal climate-
related  expenditure  remained  between  5.8  and  7.6  percent  of  total  federal  expenditures.  The 
relative  proportion  of  the  climate-relevant  budget  spent  on  adaptation  and  mitigation  varied 
significantly;  adaptation  varied  between  25  and  60  percent  and  mitigation  between  30  and  71 
percent (combined adaptation and mitigation benefits were a maximum of 11 percent). While the 
fiscal  space  for  climate-related  development  expenditures  is  tight,  it  is  nonetheless  growing. 

 

12 

Distribution of budgetary expenses to different climate change related activities is shown in the 
pie chart below: 

 

 
An  augmented  allocation  for  climate-related  activities  has  been  made  in  the  federal  budgets  of 
2015-16  and  2016-17.  Key  initiatives  include  interest-free  loans  to  farmers  for  installation  of 
solar tube wells;  abolishing tax duty for import of solar equipment, promoting other renewable 
technologies in meeting the energy needs of the country and ambitious plans of afforestation. 

Before  promulgation  of  the  Eighteenth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  (18th  Amendment)  in 
2010, the Ministry of Environment dealt with all climate change-related concerns in the country 
at  the  national  level.  Sub-national  governments  were  mainly  functioning  as  implementers  of 
national  policies,  primarily  by  way  of  devising  projects  and  programs  within  their  respective 
development plans and jurisdictions. With the 18th Amendment coming into effect, large sets of 
responsibilities  were  devolved  to  sub-national  governments,  which  have  taken  charge  of  the 
climate  change  concerns  and  have  started  embarking  upon  several  institutional  and  policy 
development initiatives in this regard.  

Considering the over-arching nature of climate  change and also  to  cater  to national  obligations 
vis-à-vis  international  treaties  and  agreements,  a  full-fledged  Ministry  of  Climate  Change  was 
established at the national level in 2012.  

A synopsis of climate change actions being undertaken by  the sub-national governments are as 
follows: 

o  Establishment  of  Directorates  of  Climate  Change  and  Multilateral  Environment 

Agreement (MEAs) 

 

13 

o  Formulation of climate change policies 
o  Frameworks for implementing climate change policies 
o  Constitution of climate change policy implementation committees 
o  Construction of 1,000 MW Quaid-e-Azam solar park in Punjab 
o  Improvement  of  urban  public  transport  systems,  especially  Bus  Rapid  Transport  at 
Lahore,  Rawalpindi-Islamabad  and  Multan,  and  urban  rail  transport  (Orange  Line)  at 
Lahore 

o  Green Pakistan Programme of tree plantation across Pakistan 
o  Large-scale tree plantation programmes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  
o  Conservation of national parks and protected areas 
o  Natural resource management 
o  Clean development mechanism 
o  Green Charter for cities (already signed for Islamabad) 

 

With  the  institutional  infrastructure  rapidly  becoming  operational  at  the  sub-national  level,  the 
national  climate  policy  action  plans  are  being  re-defined  with  sub-national  governments  taking 
on  dominant  roles  and  responsibilities.  It  is  expected  that  with  the  consolidation  of  legal  and 
institutional infrastructure, the overall climate governance structure will strengthen and allow the 
Ministry  of  Climate  Change  to  better  assist  policy  and  operational  activities  of  sub-national 
entities.  

2.2. 

Adaptation  

Pakistan is among the most severely threatened countries in terms of climate-induced challenges. 
Individual areas face unique stresses, which can be quite different depending on the geographical 
location  and  rate  of  urbanization  of  the  individual  administrative  units  within  Pakistan.  This 
requires  a  multifaceted  approach  to  climate  change  at  the  national  level,  as  well  as  active 
engagement with sub-national representatives. 

For  Pakistan,  adaptation  to  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  is  inevitable  and  likely  to 
become critical in future. Due to geo-physical conditions, climatic extremes and high degrees of 
exposure and vulnerability, Pakistan has become a disaster-prone country. Frequent exposure to 
extreme  climate-induced  events  such  as  droughts,  floods,  landslides,  cyclonic  activities, 
recession of glaciers, glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF) and heat-waves have led the country 
to rank amongst top ten most climate-affected countries on the Global Climate Risk Index.  

Agriculture is a critical component of Pakistan's economy and the main livelihood source of the 
people.  Much of the country is arid and semi-arid; hence 90 percent of agricultural production 
comes from irrigated lands. Low growth in the sector coupled with rapid population expansion is 
contributing  to  increasing  levels  of  food  insecurity.  Besides,  Pakistan  is  also  a  water  stressed 
country with inadequate water storage facilities and an aging water infrastructure, including the 
country's vast irrigation network.  

The National Economic & Environmental Development Study (NEEDS) shows that the average 
cost of adaptation to flood disasters ranges between US$ 2.0 - 3.8 billion per annum, depending 
on  the  frequency  and  intensity.    However,  it  does  not  include  adaptation  cost  of  other  climate 
14 

 

change-induced  extreme  events  such  as  glacial  lake  outbursts,  cyclones,  heat  waves  and 
droughts. Overall, Pakistan's adaptation needs range between US$ 7 - 14 billion per annum. 

Government of Pakistan is in the process of developing a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) at the 
national  level  for  creating  a  framework  of  action  to  guide  the  implementing  agencies  on 
mainstreaming  of  medium  and  long-term  climate  change  efforts  into  policies,  strategies  and 
programmes.  This  is  to  provide  capacity  support  for  a  more  coordinated  approach  within  and 
among different levels and tiers of the government.  

Along with NAP, sectoral and sub-national adaptation plans would also be prepared, that would 
incorporate  the  recommendations  and  actions  considered  so  far.  These  plans  would  enable  the 
sub-national  governments  in  prioritizing  their  adaptation  needs  and  allocating  corresponding 
financial resources.  

An overview of the adaptation road map is presented below: 

Table 2: National Adaptation Priorities 

Long-term Vision 

To  build  a  climate  resilient  society  and  economy  by  ensuring  that 
climate  change  is  mainstreamed  in  the  economically  and  socially 
vulnerable sectors of the economy. 

Medium to long-
term actions (up to 
2030) 

 

 

 

To support achievement of our long-term adaptation vision of a climate- 
resilient society, Pakistan will pursue efforts up to 2030 that address the  
vulnerability  of  water,  agriculture  and  infrastructure  to  climate  change 
by taking the  following actions: 

* 

Improving  the  irrigation  system  through  actions  such  as  lining  of 
canals and irrigation channels 

*  Enhancing water resource management through: 

 

Integrated watershed management 

  Water conservation 

  Development  and  optimization  of  water  resource  allocation, 
implementation  of  strict  water  management  regulations  and 
utilization  of  unconventional  water  resources  such  as  
recycling of used water and harvesting rain  water and flood 
water 

*  Strengthening risk management system for the agriculture sector 

* 

Implementing a comprehensive Climate Smart Agriculture program 

*  Building climate-resilient infrastructure with focus on improved and 
safe operation of water-related infrastructure and better management 
of  transport  operations  and  energy  transmission,  supported  by 
innovations  in  urban  planning  for  synergistic  implementation  of 
mitigation and adaptation actions  

15 

Near-term actions 

 (2020-2025) 

 

Support 

Improving  the  emergency  response  mechanism  for  managing 
extreme  climate  events  and  strengthening  the  development  of 
disaster  reduction  and  relief  management  systems  based  on  risk 
assessments,  aligned  with  the  goals  of  Sendai  Framework  on 
Disaster Risk Reduction: 2015-2030 

*  Led  by  the  Ministry  of  Climate  Change,  Pakistan  shall  develop  a 
National  Adaptation  Plan  (NAP)  that  will  create  a  framework  for 
guiding  the  mainstreaming  of  medium-  and  long-term  climate 
change  concerns  into  national  sectoral  policies,  strategies  and 
programmes.  The  framework  will  help  provide    a  basis  for  a  more 
coordinated  approach  within  and  among  different 
levels  of 
government for climate-resilient development 

*  Sub-national  adaptation  planning  capacity  will  be  strengthened, 
leading  to  the  formation  of  adaptation  strategies  and  plans  aligned 
with  NAP  that  will  facilitate  local  level  adaptation  and  mainstream 
adaptation into sector -level policies at the sub-national level 

*  Disaster risk management capacity will be further enhanced through 
implementation  of  actions  under  ‘National  Disaster  Management 
Plan' that includes strengthening of institutional and legal system for 
disaster  management,  preparation  of  disaster  management  plans, 
awareness  raising  and  establishment  of  a  national  emergency 
response mechanism 

through 

•  Development of a multitude  of professionals in the field of climate 
change 
for 
individuals  in  the  disciplines  of  geo-sciences,  social  sciences, 
management 
and 
implementation 

strengthened  educational  opportunities 

sciences,  governance,  policy 

formation 

•  Providing financial support based on detailed cost assessments and 
balancing  domestic  contributions  with  needed  support  from  the 
international community 

2.3.  Mitigation  

There is widespread potential for mitigation in all sectors of the national economy.  Based on a 
review  of  existing  literature  and  available  secondary  data,  an  estimation  of  overall  mitigation 
potential has been reached. This  exercise has  also highlighted the challenges, predominantly in 
the  shape  of  technological  and  financial  constraints,  which  are  restricting  Pakistan  from  fully 
harnessing its mitigation potential.  

 

16 

Pakistan  is  on  the  verge  of  embarking  on  an  unprecedented  phase  of  economic  growth  and 
development with large-scale investments in high emissions sectors, providing an opportunity for 
realizing  the  obvious  mitigation  potential.  However,  technical  and  financial  constraints  would 
need  to  be  addressed  through  international  climate  financing  and  technology  transfer 
mechanisms. 

2.3.1. 

Options in Energy Sector 

 
An  overview  of  mitigation  potential  and  mitigation  options  in  two  key  emission-generating 
sectors of the economy are presented below: 

Table 3: Mitigation Options in Energy Supply Sector 

Options 
 
High Priority 
 
Increase in grid 
efficiency 

Justification for Ranking / Priority 

*  Transmission  and  distribution  losses  are  known  to  be 
significant in the country, reaching 18% of total generation in 
2015.    Therefore  improvements  in  the  level  of  efficiency  of 
the grid would lead not only to cost savings but also represent 
a significant GHG mitigation potential 

Improvement in coal 
efficiency 

* 

Improving  the  efficiency  of  planned  coal-based  power 
generation  could  lead  to  GHG  mitigation.    This  measure  is 
particularly  important  in  view  of    plans  for  developing 
Pakistan's  coal  resources  and  significantly  increasing  the 
fuel's importance in domestic electricity generation 

Large scale and 
distributed grid 
connected solar, 
wind and 
hydroelectricity 

Low Priority 
 
Carbon 
sequestration  

 

 

 

*  These  three  options  represent  the  three  distinct  renewable 
energy  options  believed  to  be  viable  for  Pakistan.    Their 
potential as low-carbon sources of energy and their perceived 
cost-effectiveness warranted their inclusion in the analysis 

*  Though there is no plan at present for carbon sequestration in 
the  country  due  to  uncertainty  surrounding  implementation 
potential  and  associated  high  costs,  yet  it  would  become 
relevant given the availability of resources

3.  GHG Emissions: Inventory and Analysis 

3.1. 

Greenhouse Gas Inventory 

Commitments  in  Pak-INDC  in  response  to  the  Paris  Agreement  are  based  on  socio-economic 
realities  and  their  impact  on  the  country's  current  and  future  GHG  emissions.  The  emissions 
have  been  quantified  on  the  basis  of  the  latest  available  data  and  recently  completed  national 
GHG inventory for 2014-15. 

Setting  2015  as  the  base  year  for  quantification  of  emissions  has  allowed  consideration  of  the 
latest  economic and industry parameters as well as  the government's  targeted growth  rates  and 
development  goals  and  objectives.  Implications  on  emissions  of  aggressive  national  plans  for 
addressing  the  prevailing  energy  crisis  and  adequately  meeting  projected  energy  needs  up  to 
2030  have also been given due consideration. 

It  needs  to  be  highlighted  that  the  present  GHG  inventory  has  been  prepared  using  UNFCCC 
revised 1996 guidelines, applying the Tier 1 approach (which includes default emission factors).  
Due  to  non-availability  of  detailed  data  in  some  sectors  and  absence  of  tier  2  and  tier  3 
approaches, the present estimates may not be considered as precise and highly accurate. Hence, 
there  is  a  possibility  that  emissions  from  certain  sub-sectors  and  sub-sub-sectors  may  not  have 
been fully taken into account. Nonetheless, utilization of country/region specific emission factors 
would have certainly led to higher levels of emissions as compared to the presented estimates. 

20 

 

3.2. 

Emissions by Sectors 

 
Based on the National GHG Inventory for 2014-15, the total GHG emissions of Pakistan add up 
to  405  MT  CO2-equivalent.  The  inventory  quantifies  the  emissions  for  five  key  GHG 
contributing sectors of the economy, which are energy, agriculture, industrial processes, land use 
and forestry, and waste.

21 

3.2.1. 

Energy 

 

The  historical  trend  of  energy-related  emissions  over  the  last  20  years  corresponds  with 
economic  growth  and  developmental  pathways  of  successive  governments,  having  focus  on 
addressing the issue of energy security. The country, however, continues to suffer from a severe 
energy  crisis  that  needs  to  be  addressed  on  priority  basis  in  the  coming  years.  The  national 
government is committed to exploring all sources of energy to resolve the prevailing crisis. The 
sector  also  offers  the  most  promising  mitigation  potential,  which  can  be  realized  by  making 
available required funding and technologies. 

3.2.2. 

Agriculture 

Agriculture  remains  the  second  highest  contributor  to  the  economy,  a  situation  that  is  likely  to 
continue in the coming years. The increase in emissions from the agriculture sector over the last 
20  years  also  corresponds  with  economic  growth  and  developmental  pathways  of  successive 
governments.  Focusing  on  ensuring  food  security  for  a  continuously  increasing  population 
underscores the relevance of the food security challenge. It merits recognition that the sector will 
make  major  GHG  contributions  in  the  coming  years.  However  the  sector  also  offers  very 
promising mitigation potential. 

 

 

3.2.3. 

Industrial Processes 

Industrial processes show a gradual increase in  emissions over the last twenty  years. Again the 
trend is consistent with the overall emissions trajectory. Slightly lower increase in the industrial 
emissions  is  also  an  indicator  of  relatively  slow  growth  in  industrial  sector.  It  needs  to  be 
recognized however that slower historical emissions of the industrial sector are not indicative of 
future  industrial  sector  emissions,  particularly  in  the  context  of  governmental  plans  for  GDP 
growth and industrial growth.    

3.2.4. 

Land Use Change and Forestry 

 

Contributions  of  ‘Land  Use  Change  and  Forestry'  sector  in  overall  emissions  profile  of  the 
country  are  merely  2%.  A  consistent  but  gradual  increase  can  be  noticed  over  the  last  twenty 
years.  Another  striking  fact  in  this  sector  is  the  alarming  rate  of  deforestation  (27,000  hectares 
per year). With strengthened regulations and aggressive plans for reforestation, it is expected that 
the  country  will  benefit  from  the  sink  effect  in  the  long  run.  However,  in  the  short-term  the 
emissions are expected to increase. 

 

 

22 

3.2.5.  Waste 

 
Although waste is a low emissions contributing sector in the overall emissions trajectory but with 
the  unprecedented  increase  in  the  urbanization  rate  and  forecasted  GDP  growth,  the  emissions 
are expected to grow exponentially in future. Pakistan being one of the fastest urbanizing country 
of the region, foresees a logical increase in GHG contributions of the waste sector.  

Analysis of Current Emissions 

3.3. 
 

A comparison of increase in emissions over the last twenty-one years (1994 - 2015), coinciding 
with GHG inventory preparation activities in the country, shows an increasing trend in emissions 
in  all sectors of economy. Overall increase in  emissions  over the period of twenty-one  years is 
approximately  123  percent.  The  average  annual  increase  works  out  to  10  MT  CO2  equivalent, 
which  represents  annual  growth  rate  of  3.9  percent,  with  periods  of  high  and  low-growth 
emissions  commensurate  with  economic  performance.  The  historical  trend  of  increase  in 
emissions  has  so  far  been  fairly  consistent;  however  the  envisaged  economic  growth  and 
increasingly conducive macro-economic environment are likely to boost future emissions.    

Understandably the most predominant increase has taken place in energy and agriculture sectors. 
Energy  sector  emissions  in  the  year  2015  increased  by  117  percent  whereas  upsurge  in  the 
agriculture  sector  is  as  high  as  145  percent.  Average  percentage  increase  in  emissions  of  other 
sectors, however, remained less than 85 percent. 

As evident from the figures quoted above, sectoral share of emissions has not  seen any change 
over  the  years.  Agriculture  and  energy  sectors  remained  prominent,  in  accordance  with  the 
overall  developmental  trend  of  the  economy.  Agriculture  being  the  backbone  of  economy 
contributes  significantly  to  the  overall  emissions  profile  of  the  country.  Within  the  agriculture 
sector,  livestock  has  the  major  share  in  emissions.  Increase  and  dominance  of  energy  sector  is 
also an indicator of increasing demand for the energy both as a result of growing population and 
also increase in energy demand in other associated sectors, particularly agriculture and transport.  

Decrease  in  the  share  of  emissions  from  industrial  processes  sector  is  explicably  due  to 
prevailing  energy  crisis  in  the  country,  which  severely  curtailed  the  production  capacity  of  the 
sector  during  all  these  years.  Textile  sector,  being  the  largest  contributing  sector  in  the  overall 
industrial  production,  has  particularly  suffered  to  the  extent  that  a  significant  portion  of  the 
industry  relocated  to  other  countries  of  the  region;  consequently  slowing  down  the  growth  of 
industry. With the priority of the present government to eradicate energy crisis by 2018 and also 
to  harness  economic  dividend  from  the  potential  CPEC  opportunities,  the  share  of  emissions 
from the industrial sector is expected to grow exponentially. Based on the increase in industrial 
growth, the sector foresees a growth of up to 14 percent in the industrial output.  Similarly, with 
the rapid increase in urbanization, the share of the waste sector is also expected to increase in the 
coming years.

4.  Future Projections and Abatement Cost 

4.1. 

Approach and Methodology 

 

 
Quantification  of  future  emissions  in  Pakistan  has  been  based  on  possible  future  scenarios  and 
assumptions,  apart  from  a  number  of  other  relevant  factors.  The  country  is  passing  through  a 
unique phase of economic and social development, and is faced with grave challenges, including 
of a rapidly increasing population and threats to its food security and energy security. Therefore, 
a detailed analysis of future emissions is based on a wide range of probable scenarios in different 
sectors.  Since  GDP  growth  is  considered  to  have  a  strong  correlation  with  GHG  emission 
pathways,  particularly  during  the  early  developmental  phase,  it  is  imperative  to  establish  a 
realistically  credible  GDP  growth  scenario  for  projecting  the  levels  of  GHG  emission  for  this 
period.  

The  methodology  for  quantification  of  future  emissions  has  been  customized  to  integrate  the 
multiple  emerging  factors,  which  historically  has  not  been  the  practice  in  Pakistan.  The 
quantification  of  future  emissions  based  on  the  ‘business  as  usual'  scenario  is,  however,  not 
consistent  with  future  economic  growth  and  developmental  objectives  of  Pakistan.  Hence,  the 
methodology  has  been  suitably  adjusted  to  cater  for  the  emerging  needs  and  the  forthcoming 
parameters in the developmental planning of Pakistan.     

The Vision 2025 document of the Government of Pakistan sets a target of average GDP growth 
rate  of  7  percent  until  the  year  2025,  which  has  been  used  for  the  extended  period  until  2030. 
Further  incremental  growth  rate  due  to  CPEC  investments,  infrastructure  development  and 
increasing energy demand has been adequately incorporated. Based on this adjusted GDP growth 
rate,  the  sectoral  growth  rates  have  been  calculated,  thereby  providing  the  sector-specific  basis 
for  quantification  of  the  projected  sectoral  emissions  till  the  year  2030.  Although  historical 
sectoral  growth  rates  have  been  duly  considered,  the  parameters  for  future  scenarios  are 
considered to be more relevant. 

In an endeavor to fully incorporate possible future prospects and also to undertake the analytical 
exercise, possible scenarios of emissions growth have been prepared with due care. This helped 
analyze  the  overall  emissions  trajectory  on  a  broad  spectrum  with  comprehensive  perspective, 
leading  to  the  final  emissions  numbers.  Hence,  projected  emissions  for  different  sectors  are 
believed to be the most representative and quantitatively realistic.    

4.2. 

Sector-wise Projection of Emissions 

4.2.1. 

Energy Sector  

 
Energy  is  currently  the  largest  contributing  sector  in  Pakistan's  emissions  profile,  contributing 
nearly 46 percent to total emissions; and its share is likely to grow significantly in future.  

Calculation of projected emissions for the year 2030 is based on the accelerated growth scenario 
of the energy sector, adjusted to the average GDP growth rate as estimated by the government. It 

24 

 

envisages  a  high  demand  power  sector  growth  scenario,  which  would  result  in  substantial 
increase  in  total  electricity  capacity  of  the  grid  by  the  year  2030,  from  domestic  as  well  as 
imported  coal  power  plants  and  additional  hydel  generation.  Share  of  LNG  and  renewable 
sources such as wind and hydro, is also likely to significantly increase in future. 

Keeping  in  view  the  projected  rate  of  GDP  growth  and  sectoral  growth;  and  taking  into 
consideration  the  proposed  implementation  of  power  generation  investment  plans,  projected 
emissions for the year 2030 for energy sector are calculated as 898 MT CO2-equivalent.  
 

 

4.2.2. 

Agriculture 

 
Agriculture is the second largest  sector contributing 43% of GHG emissions as recorded in the 
current  GHG  emissions  inventory.  Although  the  percentage  share  of  agriculture  in  the  coming 
years  is  likely  to  decrease  due  to  expected  growth  in  the  industrial  and  transport  sectors,  the 
sector will continue to remain an important emissions contributor due to inherent inter-linkage of 
agriculture growth with food security and poverty alleviation. While achieving the diversification 
of  the  economy,  sustained  growth  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  one  of  the  priority  areas  of  the 
national  government.  The  forecasted  economic  growth  rate,  duly  adjusted,  shows  a  faster 
agriculture  sector  growth  as  compared  to  its  average  historical  trend  of  about  03  percent  per 
annum. Minimum agriculture growth rate of 04 percent has been determined by the government 
to improve food security and ensure minimum nutritional value for the growing population.  

Improvement in  per capita incomes  is already being  reflected in a shift  in the dietary habits of 
increasing proportions of population and the trend is likely to be intensified in foreseeable future. 
With  expected  healthy  rise  in  GDP  and  sizeable  impact  of  CPEC  interventions,  this  growth  is 
likely  to  be  well  over  4%  per  annum.  The  required  adjustment  of  agricultural  growth  rate  has 
been taken into consideration while calculating emissions from the agriculture sector. 

The projected size of total agriculture emissions adds up to 457 MT CO2-equivalent.  

4.2.3. 

Industrial Processes 

 

 
Share  of  emissions  from  industrial  processes  currently  stands  at  slightly  over  5%,  with 
expectations  of  exponential  growth  in  the  coming  years.  This  growth  in  industrial  activity  is 
considered to be the engine for higher targeted GDP growth beyond the current industrial sector 
growth of 7% per annum. It is envisaged that CPEC will boost the projected annual average trade 
volume  by  24  percent  in  2016-2020  and  by  another  16  percent  in  the  2020-30  decade.  As  the 
industrial sector is likely to see substantial growth, its share of emissions will also increase in the 
near future.  

Projected emissions for the industrial sector for year 2030 are 130 MT CO2-equivalent.  

 

 

25 

4.2.4. 

Land Use Change and Forestry 

Historical  emissions  from  the  land  use  change  and  forestry  sector  remained  2  to  3  percent  of 
overall emissions. The projected increase in emissions is based on massive changes in land use 
and enormous deforestation which the country is currently suffering and potential use of biomass 
in  energy  and  industrial  processes.  Large-scale  tree  plantation  programmes  in  Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa and Green Pakistan Programme are likely to increase forest cover from the current 
5 percent to 6 percent, using domestic resources during the period 2016-2020. An approximate 
amount of US$ 936 million has been allocated for this purpose. An increase in the forest cover 
from 6 to 10 percent by the year 2030 requires an estimated US$ 3.74 billion. 

Projected emissions for the land use change and forestry sector for  year 2030  are 29 MT CO2-
equivalent. 

4.2.5 

Waste 

Waste  has  so  far  seen  a  gradual  increase  in  the  share  of  overall  emissions  in  Pakistan.  It  is 
expected  to  grow  significantly  in  the  foreseeable  future.  The  share  of  the  waste  sector  in  the 
current GHG inventory is 3 percent, which is quite low as compared to the size of the population. 
However, Pakistan is in the midst of rapid urbanization, which would result in a sharp increase in 
the  overall  amount  of  waste  generation  and  consequently  an  increased  share  of  waste  sector 
emissions. The increased GDP growth rate coupled with an urbanization growth rate of 3 percent 
are major considerations in calculation of waste sector emissions. 

Projected emissions for the waste sector for year 2030 are 89 MT CO2-equivalent. 

4.3 

Overall Projected Emissions for 2030 

Projected levels of GHG emissions and their comparison with the last two GHG inventory years 
(1994 and 2015) are as follows:

4.4 

Estimation of Abatement Cost 
 

The calculation of abatement cost has been made by applying the production function approach, 
which  is  a  model  to  explain  output  (GDP)  consisting  of  function  of  independent  variables  and 
application  of  realistic  economic  assumptions.  This  calculation  of  the  cost  of  reducing  GHG 
emissions (abatement cost) in terms of lost output (opportunity/abatement cost of reducing GHG 
emissions) is a function of policy regulations and/or a consequence of adverse impacts of climate 
change.  In  other  words  it  is  regulation  driven  [marginal]  loss  in  productivity,  which  results  in 
GHG reductions. Since the estimation of cost is directly dependent on a number of variables and 
technological options, it is important that abatement cost is calculated for a range of possibilities 
and  scenarios  to  fully  encompass  different  assumptions  for  emission  reductions  and  different 
policy options.  

Based on economic analyses, a reduction of up to 20 percent in the projected emissions for 2030 
would require approximately US$ 40 billion calculated at current prices.  
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution  

 

5.1 
 

National Parameters 

The  future  emissions  trajectory  of  Pakistan  depends  upon  a  number  of  factors,  both  favorable 
and unfavorable. First, the huge gap in energy supply and demand presently faced by the country 
has  to  be  met  on  a  fast  track  basis  if  the  economy  is  to  follow  the  envisaged  rate  of  growth. 
Secondly,  with  the  country  still  at  an  early  stage  of  development,  any  move  to  reduce  GHG 
emissions without required financial assistance and technological support would compromise the 
nation's ability to meet growing needs of the huge population, with high poverty levels. Thirdly, 
there are critical deficiencies in social and economic infrastructure requiring immediate attention 
of the government. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the GHG emissions of Pakistan in 2030 
would be 1603 MT CO2-equivalent.  

Given  the  future  economic  growth  and  associated  growth  in  the  energy  sector,  the  peaking  of 
emissions  in  Pakistan  is  expected  to  take  place  much  beyond  the  year  2030.  An  exponential 
increase of GHG emissions for many decades is likely to occur before any decrease in emissions 
can be expected.  

In view of the importance of the objectives of UNFCCC at both the national and global levels, 
Pakistan  is  determined  to  reduce  its  emissions  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  However, 
financial and technical constraints do not permit realization of the full mitigation potential. It is 
likely that these challenges will continue to feature prominently in future national discourse and 
would  only  be  effectively  addressed  with  financial  grants  and  technical  assistance  from  the 
international community.  

 

27 

5.2 

Pak-INDC Statement  

 

Having considered the existing potential for mitigation in the country, Pakistan intends to reduce 
up to 20% of its 2030 projected GHG emissions subject to availability of international grants to 
meet the total abatement cost for the indicated 20 percent reduction amounting to about US$ 40 
billion at current prices. 

Pakistan's adaptation needs range between U$ 7 to U$ 14 billion/annum during this period. 

 

5.3 

Implementation Mechanism 
 

Through its National Climate Change Policy, Pakistan has recognized the necessity for a suitable 
process to monitor and evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of potential actions. This also applies to the 
effectiveness of interventions in reducing vulnerabilities to climate change and overall progress 
towards  achievement  of  adaptation  objectives.  The  mechanism  to  ensure  appropriateness  of 
adaptation measures is in place. However, it needs to be implemented effectively and adjusted on 
a regular basis in response to new information and knowledge.  

The Ministry of Climate Change acts as the focal agency in Pakistan for preparation,  updating, 
coordination  and  implementation  supervision  of  the  Pak-INDC.  A  high-powered  body 
comprising  key  stakeholders  from  national  government,  sub-national  governments  and  private 
sector would steer the process.  

The  above  institutional  arrangements  would  continue,  leading  up  to  the  review  and  revision  of 
Pak-INDC  and  its  implementation  during  the  period  2016-2030.  This  institutional  arrangement 
will also help improve national development planning processes. 

 

 

5.4  Assessment of Capacity Building Needs 

Potential for mitigation and need for adaptation is well recognized and elaborately documented 
in Pakistan; and so is the determination of capacity gaps. Need for capacity building exists both 
at policy as well as operational levels at national and sub-national tiers alike. As an aftermath of 
the 18th Amendment, sub-national governments are now carrying out both policy and operational 
work. Hence there is a need for harmonizing national and sub-national policies and synergizing 
the action agenda so that considerations of climate change can be incorporated into over-arching 
development  planning  in  a  coherent  manner.  The  Ministry  of  Climate  Change,  which  plays  a 
pivotal role at the national level, would also benefit from institutional strengthening and capacity 
enhancement.  

 

28 

In  acknowledgment  of  the  potential  for  mitigation  and  identification  of  priority  areas  for 
adaption, an independent assessment of capacity building needs has been carried out, considering 
following specific aspects: 

* 

In  spite  of  climate  change  being  increasingly  recognized  as  a  critical  issue  interlinked 
with  all key sectors of the economy, the  requisite institutional  and policy linkages  have 
not been fully established; 
 

*  Technical  capacity for climate proofing of existing and future developmental projects is 
low. This has kept climate change largely disconnected from development programs and 
projects,  restraining  the  country  from  climate  compatible  and  disaster  resilient 
developmental pathways;  
 

*  Mitigation typically requires technological upgrades with sophisticated technical capacity 
and  additional  costs.  Long-term  planning  and  institutional  strengthening,  however, 
remain  pre-requisites  for  adaptation  at  the  local  level.  For  fully  realizing  the  prevailing 
potential  for  both  mitigation  and  adaptation,  technical  capacity  at  all  levels  needs  to  be 
enhanced; and 
 

*  With the bulk  of climate change policy implementation  actions  now to  be implemented 
by  the  sub-national  governments,  the  capacity  building  programmes  relating  to  policy 
formulations,  climate  proofing  of  developmental  projects,  natural  capital  management 
and institutional strengthening shall have to be increasingly implemented at sub-national 
level.

Conclusion 

Pakistan  reiterates  its  commitment  and  obligations  towards  the  United  Nations  Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement, and the objective to limit the average global 
temperature increase to 1.5 to 2.0 degrees Centigrade. It will continue to play a meaningful role in 
global efforts towards achieving this goal. As explained in the Pak-INDC, a number of mitigation 
and adaptation measures and actions are already being undertaken with domestic resources. These 
measures  and  actions  can  be  intensified  in  coming  years  with  expected  availability  of 
international climate finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.
