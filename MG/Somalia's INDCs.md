1. Introduction  
Somalia has prepared its INDCs in line with UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) and the decision of the "Lima Call for Action" to formulate its policy, plans and 
mitigation  and adaptation projects intended to achieve the objectives of the INDCs. Such 
policies and planed projects proposed are based on the status of environment of the 
country, existing and planned policies for sustainable sector based developments  and 
Somalia's  Compact and New Deal, which was adopted in 2013 by the Federal Government 
of  Somalia (Federal Republic of Somalia, 2013).  

1.1. Climate, Ecology and the Status of the Environment 
Somalia is generally arid and semi-arid with two seasonal rainfall. The rainfall is influenced 
by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the north-south movement, which results 
in two rainy seasons and two dry seasons a year. January to March are the longest dry 
"Jilaal" season, resulting from ITCZ coming from the dry Arabian Peninsula. This is followed 
by the "Gu" a major rainy season from April to June. Then the dry "Jilaal" dry season from 
July to September, which is associated with cool sea breezes from the Indian Ocean that 
result in light coastal "Hagaaya" rains in July and August. There is also the "Deyr" light rainy 
season in October and November. Total annual average rainfall is 280 mm and the highest 
annual rainfall is about in about 500-600 mm in high rainfall years (UNEP, 2005) 

Somalia has limited forest of about 10.5 percent of the area of the country, because most of 
the tropical forest along the Shabelle and Jubba Rivers and the inter-riverine areas, have 
been cleared for agricultural use (World Bank, 2012). In addition, after the civil war, the 
production of charcoal for local cooking use and mostly for export to Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirate (UAE) solely for tobacco smoking using "Shisha" had a negative 
deforestation impact. There is also some charcoal export to Yemen and India. Aerial survey 
reveals drastic clearing of forest throughout the southern Somalia (UNDP and World Bank, 
2007). Therefore, the production and export of charcoal resulted in a colossal deforestation 
that resulted in desertification (Hamza, Buri M., 2012). 

The lack of alternative source of energy for domestic cooking and the inefficient process of 
making charcoal was already contributing to deforestation. However, the greatest damage 
resulted from the huge export of charcoal to the Gulf Countries. The Acacia species, were 
originally source of grazing for goats and camels, nitrogen fixation to enhance soil fertility, 
fencing of livestock in night enclosures and the traditional use of only dead trees for 
cooking. Such local use was sustainable, but logging of living trees for charcoal export 
resulted in extreme deforestation and is leading to desertification.  In addition, the acacia 
trees do not grow fast enough to replace the felled trees. Therefore rangeland which 
consisted of forest trees of mostly Acacia species, shrubs and grassland are denuded and  

results in soil erosion. These factors lead to the reduction of land use for agriculture and 
pastoral livestock production (UNDP and World Bank, 2007). 

Most charcoal is today produced in Southern Somalia and illegal exports (about 80 percent 
of production) constitute a large share of all exports from the South. There has been a rapid 
expansion in the production of charcoal in recent years, with much of it being exported to 
meet demand of the above mentioned importing countries. The incentives for charcoal 
exports are clear: charcoal prices in Southern Somali regions are in the vicinity of US$3-4 
per bag, while in the Gulf States the same bags sell for US$10 each (UNDP and World Bank, 
2007). 

 

1.2. Disasters in Somalia and the Needed Policies and Actions 
Somalia is experiencing a number of recurring disasters as it is reported in a number of 
disasters data bases such as Emdat as indicated in Table 1 (Abdiweli Sulaiman Abdi, 2013):

The data presented above is reasonably clear and shows the fact that there is an enormous 
challenge ahead as to what should be done to mitigate and adapt to those recurring 
disasters and why are we trapped in this cycle? It is also worth to remember that Somalia's 
long coastline, the longest coastline of Africa is about 3,333 km long and about 55 per cent 
of its population lives along this coastline. 0n 26 December 2004, Somalia was hit by the 
tsunami that killed more than 300 people and destroyed homes, boats and fishing 
equipment and about 18,000 households were estimated to be directly affected. 

The recent tropical cyclones as recent Chapola and Megh Cyclones (November, 2015) that 
threatened Somalia are amongst the most powerful and destructive meteorological 
systems on earth that Somalia should be aware of. With the current global warming, 
Somalia is at risk and has all the  six main requirements  to suffer from this types of tropical 
cyclones again and again; and those requirements are: sufficiently warm sea surface 
temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the 
troposphere, enough causes to sustain a low pressure center, a preexisting low level focus 
or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear.  

The combination of the disasters Somalia is prone to and the disasters occurrence 
predictions from scientists clearly show that the worst is yet to come. At this era, Somalia 
cannot afford to lose so many lives again. Therefore an effective disaster management, a 
well warned and informed population and a coordinated joint government inter-
ministerial plans are needed to achieve mitigation and adaption measures.  

 

1.3. Importance of Livestock, Crop, Fisheries and Wildlife   
The mainstay of the Somali economy has traditionally been dominated by pastorals and 
crop production, followed by fisheries and forestry and these four sectors are supporting 
over 80% of the population. The Boswella criteria and sacra trees are highly-prized for 
producing frankincense, however, their natural regeneration is threatened by overgrazing. 
Somalia is also a large producer of myrrh and gum Arabic. The Cordeauxia edulis plant 
which produces yeeb nuts in the central regions is now thought to be endangered. The level 
of agricultural production, including bananas, cotton, rice, mango trees, and citrus, is 
generally far below its peaks of the late 1980s. Notably, at least 151 plants in Somalia have 
known medicinal values.  Livestock continues to dominate exports, followed by sesame, dry 
lemon, charcoal, fish, hides and skins.  Prior to the civil war, livestock and livestock 
products accounted for 65% of the country's exports, which was followed by banana with 
an export of 116,000 metric tons in 1989. Although, goats and sheep which constituted a 
population of about 35 million in 1988 have been slightly reduced to 30.5 million, still their 
export is substantial and mostly to Arabian countries. In addition, Somalia is number one in 
camel population in the world. 

There is also evidence of a decline in rangelands biodiversity (grass and herbs, trees and 
bush lands shrubs), affecting certain parts of the country, particularly those close to urban 
areas, and areas such as the Sool Plateau in the northern part of the country. An IUCN 
survey (2006) found Somali's northern ranges to be most seriously degraded (as much as 
50%) owing to steep topography, large numbers of livestock, and proximity to ports for 
livestock export.  In addition, over much of the country, many areas around water 
boreholes and wells are degraded.  

Somalia has the longest coast in Africa, which is about 3,333 kilometers and is endowed 
with diverse and high fisheries and other marine resources. It is estimated to have the 
capacity of 200,000-300,000 tons of sustainable fish production per annum, however, prior 
to the civil war only about 15,000 tons were harvested per annum. At present, marine 
resources have been in great decline due to the current trend of unregulated, uncontrolled 
and illegal fishing. The consequences of these activities are illustrated by the fact that the 
once substantial and valuable lobster export trade is suffering, and artisan fishermen are 
finding it increasingly difficult to sustain an adequate livelihood from lobster harvesting  

because of the decline in stocks.  Illegal inshore fishing by foreign commercial boats has 
also caused destruction to coral reefs.  In addition, the world's main oil transport tankers 
pass through the Gulf of Aden. With no surveillance mechanism in place, this movement of 
tankers results in the constant threat of oil spillage and toxic waste dumping off the Somali 
coastline.  

In terms of wildlife, only small remnant pockets of wildlife now exist, with many species 
approaching extinction. The elephant (Lexodonta Africana), black rhino (Deceros bicornis), 
lion (Panthera Leo), and Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) have been 
wiped out from most of the country, while the wild ass (Equus asinus somalicus) that once 
numbered in the thousands has been reduced to just a few dozen. 

1.4. Environmental Challenges Resulting from Charcoal Production 

and Export  

The most rapid degradation has been of forest and range resources that provide the raw 
material production of charcoal in Somalia - extracted predominantly from slow growing 
dry deciduous bush land and thicket species of Acacia and Commiphora.  

 

Charcoal Ready for Export  

Degraded rangelands due to tree felling to meet the increasing charcoal demand are a 
common sight across Somalia. The north-east and north-west regions are impacted most 
due to steep topography and occurrence of frequent flash floods leading to the formation of 
deep gullies. Land degradation is most advanced around the main roads leading to the 
ports, water holes and wells, where the diminished carrying capacity of the rangeland no 
longer supports the feeding requirements of the animal populations. As such, the capacity 
of denuded rangelands to sustain the pastoral economy is already under irreversible loss 
threatening the medium to long-term sustainability of pastoral systems. A recent study by 
Food Agriculture Organisation (FAO) / Somalia Water and Land Management Information 
System (SWALIM) for Puntland estimates the annual rate of  Acacia bussei decline at about 
5% in Puntland, and this rate seem also to be applicable across Somalia. According to a 
WFP report, the charcoal output of north-east Somalia in 1996 was estimated to be in the 
order of 4.8 million sacks [each weighing 25-30 kg]. Producing such a volume, required 
cutting approximately 2.1 million  Acacia bussei trees. At an average density of 60 trees per 
hectare, this translates into a deforestation rate of 35 000 hectares of land per year1. 
Extrapolating the above figures for production of the 10 million sacks of charcoal produced 
in the South Somalia during 2011 [only export], means felling 4.375 million trees or 
clearing 72 916 hectares of land. Considering the above mentioned extent of  Acacia bussei 
tree felling in Somalia and no re-plantation, this species was placed on the Red List of 
threatened species in 20092 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN).  

The increasing loss of the natural resource base throughout Somalia is a key contributing 
factor in determining the severity of Humanitarian Crises- as evidenced during the most 
recent drought event to hit the region in 2010, the impacts of which are still in effect today. 
The centuries old coping strategies employed during periods of drought in the arid/semi-
arid climate of Somalia are increasingly becoming impractical as resource depletion 
removes the natural resource assets which are heavily relied upon during drought events. 
The evergreen drought-tolerant indigenous vegetation species, that provides feedstock to 
the pastoralists during drought years, has been lost to the demands for charcoal. The 
resilience and coping mechanisms of communities and their livestock are currently 
reduced to a level where even a low-intensity drought cycle forces them to face huge losses 
and depend on external assistance. The shocks from such natural disasters are 
unprecedented and the 2010 drought provides the evidence of the severity and magnitude 
of such events when over 4 million Somalis (40% to 50% of total population) and millions 
of unaccounted for livestock population were impacted. With Somalia ranked at number 7

out of 233 countries and regions in global ranking3 to the impacts of the climate change - 
the losses due to such recurring shocks will only increase in the future unless determined 
efforts are made to enhance the coping capacities of the large vulnerable population.  

1.5. Renewable Energy Potential Mitigation and Adaptation 
 

Somalia is rich in renewable energy resources, untapped hydropower, extensive 
geothermal energy resources, many promising wind sites, and abundant sunshine, which 
can produce solar power. The major obstacles to development of these potentially available 
energy resources are political, financial and institutional. Traditional biomass fuels such as 
firewood and charcoal, primarily used in rural and poor communities, account for 82% of 
the country's total energy consumption. 

Somalia, despite the prolonged civil conflict and least development status, has a great 
potential to achieve sustainable development and to contribute in the reduction of Green 
House Gases (GHG). There are already signs of recovery that could utilize renewable 
energy, including solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy resources. There are 
some development initiatives in solar energy utilization in the capital Mogadishu and some 
cities in Puntland and Somaliland. Wind energy was in use prior to the civil war, but the 
infrastructures, which were mainly in Mogadishu were destroyed. The Fanoole Dam in 
Middle Jubba, which was constructed with assistance from China, from1977 to 1982 at a 
cost of about US $ 50 million, currently needs rehabilitation for irrigation and 
hydroelectricity generation. In addition, there was a plan to construct the Bardheere Dam 
upstream of the Fanoole Dam, which was interrupted by the civil conflict. In addition, there 
are considerable renewable energy potential throughout Somalia as indicated by a recent 
report of Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), 
(FGS, AfDB, 2015). The solar energy potential ranges from 5 to 7 kWh/day with over 310 
sunny days in a year, which amounts to 2500 to 3000 hours of sunshine per annum.  

 

1.6. Solar Energy 
Average solar potential stands at 5-7 kWh/ m2/day. With over 3,000 hours of high and 
constant sunlight annually, Somalia is ideally placed to utilize solar energy. Solar resources 
have been utilized for off-grid generation in the country, as well as for water heating for 
municipal buildings. Solar cooking has also seen some uptake in the country, and solar 
power is seen as the energy source of choice for the rehabilitation of many municipal 
buildings in the country, particularly health centers. 

                                                        

3 Center for Global Development; 2011-12 Rankings of the impacts of Climate Change.  

The Norwegian Nordic International Support Foundation (NIS) donated 700 solar powered 
lights to Mogadishu City. An estimated 3,300 solar powered lights were also donated to 
Mogadishu Council by the Turkish government and other donor agencies. The Benadir 
Electric Company (BECO), which is the dominant private agency that provide electricity for 
Mogadishu, is expected to mount soon solar equipment that will generate 5 Megawatts. 
Solar equipment for other 10 Megawatts (for two sites) are expected to arrive in 
Mogadishu in the near future. Numerous, new standby generators (diesel) that support 
power generation will also arrive with the solar equipment.  In addition, in the town of 
Qardho, Puntland in North East Somalia, the water wells are powered by solar energy. In 
addition, a private company call "Be Safe" in Mogadishu, is advertising: the selling and 
installing solar power for homes, schools, health centers and businesses.  

Existing power generation in Mogadishu by BECO is predominantly by diesel generators. 
Therefore the introduction of 15 MW of solar power would avoid the emission of 
greenhouse gasses by 75,000 tCO2. 

The European Union (EU) in collaboration with the Adventist Development and Relief 
Agency (ADRA) launched  the 3 year "Somali Energy Transformation (SET) Project, which 
is intended to provide 100,000 households in Somaliland, Puntland and South Central 
Somalia with sustainable and affordable solar energy service that would contribute, also, to 
a low carbon development (Warka and Mareeg.com-Hargeisa, 04/03/2015). 

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with funding from the Government of Japan, 
installed solar powered water system in the village of Las Dacawo, in Somaliland. The 
water system includes: 10 solar panels with generation capacity of 1,500 Watts, a storage 
tank with a capacity of  25,000 liters and 7 km pipeline providing water to a school, a 
health center and 5 sheltered taps water kiosks (UNICEF, Somalia, Water and Sanitation 
Hygiene, March 5, 2013)  
 

1.7. Hydroelectric  
 The Fanoole Dam in Middle Jubba, was constructed with assistance from China, from1977 
to 1982 at a cost of about US $ 50 million. The dam had the potential to irrigate 13,000 ha 
and generate 4,600 KW of electricity.  Although the dam had the capacity to irrigate about 
13,000, however,  only 1,800 ha were developed prior to the civil conflict. In addition, the 
1998 El Nino rains changed the path of the river flow, but the dam still stands and needs 
extensive rehabilitation and directing the river to go through it. In addition, there was a 
plan to construct the Bardheere Dam, upstream with a generating capacity of 493 MW, but 
the onset of the civil war interrupted the project funding and implementation.     

1.8.  Wind 
Wind speeds vary from 3-11.4 m/s. Four 50 kW turbines were installed in Mogadishu in 
1988. Wind energy has also been utilized for water pumping, with installations made by 
the UN Trusteeship Administration of Somalia from as early as the 1940s. However, these 
facilities no long exist due time and the civil war. The country has large areas of shallow sea 
along its coastline, particularly suitable for off-shore wind power, with the added benefit 
that this resource is close to a number of major urban centers, including Mogadishu and 
Berbera. Studies estimate that approximately 50% of the land area of the country has 
suitable wind speeds for power generation and 95% could benefit, and profit, from 
replacing diesel-powered water pumps with wind systems. 

1.9.  Stakeholders' Engagement in the INDCs Process  
The participation of key stakeholders in the formulation and implementation of INDCs is 
beneficial in terms of awareness, strengthening, validating and creating acceptance of the 
policy makers, civil society, academic institutions, private sector and development 
partners. Therefore, in order to achieve high level commitment from all stakeholders, there 
is a need for a well planned stakeholders dialogues based on: (i) information sharing and 
awareness raising for advocacy; (ii) arranging consultation meetings with key 
stakeholders; and (iii) setting long term planning for the implementation of INDCs process. 

 

1.10.  Feasible Mitigation and Adaptation Policies and Actions for 

INDCs 

The potential remedial actions to overcome the deforestation and rangeland degradation 
are: (1) sustainable land management and food security through enhanced productivity; 
(2) integrated water management; (3) reducing risk among of vulnerable populations from 
natural disasters; (4) the utilization of renewable energy resources such as solar, 
hydroelectric and wind. These sources were used in the past or are in use in Somalia and 
their potentials are well known; (5) the implementation of the UN Security Council 
Resolution 2036 (2012) that calls for international cooperation to ban illegal export of 
charcoal from Somalia and the various laws passed by the Somalia's authorities both 
federal and some states; (6) the introduction and advocating the use of more efficient kilns 
for charcoal making and efficient stoves for local use, in order to reduce trees filling for 
local use; (7) reforestation using regional nurseries and forest plantation using indigenous 
and introduced suitable tree species. Such initiatives could reverse the deforestation and 
land degradation.  

  

Some of these remedial actions are indicated in the National Adaptation Programme of 
Action (NAPA) (2013) formulated by UNDP and UNFCCC with funding from the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) and the Somalia: Energy Sector Needs Assessment and 
Action/Investment Programme (2015) formulated by the Federal Government of Somalia 
and the African Development Bank (AfDB).

Build Resilient Rural Livelihoods and Enable National Food 
Security 

 

RATIONALE 

Around 65% of the Somali population are rural and engaged in pastoral, agro-pastoral, 
subsistence agriculture, and charcoal production, as livelihood options. All of these 
livelihoods are heavily reliant on - and severely deplete in the case of charcoal - the natural 
resource base and provision of ecosystem services. The sustainability of ecosystems to 
support pastoralist and agricultural livelihoods, are under threat from a combination of 
loss of vegetation and grazing land, deforestation due to charcoal production, loss of soil 
fertility, poor cultivation practices of productive land, insufficient dry season water supply, 
lack of alternative livelihoods, lack of alternative energy sources others than charcoal, 
physical access constraints, conflict over natural resources4, land tenure disputes, 
underinvestment in supporting activities such as rotational grazing and livestock 
production systems, and a lack of agricultural extension services.  

The NAPA consultations underlined the vulnerability of Somalia's traditional rural 
livelihoods systems to increasing climatic variability, particularly pastoralist activities 
across all of the country and agriculture activities in the south of the country. Concerns 
were raised over increases in the occurrence and severity of natural disasters, including 
extended drought events and flash flooding. Too little water is captured and stored during 
the wet season for use in the dry season.  

With existing pastoralist and farming systems and methods already under threat from poor 
land management, it was universally felt that existing climatic variability combined with 
longer term impacts of climate change would inevitably undermine the entire sector and 
result in increased rural to urban migration, increased conflict over natural resources and 
the continued loss of lives and livelihoods. For these reasons the need for comprehensive 
measures to reduce vulnerabilities of pastoralists to climatic variability while 
simultaneously increasing investment into sustainable agriculture and farming practices - 
both clearly linked by the provision of a strong natural resource base and ecosystem

2.2. Project Profile 2: Adaptation Using Integrated Water Resources 
Management to Ensure Water Access and Supply to Vulnerable 
Populations and Sectors 

 

RATIONALE 

As set out in section 2 of the Somalia NAPA document, climate change could result in a 
slight increase in the amount of rain received each year. However, the variability of rainfall 
patterns is also set to increase from an existing very high variable range. Because of this 
high variability in rainfall patterns, it is not clear how seasonal rainfall (both wet and dry 
seasons alike) will change. El Nino events, which results in delayed onset of rainfall and less 
rainfall at certain times of the year, may also become more frequent and severe in effect. 
This may have far reaching implications on the incidents of drought, floods and water 
quality within the context of a sector, which in Somalia, remains largely under-developed. 
Progressive climate change is also likely to affect the yield of ground water and shallow 
water reservoirs, from year to year. In coastal areas sea level rise is likely to increasingly 
affect groundwater through coastal erosion, surface inundation and seawater intrusion into 
coastal aquifers. 

In relation to water resources management and protection, the NAPA consultations 
revealed a number of specific concerns, notably the inability to capture and contain rainfall 
- particularly intense rainfall events that lead to flash flooding creating damage to land, 
gullying, soil erosion and loss of soil fertility, existing water supply schemes and damage to 
infrastructure. This trend is combined with frequent and persistent water scarcity events 
across the whole of the country resulting from delays in rainfall onset and an extension in 
the dry season, sometimes lasting for many months. Consequently, the need for the 
protection of water resources through integrated and strategic approaches was ranked 
second in the list of NAPA priorities.  

Priority adaptation measures that emerged from the consultation included the need for 
protection of critical water resources through the construction of medium to large-scale 
water storage infrastructure (e.g. reservoirs) including diversions for irrigation, livestock 
watering points and boreholes. Also community level infrastructure including berkeds, 
shallow wells, and ponds were prioritized. Water resources protection, harvesting and 
storage is needed during extreme events to reduce vulnerability during dry season water 
shortages.

DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT 

Water is a scarce and critical resource that is under-developed in Somalia. At the 
community level water is primarily supplied through shallow dug wells or through 
boreholes. Among the nomadic pastoralist communities, ensuring access to watering points 
is a matter of survival.  During the dry season water sources sometimes reduce significantly 
in flow and can lead to communities needing to travel far to reach alternative sources. 
Watering points have an inherent potential to act as conflict triggers between nomadic 
peoples, particularly during times of drought.  

The south of Somalia hosts the country's only two permanent rivers, the Juba and Shabelle, 
which supply water for irrigation of the country's most promising cultivatable land, and to 
urban centers including the capital Mogadishu. During intense rainfall events water is 
quickly lost to through gullying, while also removing valuable topsoil in the process. 
Groundwater resources (aquifers) are believed to exist though deep water aquifers are not 
currently accessed. Shallow water aquifers and wells are accessed ad-hoc with little 
understanding of downstream hydrological impacts. Often during periods of drought water 
is transported to areas of need.  

There is currently no coordinated oversight and understanding of Somalia's water 
resources, access and supply. This proposed project profile intends to initiate a 
comprehensive approach to managing water resources in Somalia, through developing and 
implementing an integrated water resources management approach using participatory 
and community based decision making.

2.3.  Project Profile 3: Adaptation by Reducing Risks among 

Vulnerable Populations from Natural Disasters 

 

RATIONALE 

The NAPA process has highlighted significant concerns that natural disasters (in particular 
severe drought events and flash flooding) already constitute a development risk that are 
becoming more frequent, widespread and intense across the country, with the potential to 
cause significant further loss of livelihoods and lives. Some 14 major drought events have 
been recorded in the last 50 years adversely affecting over 6 million people. Specific issues 
raised during consultations include the potential for increases in injury and death as a 
result of drought, increase in incidence of conflict over diminishing natural resources such 
as water and grazing land, significant migration and displacement of people, and loss of 
primary assets such as livestock.  

To address the risks faced by vulnerable populations during natural disasters, a climate 
risk management approach needs to be put in place that focuses not just on recovery and 
response measures, but also at prevention measures though improved management of 
natural resources such as water, forests, grazing pasture and land. Specific measures are 
required to development and implement an early warning system and put in place a 
combination of planning engineering and design measures to reduce risk. This broader 
‘preventative' as well as responsive DRR approach will require strengthening national 
disaster management authority so that is also able to coordinate and direct cross-sectortal 
ministries and institutions to deliver joint planning activities. This approach both 
reinforces and adds value to the project outputs of NAPA project profiles 1 and 2 for 
Somalia.

DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT 

The frequency of occurrence and the severity of impacts from natural disasters, such as 
drought, is apparent across all Somalia and its significance is acknowledged throughout 
government. The programmatic focus of this project profile supports the Federal 
Government of Somalia's Six Pillar Policy: in particular, Pillar 2 - Economic Recovery for 
Livelihoods; Pillar 3 - Peace building and Social Reconciliation; and Pillar 4 - Service 
Delivery for Environment. However the government currently has neither the institution 
itself - in the form of a national disaster risks management authority - or the human 
resource or intuitional capacity to address reducing risks to populations. Developing and 
implementing an early warning system will be a core component of this project.

Project budget: US$ 23,671,610 

PSG 4 Economic Foundations 
Priority 3 Promote the Sustainable Development and 
Management of Natural Resources by developing legal and 
regulatory frameworks and building capacity in key National 
Resources Management (NRM) Institutions.    

The breakdown of state institutions, protracted conflict, 
weakening of traditional systems of decision-making on 
access to resources, absence of alternative sources of energy 
and limited livelihoods options have led to unsustainable 
production and trade of charcoal, fuelled by constant 
demand for charcoal on the international market. The UN 
Security Council resolution (2036)2012 seeks international 
support to ban charcoal export from Somalia since charcoal 
exports fuel the war economy, generating revenue in excess 
of USD 15 million per annum for the benefit of militia groups 
and brokers/intermediaries who act as gatekeepers for 
exports.     
To address the challenges surrounding charcoal, the Federal 
Government of Somalia requested UN in 2013 to extend 
support for the implementation of comprehensive set of 
activities to curb illegal trade of charcoal, promote 
alternative sources of energy to reduce local consumption 
and provide alternative livelihoods to the charcoal value 
chain beneficiaries (CVCBs). The need for implementation of 
these interventions has been reiterated at the highest levels 
of the Federal and Regional Governments.  
Working Group of PSG 4 flagged unsustainable charcoal 
production as the root cause of environmental degradation 
with negative consequences for the largely natural resources 
based economy of Somalia. The Working Group unanimously 
recommended the Joint Programme on Charcoal as priority 
flagship initiative under PSG4.

2.5.  Project Profile 5: Rehabilitation of Fanoole Hydro-Electric Dam 

and Irrigation Infrastructure  

 

 

 

INTRODUCTION  

The Fanoole Hydro-Electric Dam and its supportive infrastructures were constructed with 
the assistance of China from 1977 to 1982 at a cost of about US $ 50 million. The dam and 
its canal system provided irrigation for to government owned rice and sesame farms. The 
developed irrigated pre-war area was 1,800 ha of which 700 ha was in use for rice and 
sesame production.  In addition, the project included the construction of a rice mill with an 
annual capacity of 10,000 tons and a main canal of 52 which were completed, while the 
construction of two other primary canals of 30 and 25 km were interrupted by the onset of 
the civil war.   

The potential and planned development area for the Fanoole project alone was 8,200 ha.  In 
addition, the dam generated electricity and has a potential command capacity to eventually 
irrigate 8,000 ha of sugar cane and 5,000 ha of paddy rice. In addition, the area 
downstream of the Fanoole Dam, has one of the most fertile soils in the country.   

The dam provided electricity to the towns of Jilib and Marerey. The plan was to extend the 
electricity to Jamame and other towns downstream, including Kismayo. However, the onset 
of the civil war interrupted the initiative. Also, the path of the river flow was changed after 
1998 El Nino rains as shown in the cover page photograph. Therefore, the rehabilitation of 
the Fanoole Dam is priority for the reconstruction and development of Middle and Lower 
Jubba regions. At the downstream of Fanoole, there were the important projects of Marerey 
Sugar, Mogambo Rice Project and the banana plantations in Lower Jubba. In addition, the 
Kismayo Port is the economic outlet for the Jubba Valley. The Fanoole project had 1,500 
Somali staff and workers and 42 Chinese experts and technicians. The employee had living 
quarters of 70 houses and in addition, the project had 20 storage facilities for inputs and 
rice.  

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES 

The Fanoole Dam and agriculture land were one of the most important projects in the 
Jubba valley. The key objectives of its rehabilitation are: 

1.  Rehabilitation of the Fanoole Dam's hydroelectric infrastructures; 
2.  Provision of electricity to towns downstream of the dam and re-establishment of 2 

standby generators with a capacity of 1,600 kw and a rice de-hulling machine with a 
daily capacity of 250 tons;  

3.  Rehabilitation of canals and irrigated farms;   
4.  Repairing and reversing the path of the river flow to its origin prior to damage done 

by El Nino in 1989;  

5.  Re-building of offices, stores and residential houses of about 50; and  
6.  Leasing of 90% the farm land to a joint company of potential foreign and local 

investors and 10% for farmers from the area who are currently utilizing small areas 
of the farms. 

 

Rehabilitation of the power plant would reestablish the generation of hydropower of 4.6 
MW. The plant would provide electricity for communities in Middle and Lower Juba Valley. 
Currently all electricity in this region is generated by diesel-fueled generators. Expected 
emission reductions from replacing this electricity by clean hydropower is therefore 
estimated to be around 23,000 t CO2/year. 

 

PROJECT COMPONENTS AND SUB-COMPONENTS  

The rehabilitation of the Fanoole Dam shall have the following components: 

Component 1: Rehabilitation of the Dam and its Hydroelectric Network.  

Sub-Component 1.1: Rehabilitation of the Dam and its hydroelectric equipment. 

The sub-component shall rehabilitate the major structure of the dam, the gates, and the 
turbines for hydroelectric generation, in order to regain its irrigation and electric 
generation capacity. The dam had a capacity to generate 4,600 kw of electricity, which was 
back-stopped by standby 2 generators during low level river flows. 

 Sub-Component 1.2: Provision of Electricity to Towns Downstream of the Dam. 

This sub-component is intended for the re-establishment of the electric network to provide 
electricity to the towns downstream of the dam. In the completed 1st phase the network 
reached close to Jamame and the plan was to reach to reach it, the banana plantations and 
the towns downstream, ending in Kismayo. In addition, two standby generators with 1,600 
kw, shall be re-established. 

Component 2: Rehabilitation of Primary and Secondary Canals and Reversing of the Flow of 
River to its Origin, Prior the Damage Caused by El-Nino in 1998. 

Sub-Component 2.1: Rehabilitation of the Primary and Secondary Canals. 

This sub-component is intended for the repair and rehabilitation of the canal 
infrastructures of about 52 kms, to facilitate the irrigation of rice and sesame farms and to 
regain their productive capacity. 

Sub-Component 2.2: Reversing the Path of the River to its Course, Going Through the Dam to 
its Prior to the El-Nino of 1989. 

Once the dam is rehabilitate, the course of the river shall be re-directed to it course prior to 
the damage cause by the El Nino of 1989. Therefore, this sub-component shall restore the 
capacity of the dam for controlled irrigation and the supply of electricity as it did prior to 
the civil war.  

Component 3: Rebuilding of Offices and Residential Houses and Allocation of Land to Investors 
and Local Farming Community. 

Sub-Component 3.1: Rebuilding of Offices and Residential Houses. 

There is a need for the rebuilding of offices and residential area for the management and 
the staff of the project. This shall facilitate the task of regaining the productivity of the 
project. 

Sub-Component 3.2: The Rice Mill, Farm Machinery and Vehicles for the Implementation of 
the Project.   

The crop production machinery and equipment, transport vehicles and processing of rice 
shall be acquired to facilitate production of processing rice and other products.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS  

The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), shall establish a Project Management Unit (PMU) 
headed by a General Manager (GM) with education and experience in agriculture and  

equally qualified lean staff and technicians, with main office on site and small office at MOA 
in Mogadishu.  The donor agency may also have representative in the PMU. The PMU shall 
be supervised by the Ministry and the donor. The PMU in close consultation with the MOA 
and the donor shall carry out competitive bidding of the major components of the project. 

The PMU shall produce quarterly and annual progress report to be submitted to the MOA 
and donor. The annual report shall reflect the detail budgetary expenditure and audit 
report. In addition, an annual supervision mission can be carried out by the donor and MOA 
to assess the status of implementation and lesson learned.  

Upon the completion of the construction phase of the project, the MOA shall engage foreign 
and local investors and lease the land and the electrical network to manage. Once the land 
is leased to a joint company of both foreign and local investors, such company shall manage 
the farms and electricity, while the PMU shall continue to manage the dam and the major 
irrigation infrastructures. 

 

MONITORING AND EVALUATION PLAN 

The MOA and the donor shall assess the status of the target project components at the 
initiation of the project and through periodic supervision shall evaluate the progress made. 
Such monitoring and evaluation shall be kept up by the MOA once the project is completed 
and the land and the electricity are leased to the private companies to maintain the proper 
functioning of the facilities for both private and public good.   

 

  

2.6. Project Profile 6: Project for Domestication of Indigenous and 

the Introduction of Economically Important Plant Species 

 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The project is intended to help with the domestication and introduction of economically 
important plant species as well as enable the communities to maximize the benefit through 
the planting, harvesting of commercial products from these species as well as processing 
and marketing. The initiative will also mitigate against land degradation and desertification 
which is wide spread in the country as indicated by numerous assessments and studies as 
indicate by the References section of this proposal (1-19). The project will also have 
positive environmental impact through (i) the reduction of the need for shifting cultivation; 
(ii) and the fact that most species under consideration are perennial shrubs and trees.  The 
information of these species and their possible utilization are outlined in the proposal.  

INTRODUCTION 

The Somali inhabited areas of the Horn of Africa, has several economically important plant 
species that have products that are utilized for export or domestic use for human or 
livestock consumption. However, most of these species are endangered due to over grazing, 
charcoal production and export and desertification resulting from erratic rainfall, possibly, 
due to climate change.  In addition, there are economically important plant species that are 
suitable for the local environment that can be introduced to reap their benefit for the 
farming community as well as the entire population.  

The objective of this proposal is to initiate the domestication of economically important 
indigenous species and to introduce, test and disseminate equally important species from 
areas with similar agro-ecological conditions. This initiative would enable the farming 
communities in different ecological zones to cultivate, use and market the products of these 
species. 

Domestication of Economically Important Indigenous Plant Species 

Forests and woodlands can play a central role in the fight against poverty and the quest for 
sustainable development. They provide a range of economic, social, cultural and 
environmental functions and services, ranging from biomass energy, timber and non-
timber forest products that support livelihoods and trade, to the ecological role they play in 
mitigating land degradation and climate change among others.  

They also could play a critical role for pastoralist range management particularly during 
dry and drought time. Wood is the main sources of household energy and construction  

materials for most people, and as a revenue sources. The importance of tree based 
products include:- frankincense from Boswellia species, which are naturally growing in the 
north-east, Commiphora myrrha  which produces myrrh resins, Gum Arabic from Acacia 
Senegal and Cordeauxia edulis (now endangered) which produces yicib nuts in the central 
regions . 

In 1985 Somalia was the world's largest producer of myrrh (over 2,000 tonnes) 
Frankincense used to be Somalia's 4th largest foreign currency export earner with an 
annual production of 12,000 tonnes. Due to their value, Boswella careteri, B. frereana and B. 
sacra (the preferred species) are highly prized trees with associate tenure and 
management systems. In recent years some Somali private sector companies initiated the 
extraction of essential oils from frankincense and myrrha resins through steam distillation 
in Nairobi, Kenya. However, the natural regeneration of these species is threatened by over 
grazing and land degradation. Other tree based products of potential economic value 
include henna (Lawsonia), various fruits (e.g.Tamarind) as well as many trees which 
produce important medical products. 

The other economically important indigenous and introduced plants that grow in the 
forests and woodlands, but are not adequately utilized include: 

Juniper - Juniperus carica (dayib) 

*  Azadirachta indica (neem/geed hendi) 
*  Acacia nilotica (maraa) 
* 
*  Fig, Ficus carica (berde) 
*  Aloe vera (dacar) 
*  Acacia tortilis (qurac) 
*  Acacia Senegal (galool)? 
*  Casuariana equisetifolia (shawri) 
*  Conocarpus lancifolius (damas, ghalab) 
*  Dobera glabra (garas) 
*  Tamarindus inidica (raqai) 
*  Leucaena leucophila 
*  Cadaba mirabilis and Cadaba heterotricha (higlo) 

 

Since the planting materials for these indigenous and introduced species is available in the 
country and their potential benefits are recognized, their domestication and dissemination 
could be achieved easily, because each has important uses. However, there is a need for a 
preliminary survey of the sources of the indigenous species, the location of nurseries and to 
determine key farming communities that could benefit from the initiative.  

Introduction and Adaptation of Suitable Species 

Pyrethrum: The pyrethrum daisy, which includes the two species of Tanacetum 
cinerarifolium and T. cucineum, has flowers that are used for the extraction of the safe 
organic insecticide called pyrethrin.  The natural insecticide is made from the dried flower 
heads and it was used for centuries as insecticide and lice remedy. The flowers are dried 
and pulverized and the active component of pyrethrins contained in the seed cases, are 
extracted in the form of oleoresin.  It can be applied as insecticide as suspension in water or 
oil or as powder.  Pyrthrins attack the nervous system of insects and inhibit female 
mosquitoes from biting.  It has also an insect repellent effect.  They are less toxic to 
mammals and birds and are also biodegradable and breaks down.  Kenya is a major 
producer of pyrethrum and the product is export. However, meeting the local need alone 
could be adequate justification for introduction and dissemination to farmers.  

Moringa Tree: The moringa tree or Moringa olefera is a rapid growing with long tap roots 
and few lateral roots, minimal shade and large production of high protein biomass. In 
addition , it can grow in dry sandy soil and is drought resistant. Therefore, the tree is well 
suited for use in alley cropping. Moringa leaves, flowers, pods and seeds are highly 
nutritious. The leaves have 7 times the vitamin C in orange, 4 times the calcium in milk, 4 
times vitamin A in carrots, 2 times the protein in milk and 3 times the potassium in 
bananas. All the parts of the tree has beneficial uses as shown in Table 1. 

Table 1. The Uses of the Various Parts of Moringa Tree 

Uses 
Being high in vitamins A, B, calcium, iron, and protein, the leaves 
boost the immune system, increase metabolism, nourishment of 
eyes and brain, regulates cholesterol and blood pressure and 
improve liver and kidney functions. 
The flowers are rich in calcium and potassium and juices from the 
flowers improve the production of and the value of breast milk. 
The juices also improve urination and are beneficial to urinary 
track disorders 
The immature pods can be consumed raw or cooked as green bean 
and has an oil similar to olive oil. When consumed raw the pods 
act as de-wormer. They are also rich in protein and fiber, which 
alleviates diarrhea.  
Crushed seeds plus coconut oil make topical ointment and has 
useful medical properties including: antibiotic, anti-inflammatory 
which can be used for arthritis, rheumatism and gout, promote 
urination, calming effect on seizers and can be used for the 
purification of water. 
The roots and the bark contain all nutrients that are in the seeds,

but with higher quantities. They could be utilized in small 
quantities for: cardiac and circulatory ailments, inflammation, 
digestive disorders, promotion of appetite and ointment for 
rheumatism, lower back pain and kidney pain. 

 

Karkade:  Hibiscus sabdariffa: The red hibiscus flower is dried and made into Kerkade, a 
red drink, which can be consumed as cold or hot. Karkade contains about 15-30% organic 
acids such as cyaniding, delphinidin and citric acid, which gives it pleasant taste with the 
addition of sugar. The entire plant, except the roots are edible. Fresh leaves and young 
shoots are rich in vitamins. The leaves can be added to salads or soup. The flowers are the 
most important commercial product and are usually prepared as tea, jellies and sauces. 
Karkade tea is very useful, because it has anthocyanine with high vitamin content and 
strengthens the walls of blood vessels and regulates blood pressure. It also has flavonoids - 
kvertsitin that help clean the body and protects the liver and improves metabolism in 
general. Sudan is the major producer of karkade and it is locally as well as exported to 
Europe.  

Napier Grass - Pennisetum purpureum: Is a perennial grass that has high herbage yield 
throughout the year, it controls maize stock borer by trapping the moth that lays the eggs 
on maize plant if the Napier grass is planted around the maize field. In addition, it can 
protect maize and companion crops from wend. However, its main importance is its high 
forage production, which can be sold as green or dried fodder that could be used for milk 
producing livestock as well as export animal at holding grounds and at sea. In combination 
with protein rich Leucaena leucophila, Napier grass can provide a valuable feed for 
livestock.  

Sudan Grass and Sorghum: Sorghum Sudanense and Sorghum bicolor: These two species 
can be grown as forage in association with Leucaena leucophila, a legume with high protein 
and which is now produced mainly in the country as ornamental tree. These could be 
grown in areas where Napier grass is not grown. 

Sisal: Agave sisalana: is a fiber crop, which is a renewable source of fiber that can 
contribute to the mitigation of climate change. It can be used for robes, baskets to replace 
plastic bags, pulp and paper, building materials, etc. It has a life cycle of 7-10 years each 
plant may produce 200-250 useable leafs that are 1.5-2.0 meter long and a hardy plant that 
can grow in most parts of Somalia 

Establishment of Nurseries in Key Location  

In order to achieve successful introduction and testing of both the indigenous and imported 
species, there is a need for reasonably equipped and staffed nurseries in key locations that  

are close to the target farming communities and the sources of the indigenous plants in 
North West, and Puntland as well as have permanent water sources in Shabelle and Juba 
rivers.  The suggested locations would be in the areas of Shiekh, Erigavo, Qardho, Balad, 
Afgoi and Jilib.  

In order to achieve sustainability and reduce cost, for each nursery of approximate area of 
(0.2-0.5) hectare, an agreement will be reached with progressive farmers or institutions 
that are working in crop production or forestry in the target area. In addition, horticultural 
technicians in the private or institutional facilities will be given an allowance to top-up 
their payment. This will also reduce the running cost, use existing expertise and the host 
farmer or the institution that own the facility, would be among some of the primary 
beneficiaries. 

The establishment of the nurseries will take into consideration: the agro-climatic condition 
of the target area, soil type, the availability of perennial irrigation facilities, area of land 
needed based on the estimated demand for seedlings and closeness to the target farming 
community in order to reduce the cost of transport and damage to seedlings. There is also a 
need for wind breaks and shade.  

Involvement of Local Communities in the Production and Marketing 

In order to assure success and sustainability, the local farmers and communities will be 
involved in the planning and the selection of priority species in their area. In addition, an 
attempt would be made to study the environmental and economic impact of the 
domestication of given species. An attempt would be made to determine the marketing and 
the potential for processing of the marketable products of the selected species.

2.7. Project Profile 7: Project Proposal Charcoal Production from 

Prosopis and Replacement with Crop Production  

 

INTRODUCTION  

Prosopis juliflora is noxious and invasive plant species. It denies other plants water and 
sunlight.  It is highly competitive due to the following factors: (i) it is fast growing and 
nitrogen-fixing; (ii) it is tolerant to arid conditions and saline soils; (iii) it is deep rooted 
and was found to reach a depth of 53.3 meters (175 feet); (iv) it contains chemicals that 
inhibits the germination and the spread of other plant species where it grows; and (v) its 
seeds are spread by animals that feed on its pods, although the leaves are not palatable. 
Due to its high competitiveness it has taken over farmland, rangeland and forests. It also 
reduces the access to land because of its thick vegetation and thorns. Its thorns also wound 
animals.  Therefore, there is a need to control it and use it for the benefit of affected 
communities. In several countries, starting in India, Prosopis juliflora was successfully use 
for charcoal production and the land under it can be recovered and used for agriculture 
(Reddy, 2007). 

 

Prosopis juliflora in Somalia 

The year of introduction into Somalia is not yet clear, however, there is little 
documentation that might give some ideas about the introduction. For example AFRICARE 
(1983) reported the introduction of Prosopis juliflora in Somalia as part of a reforestation 
project for sand dune stabilization in a refugee impacted areas in the Hiran region of 
central Somalia. In this study, eighteen tree/shrub species were planted and have become 
established. Among the tree species, Prosopis juliflora out-performed all other tree species. 
The testing of Prosopis chilences as part a reforestation project in southern Somalia was 
reported by Leslie (1989). The introduction of the Prosopis juliflora in Somaliland was 
reported in 1959 by Mooney, the first forest officer to the protectorate. Mooney (1959) 
noted small experimental planting at Sheikh, Gaan Libah, Lafarug, Berbera and Manjassah. 
The species listed are Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Pinus halepensis, Prosopis sp. and Acacia 
sp. Sand dunes stabilization program started in Marka and Shalanbood in 1973. Up to 1980 
about 5,900 ha were claimed as stabilized (FAO,1984). The species used in the stabilization 
included Commiphora spp., and Anacardium occidental. No mention on Prosopis juliflora. 
The Somalis call the plant; "Keligii Noole" or "sole survivor" and "Gran Waa", "the 
Unknown", because of its aggressive take-over of range and forest lands. 

 

41 
 

Charcoal Production 

This aggressive weed species can be cut with mechanical sow or sprayed with round-up 
herbicide, which will kill it completely. However, the round-up herbicide has some negative 
health factor and mechanical sows are better option. The dry residual wood can be made 
into charcoal and be replaced by useful plants or crops, depending on the ecology of the 
target area. Communities in the affected area could be assisted to initiate the charcoal 
making and marketing as was done in some areas of India (Reddy, 2007). The communities 
could be provided with the mechanical sows at the initial stage, however, the system will 
become sustainable once the charcoal production become successful. Project costing and 
components need to be determined. 

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTING 

The project implementation and costing are yet to be determine and shall be finalized in 
consultation with the target communities and line ministries.

2.8. Project Profile 8: Up scaling the Use of Solar Energy  
 

Solar energy including: street lighting, private homes use and plans of Benadir Electric 
Company (BECO) to add three solar sub-stations into its Mogadishu grid, are good 
beginning.  In addition, in Somaliland and Puntland, the use of solar energy in private 
residences is on the increase. Therefore, given the high potential of solar energy in Somalia, 
with estimated capacity of 2,163,991,069 MWh/year, the government in partnership with 
the private sector should formulate policies and projects to extend the technology to rural 
towns and communities.  Samples of the solar street lights, in Mogadishu, which could be 
replicated, are indicated below and costing need to be determined once project scope is 
known.

consultation with government agencies and private sector involving more in depth studies 
of needs and potential.

2.9. Project Profile 9: Marine and Coastal Environmental 

Governance and Management of Somalia 

 

Somalia is located on the Horn of Africa; its Coastal line is 3,333 km long. The country has 
the potential for sustainable fish harvesting of about 200,000-300,000 tons per annum, 
however, prior to the civil war only 15,000 ton per annum were produced. In addition, as a 
result of the civil war the country experienced marine and coastal environmental 
degradation. Coastal and marine habitats and resources of Somalia suffered from habitat 
destruction,  pollution resulting from oil spillage, dumping waste and resource over 
exploitation by illegal foreign fishing vessels, rapid urbanization and coastal  population 
growth. Climate change is further exacerbating pressures on marine and coastal areas. 

Therefore, taking into account to the above stated pressures, the Office of State Minister for 
the Environment in the Office of the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Somalia will 
focus on: 

 

1.   Defining national research assessment in order to plan for coastal and marine 

environment management; 

2.  More effective and targeted dissemination of research findings; 
3.  Improving the accessibility of scientific data and information; 
4.  Promoting indigenous knowledge for management in order enhance the 

involvement of the coastal communities; 

5.  Improving the generation of knowledge through direct research programs and 

projects; 

6.  Support the development and consistency of periodic reporting of coastal  and 

marine  bordering  State  to the Federal and Regional Administrations levels; 

7.  Promoting the participation of experts, scientists, managers, decision and policy 

makers at Federal and Regional Administrations levels 

8.  Arranging National Environment on Marine and Coastal management symposia or 

conferences; 

 

POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SEA LEVEL RICE 

A rise of sea level occurs when the volume of water in ocean basin increases. For instance, 
an increase in atmospheric temperatures results in warming  and expansion of oceans, 
which results in a sea level rise. Sea level rise is therefore threatening coastal communities,  
through (a) flooding of low lying coastal lands, estuaries, deltas and salt marches; and ( b) 
affecting fish nesting and fishing grounds, e.g wetlands, and coral reefs, mangrove forests 
and marshes. 

45 
 

ACTIONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REDUCTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE 

Climate change is becoming a global problem that calls for a global solution. International 
meetings have been held to discuss the phenomena and ways to address it. In case of 
Somalia to address these matters, it is necessary to take following measures: 

1.  Raising awareness  among ordinary people would greatly minimize greenhouse gas 

emitting activities; 

2.  Saving energy- Turning off lights when not needed; 
3.  Recycling for wastes like paper, organic (food), plastic, battery, electronics,  glass, 

metals; 

4.  Reforestation, and using trees to provide shade that helps keep the soil and local 

environment cooler; and 

5.   Enhancing agricultural productivity in order to reduce the expansion of inefficient 

farming. 

 

INVESTMENT COST FOR IMPROVEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF 
COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES 

In order to restore the Marine and Coastal Environment of Somalia, including the re-
planting of mangroves,  protecting  marine species, preventing and halting coastal mining 
stones for urban construction through environmental policy, legal and regulatory actions, 
mass media awareness, arranging workshops, seminars and meetings to build up the 
capacity of the coastal communities to contribute to sustainable development of coastal 
and marine resources and to through remedial action regain depleted resources .
