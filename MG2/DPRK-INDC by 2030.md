Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of 

Democratic People's Republic of Korea 

September 2016 

1. Background 

The  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (DPR  Korea)  has  always  paid  a  great 

attention to the environment protection work in constructing the socialist power. 

The respected Comrade Kim Jong Un said: 

"Environmental  protection  work  should  be  improved  so  as  to  protect  and  increase  the 

country's resources and keep its air, rivers and seas completely free from pollution"   

Under the wise guidance of the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un, chairman of the State 

Affairs  Commission  of  DPR  Korea,  the  Republic  recently  has  made  much  progress  in 

conducting  the  forest  restoration  campaign,  thus  has  achieved  a  great  success  in 

establishing  the  sufficient  material  and  technical  foundation  for  environment  protection, 

afforestation and enclosing-with-park throughout the country. Besides, large or medium and 

small  hydro  power  stations  including  the  Paektusan  Hero  Youth  Power  Station  were 

constructed  and  much  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  the  efficiency  of  electricity 

generation and consumption, as well as in scaling up the utilization of the renewable energy. 

All these efforts resulted in the advances towards the protection of air pollution and climate 

change. 

Many  scientific  and  technological  advances  including  the  cycling  production  system  in 

agricultural  sector  and  zero-energy,  zero-carbon  architecture  in  construction  sector  have 

been  achieved  so  as  to  accelerate  the  sustainable  development  of  social  and  economic 

sectors. 

In  addition,  DPR  Korea  has  established  the  legal  and  policy  framework  to  respond  the 

climate  change  by  supplementing  the  Law  on  Environment  Protection  with  the  contents

related to climate change and newly enacting the Law on Environment Impact Assessment. 

Especially, in order to contribute to international efforts to address climate change issues, 

DPR  Korea  ratified  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change 

(UNFCCC)  on  5  December  1994,  the  Kyoto  Protocol  on  27  April  2005  and  the  Paris 

Agreement on 1 August 2016. 

As  a  non-Annex  I  Party,  DPR  Korea  prepared  the  First  National  Communication  and 

Second National Communication in cooperation with the UNEP and under the coordination 

of  the  National  Coordinating  Committee  for  Environment,  and  submitted  them  to  the 

UNFCCC secretariat respectively in September 2002 and February 2013. 

DPR  Korea  is now  making  progress  towards  initiating  the  enabling  activities  to  prepare 

the Third National Communication and the First Biennial Update Report under international 

support. 

In 1999, the least-cost GHG abatement strategy was developed under the support of the 

UNDP/GEF.   

Integrating  climate  change  considerations  into  relevant  socio-economic  development 

strategies  and  plans  is  considered  as  one  of  the  important  measures  to  ensure  the 

sustainable development in DPR Korea. Especially in accordance with five-year strategy for 

national  economic  development,  national  energy  and  climate  change 

issues  are 

simultaneously  to  be  addressed  by  improving  the  efficiency  of  electric  power  generating 

facilities and by scaling up the utilization of renewable energy. 

Pursuant to decisions 1/CP.19, 1/CP.20 and 1/CP.21 of the Conference of the Parties to 

the  UNFCCC,  the  Government  of  the  DPR  Korea  is  pleased  to  prepare  its  Intended 

Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). DPR Korea's INDC includes a mitigation and an 

adaptation component. 

The mitigation component includes both unconditional and conditional contributions. The 

unconditional contributions are measures that will be implemented using domestic resources. 

With domestic resources, GHG emissions will be reduced by 8.0% by 2030 compared to the 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Democratic People's Republic of Korea

Business as Usual scenario (BAU). The conditional contributions are measures that could 

be implemented if additional international financial support, technology transfer and capacity 

building  are  received.  The  national  contribution  could  be  increased  up  to  40.25%  with 

international support. 

The adaptation component describes the adaptation needs raised in terms of institutional 

arrangement, financing, capacity building and technology transfer by 2030. It also presents 

the prioritized adaptation measures. 

When considering the development priorities and adaptation needs in DPR Korea as one 

of  developing  countries,  international  support  for  developing  countries  under  the  Paris 

Agreement is required to encourage DPR Korea to scale up his mitigation measures to the 

level contributable to addressing climate change, an international issue on a global scale. 

DPR  Korea  will  continue  to  make  efforts  to  achieve  the  contribution  beyond  the  level 

committed  in  this  report,  based  on  the  effective  mobilization  of  domestic  resources  and 

international  support,  and  thus  will  actively  contribute  to  achieving  the  objectives  of  the 

UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.

Usual scenario 

(BAU) 

DPR  Korea's BAU  scenario for  GHG emissions  was  developed 
based  on  the  assumption  of  economic  growth  in  the  absence  of 
climate change policies. 

-  GHG emission projections for 2020: 116.36 million tCO2e 
-  GHG emission projections for 2030: 187.73 million tCO2e 

The  BAU  scenario  projection  will  be  revised  to  include  more 
the  National 

information  with  preparation  of 

accurate 
Communications and Biennial Update.

Unconditional 
contribution 

Based the on national circumstances, common but differentiated 
responsibility  and  its  capability,  DPR  Korea  will  reduce  GHG 
emissions  by  8.0%  compared  to  BAU  scenario,  by  2030  with 
domestic resources. 

Conditional 
contribution 

DPR Korea could achieve the additional contribution equivalent 
to  32.25%  of  the  GHG  emission  in  the  BAU  scenario  by  2030  if 
international  support  is  received  through  international  cooperation 
including the financial support under the Paris Agreement. 

 

2.2 Fair and Ambitious 

DPR Korea's GHG emission is 65 714GgCO2e in 2000, which accounts for 0.16% of the 

World GHG emission in 2000 (40GtCO2e). With the GHG emission of 2.9tCO2e per capita in 

2000,  DPR  Korea  is  one  of  low  GHG  emitting  countries  in  terms  of  emissions  per  capita. 

GHG emission per capita will be increased to 6.5tCO2e in 2030, but it will be still below the 

world average. 

Considering the significance of energy issues in ensuring the sustainable development, 

DPR  Korea  continue  to  give  national  development  priority  on  the  work  to  keep  energy 

production ahead of economic development. But there are no domestic oil and natural gas 

resources in DPR Korea. Thus domestic coal accounts now for a comparatively large share 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Democratic People's Republic of Korea 

 

Page 5 

 
 

 

 

 
of  energy  consumption  in  energy  and  industrial  sector.  This  share  has  a  tendency  to 

increase with the activation of the national economy in the near future. 

In order to make national contribution to mitigation of climate change fair and ambitious in 

this  development  context,  DPR  Korea  attaches  the  mitigation  priorities  to  the  energy  and 

industrial sector in where it is possible to pursue synergy with adaptation to climate change, 

and thus expects to decrease GHG emission per final energy use and GDP.     

DPR  Korea's  GDP  per  capita  is  462US$  in  2000.  This  implies  that  capability  of  DPR 

Korea for mitigation measures with only domestic resource is not sufficient to contribute to 

responding the climate change, an issue on a global scale.       

Especially, international support has a great potential to encourage mitigation measures 

in DPR Korea, because this INDC expects that conditional contribution takes about 80% of 

the national GHG emissions mitigation target in 2030.     

2.3 Legal and Policy Framework to Support the Implementation of 

National GHG Mitigation Measures 

DPR Korea has strengthened national legal and policy framework for responding climate 

change  in  a  way  of  integrating  climate  change  into  various  laws  and  mid-  or  long-term 

strategies. Measures to achieve the GHG emissions mitigation target during 2021-2030 will 

be  supported  by  the  following  relevant  laws  and  policies  in  the  fields  of  environment 

protection, energy and forest sector. 

-  Law on Environment Protection, Law on Environment Impact Assessment, Law on Air 

Pollution Protection 

-  Law on Wastes Disposal, Law on Sewer 

-  Law on Energy Management, Law on Coal, Law on Electric Power, Law on Residential 
Fuel, Law on Medium and Small Power Plant, Law on Crude Oil, Law on Renewable

3. Adaptation Component 

 

 

Annual mean temperature in DPR Korea rose by 1.9oC over the 20th century. It is over 3 

times  compared  to  the  rate  of  global  warming.  In  the  late  21st  century,  annual  mean 
temperature in DPR Korea is expected to rise by 2.8oC to 4.7oC compared to the average 
(8.2oC, 1971-2000).     

Sea level in DPR Korea by 2100 is expected to rise by 0.67m to 0.89m compared to 2000. 

Thus coastlines in the East and the West Sea may retreat by 67m to 89m and 670m to 890m 

over 100 years, respectively. 

In the late 21st century, water resources (surface water) in DPR Korea are expected to be 

almost  the  same  as  the  average  (1971-2000)  or  decrease  by  7.9%.  In  the  future,  it  is 

expected that severer flood than the present will appear during rainy season, severe drought 

that  the  present  will  appear  in  spring.  In  addition,  loss  in  land  resources  and  land 

degradation will be accelerated by increase of flood, landslide and draught events.     

The  general  goal  of  adaptation  strategy  to  climate  change  in  DPR  Korea  is  to  recover 

degraded  natural  eco-environment,  improve  its  function,  establish  economic,  social  and 

environmental  structures  coping  with  climate  change,  and  raise  up  adaptation  capacity  to 

negative impacts of climate change into the advanced level.     

Especially, the basic direction of the strategy is 

Firstly,  to  establish  the  whole  social  spirit  for  adaptation  to  climate  change  through 

strengthening public awareness raising and technology transfer, and through supplementing 

and  completing  laws,  regulations,  institutions  and  management  systems  related  to 

adaptation to climate change. 

Secondly,  to  carry  out  adaptation  measures  to  minimize  negative  impacts  to  climate 

change, reflecting them to the national strategy for development of science and technology, 

energy and agriculture, etc. 

Thirdly, to ensure investment for the work to minimize loss of life and property, and build 

the  national  capacity  for  prevention  of  disastrous  events  through  establishment  of  the 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Democratic People's Republic of Korea 

 

Page 11 

 
 

 

 

 
national  real  time  monitoring  system,  early  warning  system  and  enhancement  of 

corresponding capacity of central and Government bodies to natural disasters such as flood, 

draught, forest fire, landslide, typhoon, and tidal wave, etc., caused by climate change. 

Fourthly,  to  build  research  and  development  capacity  related  to  adaptation  to  climate 

change  and  to  train  technicians  and  experts  through  various  opportunities  and  processes 

such as university education, training and practice, etc., and to contribute to improvement of 

people's  living  and  sustainable  development  of  the  country  through  concentration  on 

research, development and introduction of advanced adaptation technologies and methods.   

Fifthly,  to  establish  the  system  for  efficient  water  resources  management,  scientific 

agricultural  production  and  advanced  medical  care  corresponding  to  negative  impacts  of 

climate change. 

Sixthly, to encourage the work to effectively cope with negative impacts of climate change 

so  as  to  draw  all  social  members  into,  and  to  actively  speed  up  bilateral  and  multi-lateral 

cooperation with international organizations and other countries. 

The  measures  in  the  following  table  are  prioritized  among  adaptation  measures  for  a 

purpose of successful implementation of the adaptation strategy.

DPR Korea will exert efforts in strengthening national financial and technical capacity to 

make progress in the implementation of these measures, in order to successfully responding 

the posible negative impacts of the climate change.   

However, international support has a great potential to help implementation of adaptation 

measures  in  DPR  Korea,  one  of  developing  countries  experiencing  now  limitation  for 

adaptation  to  climate  change,  in  terms  of  financial  resource,  capacity  building  and 

technology  transfer.  It  will  also  contribute  to  the  mobilizing  domestic  resources  and 

strengthening the political framework for mitigation of climate change. 

The monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the adaptation component will be 

reflected in the National Communications and the Biennial Updated Reports submitted to the 

UNFCCC.
