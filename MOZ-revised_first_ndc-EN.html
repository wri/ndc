  <h3>INTRODUCTION TO MOZAMBIQUE'S NDC 1 UPDATE</h3>
  <p>MOZAMBIQUE submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) to the UNFCCC on 1 October 2015 which became Mozambique's First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 1) 2020 - 2030 on 04 June 2018, the date on which the country became Party to the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>This document presents Mozambique's NDC 1 Update, which was prepared following a participatory approach in which the public and private sectors including civil society and academia were also involved with technical assistance from various international partners. The process of updating NDC 1 took place in the context of the spread of COVID-19, combined with the climatic shocks that affected the south of the country at the beginning of 2021 and the military insecurity in some locations in the central and northern regions of the country, combined with weak global demand, led to a downward revision of the economic outlook initially outlined for 2021, with the growth rate falling from 2.1% to 1.5%.</p>
  <p>In this way, reflecting the expected progress in vaccination and the extension of fiscal support in the major economies, with repercussions associated with the global economy and the maintenance of monetary policies, the global economy is expected to grow around 4.9% by the year 2022, and the Mozambican economy is expected to recover slightly, growing at a rate of 2.8% conditioned by the prices of the main commodities on the international market that may boost economic growth in the country. This scenario is based on continuing to respond to Public Health Emergencies as part of the response to the negative impact of COVID 19, with the implementation of the COVID-19 Response Plan through vaccination of 80% of the target population by 2022, providing health assistance to displaced populations and strengthening the Health Emergency Operational Centre.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, it should be noted that the State's economic planning points to the need to incur increased expenditure to deal with the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate events (costs beyond those foreseen in this NDC for adaptation). This will require increased external borrowing to fund investment projects linked to national development. Estimates based on current trends indicate that to meet these needs external credit should increase from 39,904.0 million ZZM in 2022 to 64,805.9 million ZZM in 2024<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, it should be noted that Mozambique is a country that is already facing the adverse impacts of global climate change and in view of the great national socio-economic vulnerabilities, the losses and damages associated with extreme climate events are generating additional difficulties and challenges to the development of the country and the fight against extreme poverty. Since the latest data presented in NDC 1, the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) has conducted a preliminary analysis of the costs required for reconstruction following extreme climate events and other emergencies since 2016. The figure below graphically presents the annual and accumulated figures from 2016 to 2021 of the country's needs regarding the costs necessary for reconstruction after extreme climatic events linked only to the Rainy Season, considering the sectors of Education (classrooms), Health, Agriculture, Miscellaneous Infrastructure and Assistance, as well as the amounts allocated and the deficits identified during the period analysed. This analysis shows a growing financial deficit process related to the impacts linked to extreme climatic events and emergencies, which during the period under review has already reached over 8.2 billion meticais.</p>

  <p><img width="706" height="453" alt="image" src="img/MOZ-NDC1-1.png"></p>
  <p>The commitment to actions to address global climate change is real, measurable and grounded in genuine national sovereignty, however, the large and growing barriers of finance, technology transfer and training & capacity building faced by Mozambique are undeniable.</p>
  <p>Thus, Mozambique indicates that the implementation of the adaptation and emission reduction actions foreseen in NDC 1 are conditional to international climate support. The country received from the NDC Partnership support that made it possible to budget the proposed NDC actions and identify the commitments whose realization already had international climate support secured.</p>
  <p>This document, as well as Mozambique's NDC 1, includes contributions on adaptation and mitigation, and identifies the financial, technological and capacity building barriers that the country has for its implementation. In terms of both adaptation and mitigation, this document has incorporated dozens of adaptation, mitigation and cross-cutting actions, measures, projects and policies that together would represent a total investment demand from 2020 to 2025 of around USD 7.586 billion. For comparison purposes, according to the World Bank, the country's nominal GDP in dollars in 2020 was about USD 14 billion<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>On one hand, regarding the specific contribution on adaptation, this update has considered several documents elaborated under the Convention and that have relevant information on vulnerability and adaptation measures, namely, the Mozambique National Strategy for Climate Change (ENAMMC), Technological Action Plan (for Adaptation covering agriculture and coastal zones and infrastructure and mitigation the energy and waste sectors), the Local Adaptation Plans (123 districts with local adaptation plans formulated by October 2021), the Second National Communication of Mozambique and other strategic documents including consultations with sectors and other relevant entities, the adaptation contribution is presented in this document.</p>
  <p>In chapter 2 below, details on Contribution on Adaptation are presented, including specific sections on Vulnerabilities of Mozambique, Climate Scenarios, Adaptation & Resilience Measures, and Climate Risk Reduction. Among the main sectors that are included in the portfolio of adaptation actions, measures, projects and policies are: Early Warning System, Agriculture and Fisheries, Water Resources and Sanitation, Health, Biodiversity, Forestry, Social Security, Infrastructure, Urban Areas, Settlements and Tourism and Coastal Zones, Communication, Education, Capacity Building and Awareness, among other cross-cutting ones. It should be noted that in relation to the Health sector, the World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the Ministry of Health (MISAU) and the National Institute of Health in strengthening the National Health System to the Impacts of Climate Change and in drafting the Plan for Adaptation of the Health Sector to Climate Change.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the contributions associated with the mitigation theme count on the implementation of actions, measures, projects, policies and programmes that contemplate the sectors of Agro-livestock and Sustainable Land Use, Waste Management, Energy Security and Sustainability of Industries. Mozambique is recognized as one of the countries that has been most dedicated to and developed national systems for scaling up emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation and increasing carbon sinks (REDD+), as evidenced by the fact that it is one of the first countries to receive payment for results under the Forest Carbon initiative with the World Bank. Thus, for Mozambique REDD+ was included in this updated NDC 1 as a key means of implementation to operationalise mitigation ambitions.</p>
  <p>Finally, Mozambique proposes to carry out a series of mitigation actions that in aggregate expect to achieve a reduction of GHG emissions by about 40 million tCO<sub>2</sub>eq between 2020 and 2025 (see graph below). These reductions are estimates with a significant level of uncertainty and will be updated with the results of the BUR to be available in 2022. It should be noted that, it was decided not to include as part of the mitigation contribution of this updated NDC 1 the removals and emissions from the commercial-scale tree planting (<i>afforestation</i>) component, due to the uncertainties of how such emissions and any emission reductions achieved by the activities of this component will be accounted for under the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>In addition to the uncertainties already identified, we also highlight the lack of clarity on how the accounting rules used to comply with the NDCs will be, especially on the interpretations of how such rules will reflect on the scope of articles 5 and 6, especially on the implications linked to the cooperative approaches provided for in Articles 6.2 and 6.4, and possible accounting processes for the so-called "corresponding adjustments". Although they are not included, Mozambique clarifies that it reserves the right to reconsider their inclusion. The implementation of any proposed reduction is conditional on the provision of financial, technological and capacity building support from the international community. Finally, in chapter 3 below, information is presented to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of the mitigation contribution of this NDC 1 Update, following the requirements and guidelines set out in Decision 1/CP.21.</p>
  <p>The emission reductions proposed in Mozambique's mitigation contribution would represent a mitigation effort of about 1.2 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq per capita by 2025, a very relevant figure when compared to Mozambique's total GHG emissions per capita which were respectively 0.6 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq in 1990 and about 2 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq today (total emissions with LULUCF). Just for comparison purposes the per capita emissions of developed countries (listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC) in the base year (1990) and in 2019 were respectively 16 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq and 12 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq (total GHG emissions per capita without LULUCF). Globally these values are 6 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq and 7 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq when accounting for total GHG emissions per capita with LULUCF. Figure 03 below, graphically presents such values presented above to facilitate visual comparison between emissions and emissions reductions per capita and comparison of what would be the approximate per capita emissions scenarios for mitigation routes to achieve temperature rise of up to 1.5°C and 2°C.</p>

  <p>This document is thus the result of the process of progression of ambition in various aspects such as adaptation, mitigation, transparency and international support. It is also reiterated that this updated NDC 1 document was prepared in an environment of uncertainty due to the measures imposed by the emergence of new waves of infections from COVID-19, natural disasters and military instability in some locations in the centre and north of the country. The country recorded a negative real growth of 1.2% in 2020, this reflects the negative effects of COVID-19 on economic activity during the second quarter, with the sectors that were most affected being hotel and restaurant services (-35.8%), extractive industries (-25.6%), trade (-5.7%), manufacturing(-5.3%), transport and communications (-4.7%).</p>
  <p>In addition to the budgeting of mitigation and adaptation contributions contained in this document, we highlight the cooperation received under the NDC Partnership, which supported the mobilization and coordination given to the country aimed at updating this updated Mozambique NDC 1. It is important to highlight Mozambique's participation in the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency - ICAT that supported the development of the Strengthened Climate Transparency Framework. It is also reiterated that the existence of a robust response presented in this updated NDC 1 in terms of mitigation transparency is evident by contemplating the content of the ICTU table (presented in the next chapter).</p>
  <p>Additionally, this update of NDC 1, also represents a significant progression in terms of expanding the country's ambition towards climate action in aspects of its adaptation commitments, comprising that dozens of actions will be implemented, among others, through the emerging <i>Public Investment Management (PIM) Climate Smart PIM</i> assessment system coordinated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, supported by the World Bank and NDC Partnership. One of the technical outputs was the assessment of the public budget investments related to climate change already disbursed and proposed for the years 2020 to 2022<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Such dynamics demonstrate that Mozambique is in a process of defining budget lines that aims to ensure that at least a small portion of the adaptation and mitigation actions and programs foreseen in this NDC are captured and already included in the State budgets. This dimension of mainstreaming climate change into the Public Investment Management Assessment system will contribute to the authorities adopting the guidelines including climate considerations aligned with the new law on the State Financial Administration System (SISTAFE).</p>
  <p>These advances will contribute to increased fiscal and climate transparency, increasing the efficiency of public spending through the process of pre-assessment and approval of projects planned by the State of Mozambique before they are funded on social and economic impact, as well as, in particular, on vulnerability considerations and other aspects of global climate change.</p>

  <h3>CONTRIBUTION TO ADAPTATION</h3>
  <p>This chapter describes the adaptation and risk reduction actions that the country commits to undertake in the period 2020 - 2025, aimed at making Mozambique more resilient to the impacts of climate change, reducing climate risks to people and goods as much as possible, restoring and ensuring the rational use and protection of natural and built capital (MICOA, 2012).</p>
  <p>It should be noted that the strategic actions presented in the adaptation component of Mozambique's NDC are part of the adaptation and climate risk reduction pillar of the ENAMMC, which covers the following sectors and/or areas considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change: climate risk reduction; water resources; agriculture, fisheries, food security and nutrition; social protection; health; biodiversity; forests; and, infrastructure, urban areas, other settlements and tourist and coastal zones.</p>

  <h3>VULNERABILITY OF MOZAMBIQUE</h3>
  <p>The previous version of Mozambique NDC 2020-2030 analysed the extreme events that occurred in the country in the period 1980 to 2016 and indicated that floods, tropical cyclones, droughts including epidemics are the events that most affect the population, who live in prone areas. Floods are the most frequent event followed by tropical cyclones. This trend has changed a little in recent analyses covering the period 1980 - 2019, which show tropical cyclones as the most frequent event, followed by floods and followed by droughts (see graph below). This small change is influenced by the phenomenon that occurred during the 2018/2019 rainy season during which the country was affected by two tropical cyclones IDAI and Kenneth and tropical depression Desmond.</p>
  <p>Figure 4 TOTAL NUMBER OF EXTREME EVENTS FROM 1980 – 2019</p>
  <p><img width="392" height="265" alt="image" src="img/MOZ-NDC1-4.png"></p>
  <p>According to the previous figure, it can be concluded that on average, the country is affected by a tropical cyclone or flood event every two years and a drought event every three years. Tropical cyclone and flood events account for about 77% of the total events that occurred in the period under review. The direct impact of these events is often expressed by the number of human lives lost, people affected through loss of personal property and livelihoods, destruction of the country's critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, water supply system, schools, hospitals, as well as the outbreak of water borne diseases (e.g. malaria, cholera, diarrhoea etc.). However, the lack of systematic and homogeneous recording of events and their impacts and, on the one hand, the persistence in considering only large-scale and high-impact disasters over a short period of time have hidden thousands of small and medium-scale disasters that occur every year in the country. Consequently, Mozambique does not know the real value of direct and/ or indirect economic losses associated with these events.</p>
  <p>It is observed that the events that struck the country in the 2018/2019 rainy season are those that caused the most suffering in people's lives and those that recorded the most losses and destruction. For instance, the tropical cyclones IDA and Kenneth, which occurred in the 2018/2019 rainy season, these resulted in losses in livestock due to the death of 5,428 cattle, 10,305 small ruminants, 3,191 pigs and 124,498 poultry; in fisheries, 2,189 vessels were destroyed and 77 engines damaged, 2,387 fishing gear units lost and 5,210 tonnes of fish lost; in fish farming, 562 ponds and 228 cages totally destroyed and 396 tonnes of fish lost. Water supply and sanitation was affected by cyclone IDAI in 2019 and according to assessment by the expert team, 705 water supply boreholes and wells were destroyed affecting about 211,500 people, 47 water supply systems of cities and secondary towns were paralysed which created restriction in water supply to 1,639,244 people. Some 189,953 household latrines and septic tanks were submerged, forcing 416,047 people to return to open defecation with serious consequences for public health.</p>
  <p>Regarding the agriculture, water and energy sectors, these were also affected by events during the rainy seasons from 2016/17 to 2019/2020. According to the table below, about 2,960 power poles, 95 water sources were destroyed and 1,529,389 ha of crops were affected.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, more than 30 districts are prone to drought and the population living in these districts is deprived of water supply sources for human consumption, for the irrigation of small vegetable gardens and for watering livestock. The lack of access to potable water and the exposure and frequency of droughts on the one hand, and the existence of deep aquifers in the interior of the country with fresh or brackish water on the other hand, make it difficult to access safe water supplies and limit the development and well-being of families living in these regions. The country needs infrastructures to develop Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Systems that are sustainable, safe and resilient to the risk of climate change, including the taking of measures aimed at protecting public health, preserving the water supply systems and, to this end, the country must develop Water Safety Plans, the exploration and development of deep aquifers as an alternative water supply in areas affected by drought and the construction of small water storage infrastructures for human consumption and irrigation, as well as the establishment of an optimum network for Water Resources Monitoring. It should be noted that the occurrence of extreme events has affected the environment and ecosystems, areas that are rarely evaluated for the damage caused.</p>
  <p>In addition to the losses and damages registered with the occurrence of extreme events, the country has annually allocated resources that should fund socio-economic development activities for search, rescue, human assistance and reconstruction actions aimed at alleviating the suffering of the affected people. These actions are supported by national citizens, the private sector, civil society organisations and cooperation partners.</p>
  <p>The support needs accumulate from event to event and year to year due to the frequency and intensity with which extreme events occur. Figure 01 (introduction chapter above) shows the amounts required for search and rescue, responding to the needs of the affected and post-disaster reconstruction, the amounts mobilised and the shortfall in the sectors of education, health, water supply, sanitation, various infrastructures and, mainly, for assistance to the affected.</p></p>

  <h3>CLIMATE SCENARIOS</h3>
  <p>The vulnerability analysis done in the Second National Communication considered the climate projections developed by INGC "Studies on Climate Change Impacts on Disaster Risk in Mozambique Synthesis Report - Second Version" in 2009.</p>
  <p>The methodology of the INGC study was based on climatological modelling (temperature and rainfall) with the main purpose of understanding how Mozambique's climate may already be changing and how it may be expected to change in the future. This study details the observed changes in the country's seasonal climate over the period 1960 to 2005, in terms of temperatures and rainfall patterns (INGC, 2009).</p>
  <p>Both historical trends and future projections were derived from daily temperatures (maximum and minimum) and recorded rainfall values since 1960 from 32 synoptic weather stations within Mozambique (INGC, 2009).</p>
  <p>Seven general circulation models: ECHAM, GFDL, IPSL, CCCMA, CNRM, CSIRO and GISS were used to project future climate (temperature and rainfall) scenarios for the country, focusing on the mid-century (2046-2065) and late-century (2080-2100) periods.</p>
  <p>INGC (2009) projections anticipate that CC in Mozambique will manifest itself mainly in the following:</p>
  <h4>TEMPERATURE STANDARDS</h4>
  <p>The atmosphere - with an average increase between 1.5°C and 3.0°C in the period between 2046 and 2065 and a record of more warm days and fewer cold days, with an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures;</p>
  <p>The oceans - with a rise in average sea levels and a change in the distribution and availability of fish stocks and effects on marine ecosystems (such as corals);</p>
  <h4>PRECIPITATION PATTERNS</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>With irregular rainfall behaviour in terms of starting and ending times, rainfall load (intense precipitation phenomena in a short space of time) and duration of the rainy season (drought), disfiguring the notions of "official start" and "real start" of the agricultural campaign, which may result in some regions in a reduction of current potential yields in the order of 25%;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>With the growing reduction in potential agricultural yield levels of up to 20% in the main crops that constitute the basis for food security and an indispensable condition for improving the per capita income of Mozambican families;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Increased frequency and intensity of extreme events (droughts, floods and tropical cyclones);</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Persistence of the extraordinary flood situation in identifiable places in the country that can be referred to as "risk areas";</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Cyclones and other strong winds;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Prolonged droughts;</p>
      <p>Sea level rise: 15 cm, 30 cm and 45 cm as a consequence of thermal expansion and 15 cm, 110 cm and 415 cm as a consequence of the reduction of the continental ice caps in the years 2030, 2060 and 2100, respectively;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Identified areas with increased risk potential due to the emergence of other adverse natural phenomena such as the loss by submergence and erosion of coastal areas, saline water intrusion and desertification;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Reduction of areas available for agriculture in green or low-lying areas;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Many of the country's main coastal urban centres, including Maputo, Beira and Quelimane, are already in a critical situation in terms of vulnerability (human lives, property, social infrastructure, etc.) to the effects of climate change.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

        <p>Mozambique developed the BAU scenario based on the sum of mitigation actions for the period 2020 to 2025, proposing expectations for annual emission reductions.</p>
        <p>In the year 2016, total emissions without LULUCF were estimated at about 35 MtCO eq 2and, using data and methodologies appropriate to national circumstances, estimates of projections of each mitigation action and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it is projected that in 2025, if the policy actions and programmes presented in this NDC are not implemented, emissions in 2025 will be about 54 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq without LULUCF. Based on assumptions of economic and population growth and, it is expected that the country can cumulatively mitigate about 40 MtCO eq 2in the period 2020 - 2025.</p>
        <p>The contributions associated with the theme of mitigation count on the implementation of actions, measures, projects, policies and programmes, which include the sectors of Agro-livestock and Sustainable Land Use, Waste Management, Energy Security and Sustainability of Industries. Mozambique is recognized as one of the countries that has been most dedicated to and developed national systems for scaling up emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation and increasing carbon sinks (REDD+), as evidenced by the fact that it is one of the first countries to receive payment for results under the Forest Carbon initiative with the World Bank. Thus, for Mozambique REDD+ was included in this updated NDC 1 as a key means of implementation to operationalise mitigation ambitions.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mozambique proposes to carry out a series of mitigation actions that in aggregate expect to achieve a reduction of GHG emissions by about 40 million tCO<sub>2</sub> eq between 2020 and 2025. These reductions are estimates with a significant level of uncertainty and will be updated with the results of the BUR to be available in 2022. It should be noted that, it was decided not to include as part of the mitigation contribution of this updated NDC 1 the removals and emissions from the commercial-scale tree planting (afforestation) component, due to the uncertainties of how such emissions and any emission reductions achieved by the activities of this component will be accounted for under the Paris Agreement.</p>

        <p>AFollowing the ratification of the Paris Agreement by Parliament in 2017, the then Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development submitted to Camões Institute for Cooperation and Language of Portugal the project "Roadmap for the Implementation of Mozambique's Nationally Determined Contribution - NDCMoz "with the aim of designing the roadmap for the implementation of Mozambique's NDC, contributing to the implementation and success of the Paris Agreement, through a country with a low carbon and resilient development and to the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In parallel, the country benefited from the World Bank and NDC Partnership initiative through which it intended to support the Government to prioritize the operationalization of Mozambique's NDC targets in the sectors of: agriculture, energy, water, transport and early warning system, aligning them with government policies and priorities.</p>
        <p>These two initiatives were harmonised to cover all sectors of the Mozambique NDC 2020 - 2030, and enabled a broad consultation process with stakeholders, including business sectors, provinces and civil society representatives to prioritise the actions to be included in the NDC and the format in which they should be presented. The implementation of these two initiatives resulted in the formulation of the Mozambique NDC 2020 - 2025, the Mozambique NDC Operationalisation Plan 2020 - 2025, which details the actions of the NDC. On the other hand, Mozambique has benefited from the support of the NDC Partnership which has resulted in the formulation of the NDC Partnership Plan that identifies both the project and capacity building needs for the implementation of NDC.</p>
        <p>These documents were approved by the Council of Ministers at its 38th Session, held on 11 December 2018. However, some actions of the Mozambique NDC 2020 -2025 and the respective Mozambique NDC Operationalization Plan 2020 - 2025 lacked relevant information for the process of measuring/monitoring, reporting and verifying both the actions and the support. On the other hand, there was a need to have updated inventories, as the estimated contributions in NDC 1 were based on the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report 1995 - 2004.</p>
        <p>It is in this context that Mozambique has submitted in the two calls made by the NDC Partnership - Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP I and II), requests for assistance to adjust its NDC to the Transparency Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines. Under this support it was possible, amongst other results, to update the NDC budget and identify actions whose implementation is conditioned to international climate support and those that are not conditioned; formulate project ideas for priority actions conditioned to international climate support; formulate Mozambique's Long Term Low Carbon Development Strategy 2020 - 2050; update energy sector statistics; integrate NDC into planning and budgeting processes; detail NDC actions; formulate National Adaptation Plan for the Health Sector; develop Local Adaptation Plans; strengthen gender sensitivity in Mozambique's NDC actions; and, design terms of reference for developing emissions factors for the energy and waste sectors.</p>
        <p>Other initiatives that contributed to the improvement of Mozambique's NDC are: (i) the Initiative for Transparency in Climate Action - ICAT which supported in the formulation of the Strengthened Framework for Transparency including capacity building of technicians; and, the project to formulate the First Biennial Mozambique Transparency Report (PBTRM).</p>

        <p>These competences are attached to the National Directorate of Climate Change which has in its structure the departments of adaptation and mitigation in the Ministry of Land and Environment.</p>
        <p>Considering the cross-cutting nature of climate change and the need for the involvement of state and non-state actors in both the formulation of national climate change response instruments and their implementation, including biennial reporting and review commitments, monitoring to support the production of national communication and regular updating of the NDC, the Inter-Institutional Group on Climate Change was established, composed of representatives from the public and private sectors and civil society relevant to the implementation of adaptation and climate risk reduction and mitigation and low carbon development actions including cross-cutting actions (capacity building, technology development and transfer, financing, awareness raising education, etc.).</p>
        <p>The members of the GIIMC have the responsibility to:</p>

  <p>It is important to mention that for the elaboration of Local Adaptation Plans, multi-sectoral teams have been created at provincial and district level that support local communities in the process of assessing their vulnerability and identifying and prioritising adaptation measures including the identification of potential local development partners.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the Ministry of Land and Environment has established the holding of a National Climate Change Conference every two years as a forum open to public participation to, among others, share information, experiences and good practices in the area of climate change; promote education and public awareness on issues related to climate change; and, promote the dissemination and discussion of issues relevant to climate change. The First National Conference took place this year with the participation of actors from central, provincial and district levels and the second Conference will take place in 2023, the year in which the country will be preparing its First Biennial Transparency Report.</p>

  <p>The Republic of Mozambique is a country located in the southern hemisphere, on the southeast coast of the African continent. It has an area of 801,590 km²2 of land and about 13,000 km² of internal waters. The eastern part of the country is bathed by the Indian Ocean and has a coastline of approximately 2,700 km². Administratively, the country is divided into 11 Provinces. The provinces are currently divided into 154 districts which, in turn, are subdivided into 419 local administrative districts called Postos Administrativos. In addition to these subdivisions, there are 53 municipal autarquias, located in the main cities and towns throughout the country. Along the coast there are numerous islands, such as the archipelago of Quirimbas in the province of Cabo Delgado, the Island of Mozambique and the islands Goa and Sena in the province of Nampula, the archipelago of Bazaruto in Inhambane, the islands of Inhaca, Portugueses and Xefina in the province of Maputo.</p>
  <p>Data from the Anuário Estatístico 2015, estimates that Mozambique had about 25.7 million inhabitants, with about 52% being women and 48% men. According to the results of the last population census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics in 2017 indicate that the Mozambican population was 27.9 million, and the percentage of women and men remained the same. INE population projections indicate that by 2025 Mozambique will have about 34.1 million inhabitants, thus projecting a net population expansion of over 6 million inhabitants. With regard to the distribution of the population by age group (table below), particularly between 2017 and 2025, there is a decrease in the population aged between zero and 14 years old; a growth throughout the period in the population aged 15 - 64 years old as well as a growth in the population aged 65 years old and over.</p>

  <p>The average life expectancy is 54 years, being 51 years for men and 56.5 years for women. Portuguese is the official language of the country, however, there are more than 40 languages spoken throughout the national territory.</p>
  <p>Agriculture is the mainstay of the Mozambican economy, employing more than 80% of the country's economically active population (PEDSA, 2011). Furthermore, it is the sector with the highest average share in GDP, with more than 20% of the total. Manufacturing is the second sector with the highest contribution to GDP (13%), followed by trade and transport and communications services with an average of 10% each. The national economy has considerable potential in the primary sector due to the existence of various natural resources capable of serving as a basis for creating a competitive advantage in various productive sectors. For example, ICF International (2012) and Biggs (2012) have documented that Mozambique has one of the world's largest reserves of natural gas (estimated at 250 trillion cubic feet) and coal (estimated at 25 billion tons). Other natural resources include forests, grasslands, inland waters, 2,400 kilometres of coastline and minerals (FAO, 2006). The main challenge is the development of industries that enable their sustainable exploitation and transformation. Diversification of the national economy is another challenge for more stable, comprehensive and sustainable growth. After several years of growth of around 7%, the national economy experienced a slowdown in 2016, growing by only 3.8%, down from 6.6% and 7.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decline was mainly due to the drought registered in the central and southern areas of the country, and the floods in the central and northern regions, having negatively affected the agriculture sector and electricity production, among other international and national conjunctural factors.</p>
  <p>The climate of Mozambique is diverse. Due to its location in the inter-tropical zone, manifestations of the humid tropical, dry tropical, semi-arid tropical as well as altitude-modified climate can be found throughout the country. Of these, The most predominant climate is the humid tropical with some pockets of the semi-arid tropical, characterised by having two very distinct seasons, one hot and rainy from October to April and the other cold and dry from May to September (Gelcer et al., 2018). Average rainfall is variable from south to north. The north receives the highest averages, ranging from 800 mm to 1200 mm. In the centre and south, they are comparatively lower compared to the north and vary from the coast to the interior. The annual averages in the two regions range from 1000 mm to 600 mm and 800 mm to 300 mm, respectively.</p>
  <p>In Mozambique, the energy sector is experiencing a remarkable growth in the last two decades, both in terms of production and consumption of electricity and natural gas. However, despite this increase, the majority of the population (77%) continues to depend on forest biomass, such as firewood and charcoal, to meet its energy needs because it lives in rural areas and the electrification of the country, which is estimated at around 34%, is still below expectations. However, the government has been making efforts to reverse the current scenario through rural electrification, which is estimated to average 120 000 new connections per year over the last 15 years (MTA, 2021).</p>
  <p>Currently, the national electricity generating capacity is estimated at 2905 MW. Of these, 1045 MW are for domestic consumption and 1,860 MW are for export to neighbouring countries, indicating that the country produces more than it needs for its consumption. The vast majority of the energy generated in the country is from hydroelectric sources (90%) and the remaining 10% is from natural gas. Among the hydroelectric plants, HCB stands out the most with an installed generating capacity of 2075 MW, equivalent to 79.4% of the capacity of the other plants and 71.4% of national generation. Recent studies conducted in the country, indicate a huge potential for renewable energy production (Renewable Energy Atlas, 2014), with an estimated capacity of about 23,000 GW of solar resources, followed by hydroelectric sources with 19 GW, wind potential with 5 GW and biomass resources with 2 GW. Of this potential, the government has prioritized the production of 5,645 MW from hydropower sources, 600 MW solar, 1,146 MW wind, 128 MW biomass and 20 MW geothermal energy as a way to accelerate universal access of energy services by the population, climate change mitigation as well as for sustainable use of biomass resources (MTA, 2021).</p>

  <p>Under the Initiative for Transparency for Climate Action - ICAT Mozambique formulated in 2018, in Phase 1 of ICAT, the Roadmap for establishing a Strengthened Transparency Framework in Mozambique. This Roadmap came to be implemented in 2020 and resulted in the formulation and approval of the Mozambique National Strengthened Transparency Framework (QNFTM).</p>
  <p>The process of formulating the NTSF was participatory involving public and private sectors and entities, civil society and academia through consultations to, among others, review and validate the monitoring elements of the NDC; present and validate the objectives of the institutional arrangements for the National MRV System; present the proposed Enhanced Transparency Framework; present the model reports on climate change adaptation and mitigation actions; undertake group work to review the proposed Enhanced Transparency Framework and model reports, and achieve consensus on the documents under formulation in plenary discussions for validation.</p>
  <p>Thus, the QNTFM was developed to systematically produce the following reports: Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), National Communication (CN) and the Implementation Report of the National Strategy for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change (RI-ENAMMC), including the following interim reports, the National Inventory Report (RIN), Implementation Report of the Nationally Determined Contribution (RI-AAMMC) and Adaptation Communication (AC) (Figure below).</p>
  <p>The QNTFM has the following systems: Measuring and Reporting System, Verification System and the Academy's Technical Support. In turn, the Measurement and Reporting System is sub-divided into two, one to Measure and Report GHG emissions and removals in the energy sectors including transport, IPPU, AFOLU and Waste - GHG Inventory and the second to Monitor and Report (track) adaptation and risk reduction, mitigation and low carbon development actions and the support received and required contained in the ENAMMC, NAP, NDC and LTS (the latter in formulation).</p>

      <td>
        <p>Considering Mozambique's historical emissions, which are insignificant in the global calculation, the effort that the country needs to make to build adaptive capacity and the national challenges of poverty reduction including the most vulnerable, we consider our contribution fair and appropriate in order to pursue the ultimate objective of the Convention. This NDC has been prepared in an environment of uncertainty due to the measures imposed by the emergence of new waves of infections from COVID-19, natural calamities and military instability in some localities in the centre and north of the country. The country recorded negative real growth of 1.2% in 2020, this reflects the negative effects of COVID-19 on economic activity during the second quarter, with the sectors that were most affected being hotel and restaurant services (-35.8%), extractive industries (-25.6%), trade (-5.7%), manufacturing (-5.3%), transport and communications (-4.7%). The spread of COVID-19, combined with the climatic shocks that affected the south of the country at the beginning of 2021 and the military insecurity in some regions of the Centre and North of the country, associated with weak global demand, led to a downward revision of the economic outlook initially outlined for 2021, with the growth rate falling from 2.1% to 1.5%.</p>
        <p>In this way, reflecting the progress of vaccination and the extension of fiscal support in the major economies, with repercussions associated with the global economy and the maintenance of monetary policies, a growth of the global economy of around 4.9% is forecast for the year 2022 and that the Mozambican economy will recover slightly, growing at a rate of 2.8% conditioned by the prices of the main commodities on the international market that may boost economic growth in the country. This scenario is based on continuing to respond to Public Health Emergencies as part of the response to the negative impact of COVID 19, with the implementation of the COVID-19 Response Plan through vaccination of 80% of the target population by 2022, providing health assistance to displaced populations and strengthening the Health Emergency Operational Centre.</p>
        <p>However, the need to incur expenses to mitigate adverse climatic shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic, makes it necessary for external credit to increase for investment projects. It is estimated by the growing trend of current external resources that these will increase from 39,904.0 million ZZM in 2022 to 64,805.9 million ZZM in 2024.</p>
        <p>It is recognised that the pursuit of resilient, low-carbon development can be a driver for poverty reduction, reduced inequities for the most vulnerable and post-COVID green economic recovery19. Thus, the implementation of the NDC will take into account the most vulnerable groups in communities, promoting climate-proof and inclusive development with increased access to efficient technologies and clean energy, prioritising environmental integrity, human health and the creation of green jobs.</p>
        <p>Thus, Mozambique's NDC is fair in that it responds to the country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, post-pandemic challenges of COVID19 and puts on the table its contribution as a developing country.</p>
        <p>It is also ambitious because it presents a reduction target to be achieved by the years 2020 and 2025, that is, an expected reduction of about 40 million tCO 2eq by 2025. The emission reductions proposed in the mitigation contribution of Mozambique would represent a mitigation effort of about 1.2 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq per capita by 2025, a very relevant figure when compared to the total GHG emissions per capita in Mozambique which were respectively 0.6 tCO 2eq in 1990 and about 2 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq today (total emissions with LULUCF). Just for comparison purposes the per capita emissions of developed countries (listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC) in the base year (1990) and in 2019 were respectively 16 tCO 2eq and 12 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq (total GHG emissions per capita without LULUCF). Overall these values are 6 tCO 2eq and 7 tCO<sub>2</sub> eq when accounting for total GHG emissions per capita with LULUCF. Figure 03 presented in this updated NDC 1, graphically presents such values presented above to facilitate visual comparison between per capita emissions and emissions reductions and comparison of what would be the approximate per capita emissions scenarios for mitigation pathways to achieve temperature rise of up to 1,5°C e 2°C<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>

        <p>Mozambique as a least developed country has no obligation under the Paris Agreement to undertake NDC actions that are not conditional, particularly considering that due to the nature of its development and land management, it has not historically contributed to relevant GHG emissions.</p>
        <p>Thus, part of Mozambique's contributions in the mitigation area are conditioned to international climate financial, technological and capacity building support to be received from abroad, as well as capacity building.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in the spirit of increased ambition and in order to demonstrate Mozambique's commitment to fighting global warming, the country has developed, with the support of the Climate Action Transparency Initiative - ICAT implemented by UNEP-DTU the national framework for strengthened transparency - the MRV System that will help the country measure, report and verify actions and support received and requested.</p>
        <p>Within this framework, Mozambique expects to prepare and submit, on time, national communications, biennial update reports, biennial transparency reports and update the NDC.</p>
