  <h1><a>Executive Summary</a></h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Mauritius’ net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2016 were 4,881 kilo tons carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO2eq), including removals from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), representing less than 0.01 percent of global GHG emissions. However, the Republic of Mauritius is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mauritius submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributios (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat on 28 September 2015 ahead of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) to the UNFCCC. The INDC was complemented by the NDC Action Plan prepared in February 2016.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mauritius’ commitments to combat climate change are ambitious given its national circumstances. This ambition is reflected in the mitigation and adaptation strategies and measures in which the Government of Mauritius has committed since the ratification of the Paris Agreement, and will continue to be engaged in.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>The Climate Change Act was gazetted on 28 November 2020 and it entered into force on 22 April 2021.</strong> Under the Act, the Department of Climate Change is responsible to coordinate the implementation of relevant commitments to ensure compliance with the international climate change agreements. An Inter-Ministerial Council on Climate Change is provided to set national objectives, goals and targets with a view to make Mauritius a climate resilient and low emission country. A Climate Change Committee has also been set-up to enable a multi- stakeholder participation for the preparation of the national climate change strategies and action plans for mitigation and adaptation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In light of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and in view of different national circumstances, and the principles of flexibility as inscribed in the Paris Agreement and decision 18/CMA.1, Mauritius reporting and transparency will improve over time. In this context, Mauritius NDC may be subject to future improvements, corrections, recalculations and/or modifications. Following the submission of this NDC, Mauritius will develop an Action Plan including details about policies and measures on mitigation and adaptation.</p>
      <h2>MITIGATION</h2>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Based on current projections, Mauritius aims to reduce overall GHG emissions by 40% in 2030 compared to the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario of around 6,900 ktCO2eq (including LULUCF) in 2030. Compared to the 2015 INDC target of 30% GHG emissions reduction by 2030, the mitigation ambition of Mauritius in this updated NDC is significantly enhanced.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>This economy-wide emissions reduction target comprises sector specific mitigation targets for energy, transport, waste and Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU). The energy sector represents the largest share of GHG emissions reduction by 2,311 ktCO2eq.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mauritius confirms its commitment to implement policies and measures on LULUCF and Agriculture sectors in line with its national policy and strategy documents on climate change and sustainable development.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Several key decisions have already been taken by the Government of Mauritius to implement this NDC within the 2030 timeframe for the energy sector, including, as a matter of example the following:</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>the production of 60 percent of energy needs from green sources by 2030;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>the total phasing out of use of coal before 2030 and the development of the biomass framework;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>an increase in energy efficiency by 10 %, based on the 2019 figures.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
          <h2>ADAPTATION</h2>
      <p>10. Mauritius actions on adaptation are centred around the 2021 Updated National Climate Change Adaptation Policy Framework that focuses on the potential of nature-based solutions for adaptation and provides a new policy orientation in key adaptation sectors to build resilience as it follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The enhancement of the knowledge base regarding the risks of climate change and the impacts on communities;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Developing and implementing an integrated approach which combines the following sectors namely; Fisheries (Blue Economy), Tourism, Biodiversity (Terrestrial and Marine), Forestry, Agriculture and Coastal Zone;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Enhancing strategic frameworks to address policy gaps and improve expertise in the Health sector, including, through integrating climate risks into planning and developing policies in the National Adaptation Plan; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Increasing resilience of human-led activities whilst preserving ecosystem functions, through improving governance, enhancing disaster preparedness and response mechanisms, for infrastructure and disaster risk reduction sectors.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>11. Building on current adaptation actions and policies, a more detailed list of actions is provided in the part on Adaptation Communication.</p>
      <h2>MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
      <p>12. The implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions as identified in this NDC is unconditional as well as conditional on external financial support received.</p>
      <p>13. The total financial needs to implement the NDC targets are estimated at <strong>USD 6.5 billion</strong>. The total needs for implementing the <strong>mitigation</strong> and <strong>adaptation</strong> actions identified in this NDC are estimated respectively at <strong>USD 2 billion</strong> and <strong>USD 4.5 billion</strong>.</p>
      <p>14. The share for the unconditional<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and conditional contributions for the USD 6.5 billion is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Unconditional</strong> amount of <strong>USD 2.3 billion</strong> (from government and private sector) representing 35%; and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Conditional</strong> amount of <strong>USD 4.2 billion</strong> (from international sources and donor agencies) representing 65%.</p>
    </li>

        <p>Fishery / Blue economy: i) increased information on GHG emissions from the fishery sector and aquatic food production leading to mitigation actions (regarding fuel and energy use, market forces and the management of fishing capacity, feed and fertilizers for aquaculture , ii) development of climate smart fishery and aquaculture based on sustainable and integrated management plans to contribute to the mitigation of GHG emissions during the fishing and production stages and throughout the entire value chain (processing, transport and marketing activities), and iii) research regarding the potential of aquaculture for carbon sequestration and renewable aquatic energy (algal biofuels, hydropower and other aquatic-based energy systems that exploit the energy potential of tides, currents, waves and wind).</p>
        <p>Biodiversity: i) assessment and monitoring of blue carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems (mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses), ii) a comprehensive ecosystem-management, iii) joint efforts (with local communities, NGOs) to restore ecosystems and, thus, the carbon storage capacity (mangrove, forest, coral reef rehabilitation), iv) tree planting programme within the context of the Greening Mauritius Programme such as greening of motorway and major roads in towns and villages, undertaken to increase carbon sink, and (v) creation of new endemic forests.</p>
        <p>Water: i) increased energy efficiency through the sustainable use of water resources, in particular by improving energy efficiency in the treatment of water resources, and the use of water in energy production.</p>
        <p>Buildings and infrastructures: i) integrating energy efficiency and energy conservation criteria into building codes targeting a lower consumption of energy (better ventilation for less/no RAC and thermal comfort), the design of green buildings (training of the architect and stakeholders), ii) integrating soft engineering and green material (including Life Cycle Assessments of the materials and buildings, the reuse and recycling of materials, principles, requirements and guidance regarding the design for disassembly and adaptability given by ISO 20887:2020, the development of Building Information Modelling, Building Log books and material passports), and iii) global land use planning and management (in line with Mauritius Resilience Strategy for a Ridge to Reef vision to protect environmental sensitive areas ) with the implementation of setback, buffer zones, and a better management of Disaster Risks. The progress made in terms of information and communication technologies is also taken into account, given the fact that Mauritius is moving towards a more digital economy.</p>
        <p>Tourism: i) promotion of a “green tourism industry” meaning more energy efficiency, renewable energy, water efficiency, waste management, wastewater treatment, local – short value-chains for both the touristic / leisure infrastructures and the activities.</p>

Information obtained in collaboration and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, academic experts and technical consultants, served as additional inputs on the potential of future technologies for long-term mitigation in Mauritius. Based on the policy documents available, stakeholder consultations have also been carried out, including with members of the public, in order to obtain feedback on possible measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>The elaboration of the NDC included consultations with local communities (notably Rodrigues). The collaboration and consultation of representatives from the ministry responsible for gender equality were also essential for considering gender-responsive measures.

        <p>The Republic of Mauritius consists of the islands of Mauritius, Rodrigues, Agalega, Tromelin, Cargados Carajos, and the Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia and any other islands comprised in the State of Mauritius. The Republic of Mauritius has an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of approximately 2.3 million km2. It also shares joint jurisdiction with the Republic of Seychelles over an extended continental shelf area of about 400,000 km2 in the Mascarene Plateau region. The island of Mauritius has an area of 1,868.4 km2 and is made up of a central plateau gradually rising towards the southwest. Mauritius’ landscape includes ranges of mountains with peaks, isolated mountains, hills, river valleys, waterfalls, plateaus and plains form the relief of Mauritius. The country’s natural resources include arable land and access to fishing areas.</p>
        <p>Mauritius is home to 690 native species of plants of which 281 have been identified as being endemic. Plants are critically endangered (45%), 73 are endangered (26%), 35 are vulnerable (12,5%), 235 are threatened (84%), 3 are near threatened, 4 are least concerned, 7 are extinct, 10 are possibly extinct. In addition, between 2006 and 2016, 59% of plants have seen their status get worse, while only 15% have improved their status.</p>
        <p>The climate in Mauritius can be described as tropical, modified by southeast trade winds. Mauritius is characteristic by warm, dry winters (May to November) and hot, wet, humid summer (November to May). The country is highly vulnerable to climate change effects such as intense cyclones, abnormal tidal surges, prolonged droughts, flash floods, increase of sea surface temperature, and sea level rise.</p>
        <p>The country’s economy is based on agriculture, exports (seafood, textiles and apparel, and sugar), financial services, and tourism.</p>
        <p>Sustainable development</p>
        <p>Mauritius is fully committed to the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The country was actively involved in the negotiations leading to the adoption of the post- 2015 framework. Following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, Mauritius has turned its attention towards its implementation. Mauritius is currently developing its policy framework for pursuing the SDGs known as Vision 2030. Within the 2030 Agenda, Mauritius has submitted its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) Report to the High Level Political Forum of United Nations Economic and Social Council in 2019. The VNR takes stock of the unique journey Mauritius has travelled in nation building and development process aimed at transforming and modernising the country.</p>
        <p>Concerning the vulnerable groups (20% of the population) living in environmentally fragile areas in low coastal zones, actions like construction of refuge centre at Quatre Sœurs and sea wall against storm surge at Rivière des Galets, desilting and cleaning of rivers are being carried out in adjoining residential areas prone to flooding to reduce flood impacts by the government. The National Disaster Scheme 2015 is being implemented at all levels.</p>
        <p>Poverty eradication</p>
        <p>Approximately 10 % of the population in Mauritius live in relative poverty. According to the Poverty Analysis Report of Mauritius in 2017, poverty is more prevalent among specific groups such as people with low education, the elderly, single parent households, families with three or more children and women. Several actions have been taken by the national government to eradicate poverty: the Marshall Plan Against Poverty, the Social Integration (2016) and Empowerment Act of 2016, public-private partnership initiatives.</p>
        <p>In this context, special efforts are being made by the National Women’s Entrepreneur Council through several entrepreneurial projects to empower women to address gender-related poverty (70,942 out 131,300 Mauritians who were poverty-stricken, were women according to 2017 statistics).</p>

        <p>The updated NDC identifies ambitious mitigation measures to combat climate change in priority sectors (Energy, Transport, Waste, IPPU, Agriculture and LULUCF). In particular, Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement is addressed:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>An economy-wide absolute GHG emissions limitation target: This will provide greater clarity and transparency of Mauritius’ emissions level in 2030 and facilitate the tracking of progress;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Methodological updates to Mauritius’ NDC: These updates include, for example, the use of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the 100- year time-horizon GWP values from the IPCC Second AR. This demonstrates enhanced transparency in the reporting of Mauritius’ national inventory and climate actions;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Updated information on implementation efforts: Article 17 of the Climate Change Act 2020 details the process on updating information on implementation efforts, and the MRV system.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Application of ICTU guidance: This facilitates greater clarity, transparency and understanding of Mauritius’ NDC and implementation efforts.</p>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Consideration of the fairness and ambition of Mauritius’ NDC must take into account the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Mauritius has taken ambitious early actions: Mauritius made early policy choices that reduced its GHG emissions in the Long-Term Energy Strategy 2009-2025 (for example by switching from fossil fuels to renewable energies for power generation). In 2017, about 14 % of its electricity was generated from renewable energy, compared to 2000. In 2019, around 36.3% of electricity was generated from coal, 41.7% from diesel and fuel oil, and 21.7% from renewable sources. Due to an ambitious strategic plan by the Mauritius Renewable Energy Agency (MARENA), the renewable energy share rose to 23,9% in 2020. Mauritius is one of countries with numerous CDM projects. As a result, these and other earlier initiatives positioned Mauritius to achieve steep emissions reductions over the years;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Fairness: Given the size of Mauritius’ economy and its population, on a global scale the GHG emissions are insignificant (0.01 % of the global average). Nonetheless, Mauritius is, and always has been, well below world average in terms of carbon intensity (CO2/capita). As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), and a country particularly vulnerable to climate change effects, Mauritius has to continue to develop its economy, all while increasing the intensity and scale of climate change adaptation actions. Mauritius’ long-standing commitment to renewable energies will continue to contribute to a decrease in emissions compared to a BAU scenario.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Based on current projections, Mauritius aims to reduce overall GHG emissions by 40% in 2030 compared to the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario of 6895 thousand tons (including LULUCF) in 2030. Compared to the 2015 INDC target of 30% GHG emissions reduction by 2030, the mitigation ambition of Mauritius in this updated NDC is significantly enhanced.</p>

        <p>(b) Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities, as appropriate</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>A vulnerability assessment of the relevant sectors for both Mauritius and Rodrigues reveals that Mauritius is particularly susceptible to changes in precipitation and climate change induced weather events (UNDP study by Heat GmbH, 2021). However, natural hazards are not the only driver of risk in Mauritius: rapid and unplanned urbanization and infrastructure development have increased the frequency of flash flooding, causing destruction of housing, infrastructure, and crops, and putting the population at risk of vector-borne diseases, water- borne diseases. Vulnerable groups will be more affected by the impacts of disasters, and climate change.</p>
        <p>Temperature</p>
        <p>The mean annual temperature over the island has warmed by 1.39°C in the last 70 years between 1951-2020, compared to the 1961-1990 climatological normal. Projected temperature rise up to 2°C by 2061 - 2070. Projections of Mauritius Meteorological Service following BRIO Project the change is 3.14-3.64°C for SSP5-8.5<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> by 2100 (Updated National Climate Change Adaptation Policy Framework, 2021)</p>
        <p>Algal blooms due to high Sea Surface Temperature and nutrient rich seepage into lagoons are known to be the cause of mass mortality of corals and fish. More intense rainfall over the ocean is expected to cause increased sedimentation of the lagoons thus smothering the corals.</p>
        <p>Sea level rise</p>
        <p>Monitoring in the decade 1998-2007 has showed that sea level rise by 18 to 59 cm by the end of the century, with an estimated rate of increase of 5.6mm per year for Mauritius, whereas the increase yearly increase in Port Louis amounted to 2.1 mm per year.</p>
        <p>At Port Louis, during the last decade (period 2011 to 2020), analysis of sea level has increased by 8 mm per year as compared to the long-term mean rise of 4.7 mm per year (between 1987 and 2020). Sea level rise is projected to be of the order of 49 cm by 2100 (Updated National Climate Change Adaptation Policy Framework, 2021)</p>
        <p>As a SIDS, it is essential for Mauritius to take this into consideration and undertake significant adaptation measures to reduce its vulnerability.</p>
        <p>Cyclones</p>
        <p>Due to its location in the southwestern Indian Ocean, Mauritius is also exposed to cyclones. Situated at the tail of the Indian Ocean cyclone belt, the country’s exposure to cyclones has been relatively limited so far. However, according to a US study in 2020, the intensity of cyclones in the south east region has increased and the chances of a major tropical cyclone occurring increased by 18% per decade. The hurricane season usually starts in November and ends in mid-May the following year. Data from Mauritius’ Meteorological Services shows that in each decade between 1960 and 2009, more and more cyclones have been occurring, with the average annual number of cyclones doubling in this timeframe. Although most cyclones miss the islands, every year the archipelago is hit by the remnants of big storms, causing flooding of low-lying areas, resulting in significant physical damage to buildings, crops, and livestock. Other preliminary projections point to the intensification of cyclones in shorter periods of time. Cyclones and associated hazards such as torrential rains and flash floods regularly affect the country and account for 32.7% or nationally reported losses in terms of mortality between 1990 and 2014. In 2002, Cyclone Dina caused 50 million EUR losses in the sugar cane production. In 2016, Cyclone Fantala resulted in a call for the evacuation of the South Island of Agalega. In January 2019, Cyclone Berguitta caused significant damages and power outages to the main island, and in February 2019, Cyclone Gelena led to flash floods and population displacement, especially in Rodrigues Island. The mean number of cyclone with intensity higher than tropical cyclone (gusts &gt; 165 km/h) has increased from 3.9 in the period 1981-2020 to 4.7 in the period 1991-2020.</p>
        <p>Mauritius is expected to experience around USD 91 million in direct losses annually from winds, flooding, and storm surge associated with tropical cyclones<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. The estimates suggest that 50% of the loss from tropical cyclones originate from the residential sector and nearly 30% from the commercial sector. Annual emergency costs for tropical cyclones are on average estimated at nearly USD 21 million. A projection for 100-year timeframe provides an estimate of USD 1.9 billion loss to Mauritius due to tropical cyclones. Rodrigues Island tends to be more affected by the strongest winds and deepest storm surge. A 100-year event would generate winds exceeding 200 km/h (from the current registered 165 km/h). In Mauritius, flooding from tropical cyclones will be greater from the same projection.</p>
        <p>Floods and flash floods</p>
        <p>According to the country’s disaster risk profile (DRP Mauritius, 2016), flooding is the second-largest risk after cyclones, causing 20 per cent of direct economic losses associated with disasters and will experience on average around 22 million USD yearly direct losses from flooding. It is also estimated that nearly 60% of the direct losses from flooding are from the residential sector and 20% from the commercial sector. (DRM: A Capacity Diagnosis, 2020)- Cadri Partnership.</p>
        <p>Annual emergency costs for tropical cyclones are on average estimated at nearly 21 million USD. A projection for 100-year timeframe provides an estimate of 1.9 billion USD loss to Mauritius due to tropical cyclones. The study also shows that Rodrigues Island tends to be more affected by the strongest winds and deepest storm surge. On the island, a 100-year event would generate winds exceeding 200 km/h. And in Mauritius, flooding from tropical cyclones will be greater from the same projection.</p>
        <p>Because of cyclones and torrential rains, floods and flash floods are climatic hazards to which the country is exposed. Floods that are caused by heavy rains account for over 70% of disasters each year<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, it has been observed that the frequency of flash floods has been on the rise even resulting in fatalities and damage, in particular, the events of 26th March 2008, 30th March 2013 and 10th February 2016 which are still vivid in the memories of affected citizens. The Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) has observed an increased in short duration – high intensity rainfall that has led to flash floods on several occasions and in various areas over the past few years. The risk of flash floods has increased significantly with urbanization and development causing the disruption of the natural drainage system. Flash floods account for 26.2 percent of nationally reported losses in terms of mortality between 1990 and 2014. In 2002, 200 flood prone areas were identified compared to 450 in 2019 (DRM: A Capacity Diagnosis, 2020).</p>
        <p>Moreover, the 2021 UNDP GIS study by HEAT GmbH, has identified and mapped 79 flood prone areas due to agricultural runoff over a spatial coverage of approximately 373 Hectares of land. It is found through spatial analysis that mechanized sugarcane cultivation where intense de-rocking has taken place, occupied 24.6% of land use of contributing catchments of flood prone areas. The study also revealed that the percentage extent of land under mechanized sugarcane cultivation of the contributory catchments of localities which are regularly affected by flooding are due to surface runoff from agricultural land. It is imperative that necessary actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of flooding due to runoff from agricultural land and to put the safety and well-being of the citizen of Mauritius first.</p>
        <p>Flash floods and unpredictable weather conditions have today become a recurrence. During the last summer (November 2020 to April 2021), four occasions of heavy rainfall/torrential rain warning were issued as well as three events of flash flood.</p>
        <p>In order to build resilience, the construction and upgrading of some 1,500 drain projects across the island over the next three years, starting with high-risk flood-prone areas, have been planned in the Government budget 2021-2022.</p>
        <p>Landslides</p>
        <p>Mauritius has several areas identified as high-risk for landslides, with incidences over the past years having led to the destruction of housing and infrastructure. These disasters are typically the result of increased precipitation patterns in shorter periods of time, coupled with other factors such as the reduction or the lack of vegetation cover and risky constructions on sloppy areas. The risk areas are Chitrakoot, Quatre Soeurs, Vallée Pitot, La Butte, Chamarel, Corps de Garde’s ridge. The country is experiencing an increasing number of cases of landslide occurrences, which are worsened by deforestation, and bad land use planning e.g. construction on slope, close to rivers, etc. While in the late nineties there was only one dangerous site in Mauritius requiring strict precautionary measures, this number rose to 22 in 2005. Under the “Cyclone and other natural Disasters scheme 2011/2012”, 37 sites have been identified, out of which six sites (laval tunnels in Palma, and Curepipe, Riviere des Creaoles, Batellage, Olivia and Kewal Nagar, and Montagne Signaux) are classified as risk areas for which a landslide management plan is being envisaged.</p>
        <p>Rainfall and Drought</p>
        <p>With climate change, there is an increase in frequency of periods of dry spells and droughts. According to the MMS, the mean annual rainfall over the island has decreased by 104 mm over the last 70 years between 1951-2020, compared to the 1961-1990 climatological normal. Decadal analysis shows a decrease of 7.7% in rainfall during last decade, of 2011-2020 compared to the decade 1951-1960. The variability of rainfall trends caused an increase in the frequency of dry years after the 1990s with severe spell affecting the country in 1999, 2009, and 2011. For instance, the 1999 drought caused a loss of 160 million USD to the sugar cane sector, as compared to the 1998 revenue. Water crisis and resulting restrictions on water supply for irrigation caused shortages of vegetables for local consumption in 2011. Overall, droughts accounted for 96.8% of combined economic losses of nationally reported losses between 1990 and 2014. As compared to the island of Mauritius, Rodrigues is more exposed to longer periods of water scarcity.</p>
        <p>These climate change effects may lead to water scarcity, negatively impact agricultural productivity, reduce terrestrial and marine biodiversity. Extreme weather events and rising sea levels are also likely to affect infrastructure and tourism. Apart from vast socioeconomic impacts, the health of the population might be put at risk by climate change effects due to an increase in frequency of vector-borne diseases, thereby adversely affecting people’s lives and livelihoods, ecosystem services and the economy.</p>
        <p>Research shows that Mauritius may become a water-scarce region by 2030<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Projections indicate that the utilizable water resources may decrease by up to 13 % by 2050 if no action is taken to restore catchment areas<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
