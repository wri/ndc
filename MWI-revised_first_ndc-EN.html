  <h1>Malawi's NDC</h1>
  <p>REPUBLIC OF MALAWI</p>
  <p>UPDATED</p>
  <h1>NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS</h1>
  <p>July 2021</p>
  <h2>Foreword</h2>
  <p>Climate Change is recognized as one the biggest challenges humanity is facing today. It has implications for economic development, food security and poverty eradication for developing countries especially for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) like Malawi. Evidence shows that all of Malawi's socioeconomic sectors have been, and will continue to be, affected by climate change, with implications for the livelihoods of its population and social-economic development. It is evident that climate change is making Malawi's pathway to prosperity more difficult, more complex and costlier than before. Vulnerability to climate change impacts in Malawi is caused by factors such as deep–rooted poverty, high dependence on subsistence rain-fed agriculture, rapid human population growth that results in pollution and overexploitation of natural resources.</p>
  <p>Malawi's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) demonstrates the commitment of the Malawi Government to meeting its obligations towards addressing the challenges of climate change. The NDC articulates areas of priority for climate change management through both mitigation and adaptation measures needed to address challenges of climate change. It represents a decisive and reference document for implementation of Malawi's adaptation and mitigations commitments.</p>
  <p>The NDC has been developed through a consultative process and designed within the context of national development priorities. It is guided by principles set out by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Implementation of the NDC should not be considered as the responsibility of the Government alone, but its successful implementation will require concerted efforts with the involvement and participation of all stakeholders including NGOs, Civil Society, the Private Sector, Academia and the general public.</p>
  <p>While the Ministry of Forestry and Natural Resources through the Environmental Affairs Department, in its capacity as the UNFCCC Focal Point for Malawi, will coordinate the implementation of the NDC all stakeholders will be expected to implement various aspects of the NDC and report on the same, in order to allow for tracking of implementation progress. It is the Government‟s expectation to have a successful implementation that will materialize into the intended results.</p>

  <h2>Preface</h2>
  <p>The Government of Malawi recognizes the adverse impacts caused by climate change and its implications for the country. In 2015 and 2016 Malawi experienced unprecedented floods and droughts on account of climate change with negative consequent effects on socio- economic sectors and on the economy. Even though Malawi's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is very low on a global scale, it is scientifically accepted that human activities such as deforestation and land use change, consumption of fossil fuels such as coal, diesel and petrol, pollution from manufacturing industries, and improper waste management, release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which cause global warming.</p>
  <p>Following the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, Malawi in 2015 submitted and communicated the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and scale-up adaptation actions through the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). As part of its commitment to the Paris Agreement, the Government of Malawi has revised its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The NDCs embody efforts by countries that are Party to the Paris Agreement to put in place measures to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
  <p>The NDC has outlined Malawi's climate change priorities for the period from 2020 - 2040 and has provided concrete strategies for addressing the causes of climate change and responding to the adverse effects and impacts in line with provisions established under the Paris Agreement. In order to ably track progress of its implementation and funding, the NDC has been prepared together with accompanying documents that will facilitate its implementation, mainstreaming, monitoring and reporting. These are: an Implementation Plan; Mainstreaming Guidelines; a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Framework; and a Resource Mobilization Strategy.</p>
  <p>The NDC affirms government‟s commitment to fully addressing climate change issues in order to reduce the vulnerability of its people and ecosystems, at the same time contributing to socio-economic development. It is the government‟s vision that implementation of the NDC will build Malawi's resilience to overcome challenges of climate change and embrace the opportunities that are available to enable the country lay a solid foundation for a sustainable and prosperous Malawi in line with the Malawi Vision 2063.</p>

  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>This document presents the Government of Malawi's update of its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for mitigation and adaptation for the period 2015 to 2040. The contributions described in this submission build upon Malawi's existing NDC, new policies and national plans, and reflect subsequent work in developing quantifiable mitigation and adaptation targets. The updated NDC represents a more detailed and robust assessment of mitigation and adaptation measures in Malawi, including emissions reductions and estimated funding requirements, informed by in-depth analysis, improved information and data, and an extensive national stakeholder-driven consultation process.</p>
  <h4>Malawi’s climate change response</h4>
  <p>Malawi has experienced an increase in the frequency, intensity and magnitude over the last two decades of extreme weather events. Malawi is particularly vulnerable to floods, droughts and strong winds associated with tropical cyclones. The country has experienced more than 19 major flooding events and seven droughts over the past five decades and in 2015 was affected by the worst floods in 50 years; the floods affected over 1 million people, displaced 230,000 people and killed 106 people, with another 172 people reported missing. The agriculture sector suffers the greatest losses as a result of climate change impacts. Most smallholder farmers in Malawi are resource poor with very limited capacity to contain shocks arising from climate change. Economic modelling has estimated the direct overall costs due to climate change impacts equivalent to losing at least 5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) each year.</p>
  <p>Malawi's land and natural resources are heavily utilized and prone to environmental degradation, and therefore also highly vulnerability to climate change. Malawi's land resource base is particularly under threat from increasing human and livestock population pressures, and the expending agricultural production to marginal areas. Overdependence on traditional biomass (wood, charcoal) and other fossil fuels to meet the country's growing energy needs are threatening Malawi's climate as forest resources are being depleted as carbon sinks. In common with many other developing countries, the country's ongoing economic growth is highly threatened by climate change.</p>
  <p>The Government of Malawi (GoM) is committed to taking urgent action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. As a Party to the UNFCCC, the country seeks to contribute to the ambitious goal of limiting temperature rise to 2oC with efforts to reach 1.5oC agreed under the Paris Agreement. Given the challenges posed to its ongoing social and economic development, Malawi has taken significant strides towards addressing climate change, including through the development of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), a</p>
  <p>National Climate Change Response Framework (NCCRF) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). Malawi has also put in place a series of legislative sectoral frameworks and strategies to integrate environment and climate change management in socio-economic development activities, including within the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS III) and Malawi 2063. In 2016, Malawi adopted the National Climate Change Management Policy (NCCMP) which provides strategic direction for the country's priorities for climate change interventions covering both adaptation and mitigation.</p>
  <p>Despite its status as a least developed country (LDC) with one of the lowest per capita emissions rates worldwide, Malawi believes in playing its part towards achieving the goals of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The updated NDC, which draws upon the NCCMP and other national strategies and policies, therefore proposes an ambitious and wide- ranging set of measures which can significantly reduce Malawi's GHG emissions compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario of economic development and emissions growth over the next two decades. The mitigation and adaptation contributions set out in this document are therefore considered to be both fair and ambitious in the context of Malawi's national circumstances.</p>
  <h4>Mitigation</h4>
  <p>Malawi's mitigation contribution takes the form of a reduction in GHG emissions relative to a business-as-usual (BAU) emissions scenario over the period to 2040.</p>
  <p>Latest national inventory data estimate total greenhouse (GHG) emissions excluding forestry and other land use (FOLU) at 9.33 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) for 2017. Agriculture accounted for by far the largest share of the total (5.07 million tCO2e, 54% of total), followed by Energy (2.34 million tCO2e, 25% of total) and waste (1.67 million tCO2e, 18% of total). Emissions from industrial processes represented just 0.24 million tCO2e, equivalent to around 3% of total emissions in 2017 (mainly associated with calcination CO2 emissions from minerals production). Emissions from livestock represented the largest emissions source category, followed by emissions from managed soils in crop production. Following these agriculture sources, major sources included CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use in transport, which accounted for 11% of the total, and methane emissions from unmanaged waste disposal site (dumps), which accounted for 13% of the total.</p>
  <p>Under a BAU emissions scenario, total emissions excluding FOLU are forecast to increase by more than three times by 2040, rising from 9.3 million tCO2e in 2017 to 34.6 million tCO2e in 2040. This outlook reflects assumptions around the growing contribution from fossil fuels to national emissions, arising from increasing demand for thermal power generation and transport services. At the same time, despite potential for increased productivity, agricultural output in expected to be more limited, growing broadly in line with trends over the past decade.</p>
  <p>A detailed assessment of identified GHG mitigation options for Malawi estimates a total emissions reduction potential of around 17.7 million tCO2e in 2040 against the BAU scenario emissions in the same year of 34.6 million tCO2e, equivalent to a reduction of 51 per cent. Based on the analysis, mitigation measures have been grouped according to two different contributions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Unconditional contribution</strong>: A reduction of 6 per cent relative to BAU in the year 2040; equivalent to an estimated mitigation level of 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in that year. This is an unconditional target, based on domestically supported and implemented mitigation measures and policies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Conditional contribution</strong>: An additional reduction of 45 per cent relative to BAU in the year 2040; equivalent to an estimated mitigation level of 15.6 million tCO2e in that year. This represents an additional targeted contribution, based on the provision of international support and funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
      <p>The combined unconditional and conditional contribution is therefore a 51 per cent reduction in GHG emissions compared to BAU in 2040, expressed as a single year target. The coverage of the contribution includes the three main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).</p>
      <p>The sectoral scope of this contribution covers all emissions sources described in the IPCC 2006 Reporting Guidelines, including emissions from the categories of energy; industrial processes and product use (IPPU); waste; and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) but excluding sources from forestry and other land use (FOLU). These latter sources may be included within future contributions, subject to improved data availability and ongoing development in the accuracy of their quantification within the national GHG inventory. For this updated NDC, an indicative emissions reduction contribution has instead been made. This has been estimated at 59.8 million tCO2e of reductions through a range of FOLU interventions covering an area of up to 2 million hectares (Ha), of which 22 per cent is unconditional and 78 per cent conditional on international support.</p>

      <h4>Adaptation</h4>
      <p>Malawi's adaptation contribution prioritises adaptation interventions and develops sector- level performance indicators and targets. As shown in the table below, ten strategic adaptation options have been identified relating to the three pillars, namely: (i) institutional framework, (ii) knowledge, technology and financing and (iii) resilience of the most vulnerable, which support three main objectives: (i) promote an enabling environment to facilitate Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) mainstreaming, (ii) improve capacity for data and information management and sharing, and access to technology and financing for adaptation, and (iii) plan and implement adaptation actions toward an increased resilience of the most vulnerable Malawians.</p>

  <p>The updated NDC describes a sectoral framework of measures to enhance Malawi's climate adaptation and resilience, along with a set of indicators to monitor and evaluate their progress, aiming at increasing the resilience of its people, ecosystems and economy. This is fully aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and subsequently with Agenda 2030 and the sectoral planning process, along with the framework for the National Adaptation Plan.</p>
  <h4>Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) framework</h4>
  <p>The Paris Agreement contains several additional MRV requirements which, when taken together with the existing UNFCCC arrangements, provide an enhanced basis for Malawi's international reporting requirements relating to its updated NDC. The enhanced transparency framework (ETF) established by the Paris Agreement requires an MRV system to transparently report progress made towards the targets defined in Malawi's NDC and to track the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as the use and results of means of including climate finance. The system should also capture broader non-GHG impacts resulting from implementation of measures for the purposes of evaluating their contribution to achieving broader development goals.</p>
  <p>A framework has therefore been developed which provides a basis for Malawi to monitor and report on its NDC in a way which is consistent these requirements whilst also being well- aligned with existing procedures and arrangements. The framework describes the institutional arrangements for tracking the progress of the NDC and reporting on its implementation at both an international and domestic level. Alongside Malawi's NDC Implementation Plan, the framework indicates the institutions, fora, roles and responsibilities proposed to guide and support implementation of MRV of the NDC at the national level</p>
  <p>including policy and strategic decision levels. Supporting this process, a comprehensive framework of sectoral indicators has been developed according to which Malawi can monitor and evaluate its progress in meeting its NDC targets through 2040.</p>
  <h4>Means of implementation</h4>
  <p>To fully implement the mitigation and adaptation contributions described in this document, Malawi will require support in the form of finance, capacity building, and technology transfer. The total estimated cost for Malawi's identified NDC mitigation measures through 2040 is estimated at around 41.8 billion USD for mitigation measures, and around 4.5 billion USD for adaptation measures, representing a combined funding requirement of 46.3 billion USD. Of this total, around one third is estimated to be required over the next decade (2020-2030), and two thirds in the subsequent decade (2030-2040). For both mitigation and adaptation combined, unconditional measures account for around 24% of the total estimated funding requirements, and conditional measures around 76%.</p>

  <p>Challenges for climate finance in Malawi include insufficient funds, a limited domestic budget for the implementation of climate actions, and the limited involvement of private sector investment in environment and climate change activities. In response to these factors, Malawi is currently preparing a resource mobilization strategy which will identify sources of finance and strategies to fund and support the prioritised measures identified in this document.</p>
  <p>The Government of Malawi will continue to commit significant resources to climate change relevant strategies, both in relation to mitigation and adaptation. However, there is clearly also a need for increased levels of bilateral and multilateral financial support. Malawi intends to meet its conditional contribution through the use of climate finance and international market mechanisms where appropriate, building upon its experience of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and other existing market mechanisms. These include the potential involvement in international cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. As outlined in this updated NDC, technology transfer and capacity building will also be required to fully implement Malawi's mitigation and adaptation contributions.</p>
      <h2><a>1 Introduction</a></h2>
            <h3><a>1.1 Background</a></h3>
            <p>At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, on 12 December 2015, Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached an agreement to combat climate change and accelerate the actions and investments needed to achieve a sustainable low carbon future. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 following the universal adoption of the Agreement by Parties. Under the Agreement, developed and developing countries made individual commitments to transition toward a climate-resilient and low-emissions future. Importantly, the Agreement also acknowledges that achieving the ambitions of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will require a collective and concerted action on climate change.</p>
            <p>Parties are required to undertake and communicate efforts to contribute to the achievement of these goals in the form of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) communicated to the UNFCCC (Article 3). These include efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mitigation) as well as adapting to the effects of climate change (adaptation). Parties shall submit revised NDCs every five years, each representing a progression beyond the Party‟s current NDC and reflect its highest possible ambition, “as well as its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances”. The Paris Agreement also requires that in communicating their NDCs, all Parties shall provide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of their NDCs and established an Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) which specifies how Parties must report on progress in implementing mitigation and adaptation measures, and on support provided or received.</p>
            <p>Parties have been requested to submit their updated and revised NDCs to the UNFCCC Secretariat ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to be held in Glasgow in 2021. In this context, the Republic of Malawi is submitting this updated NDC. The contributions described in this submission build upon Malawi's existing first NDC, and reflect subsequent work supported by the NDC Partnership in developing quantifiable mitigation and adaptation targets, an NDC implementation plan and a monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) framework for tracking the NDC. This updated NDC represents a more detailed assessment of mitigation and adaptation measures in Malawi informed by in-depth analysis, improved information and data, and an extensive stakeholder-driven consultation process.</p>

      <h2><a>2 National circumstances</a></h2>
      <p>This section provides a brief overview of Malawi's national circumstances, including the country's vulnerability to climate change, its natural resources, and its key socio-economic characteristics.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
              <h4>2.1.1 Vulnerability to climate change</h4>
              <p>In Malawi, natural resources and the environment play a very significant role in influencing social and economic development at both household and national levels (GoM, 2016a). Approximately 80 percent of Malawians depend on renewable natural resources for their livelihoods, and the foundation of the national economy is primarily rain-fed agriculture. The success of many important sectors of the economy such as agriculture, water supply and sanitation, transport, tourism, industry, health and education relies on environment and natural resources to enhance their productivity. However, environmental degradation and climate change have emerged as major development issues that have adversely impacted on food security, water quality and energy security, thereby frustrating government efforts to improve the general livelihoods of both urban and rural communities.</p>
              <p>Scientific evidence in Malawi shows an increase in the frequency, intensity and magnitude over the last two decades of extreme weather events (GoM, 2016a). Malawi is particularly vulnerable to floods, droughts and strong winds associated with tropical cyclones. Most of the drought episodes that Malawi experiences are caused by the El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena, with serious impacts on crop and livestock production. Additionally, the country experiences long dry spells that occasionally disrupt the rainfall season and cause crop failure. The pattern of rainfall results in the seasonality of crop production, and forces farmers to stay idle during the dry season. Livestock productivity is highly constrained by lack of adequate feed and drinking water in the dry season (GoM, 2020). Over the past five decades, Malawi has experienced more than 19 major flooding events and seven droughts. In 2015, Malawi was affected by the worst floods in 50 years; the floods affected over 1 million people, displaced 230,000 people and killed 106 people, with another 172 people reported missing (GoM, 2020).</p>
              <p>The agriculture sector suffers the greatest losses as a result of climate change impacts (GoM, 2016a). Most smallholder farmers in Malawi are resource poor with very limited capacity to contain shocks arising from climate change. Food security remains a concern in many of the affected districts and agriculture production of crops and livestock continues to see only a limited increase in productivity over years because of vulnerability to climate change (GoM, 2020). Food shortages cause domestic grain prices to rise, resulting in increased grain imports which erode the foreign exchange reserves with depreciating effects on the exchange rate, and divert resource reallocation from other productive sectors. As a result, prices of other food stuffs also increase, fuelling inflation with knock-on effects on interest rates and the macroeconomic outlook (GoM, 2016a). Economic modelling has estimated the direct overall costs due to climate change impacts equivalent to losing at least 5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) each year (GoM, 2016a).</p>
              <h4>2.1.2 Natural resources</h4>
              <p>Malawi is endowed with abundant and diverse natural resources, which is a basis for sustainable economic growth and development (GoM, 2020). At the same time, the country's high dependency on these resources, many of which face challenges from degradation and overuse, increase the vulnerability of communities and ecosystems to the adverse impacts of climate change. The majority people in Malawi live below the poverty line. Under abject poverty, people are forced to heavily depend on natural resources for energy (fuel wood), food, construction material, medicine, and fodder. Poverty forces people to trade-off long term sustainable resources for short term consumption because they depend entirely on the existing natural resources.</p>
              <p>Of Malawi's total land area of 9.4 million hectares (ha) only around 31% is suitable for rain- fed agriculture at traditional level of management due to variations in topography, slope, rainfall, temperature, soil type and soil depth (GoM, 2020). This limited land resource base is heavily utilized and prone to environmental degradation, and therefore also highly vulnerability to climate change. Malawi's land resource base is particularly under threat from increasing human and livestock population pressures, and the expending agricultural production to marginal areas. Other factors that contribute to land degradation include: (i) insecure and unforeseeable property rights leading to open access exploitation for agricultural production, (ii) limited information on the costs of land degradation and the benefits of conservation, (iii) lack of access to credit for soil conservation and management practices, and (iv) poor agricultural production practices (GoM, 2020).</p>
              <p>Unsustainable use of natural resources impacts a range of important sectors. For example, the fisheries sector is one of the most economically important in Malawi, providing employment and contributing to food security for millions of rural poor Malawians. It provides about 70% of the animal protein and 40% of total protein intake for the majority of Malawians (GoM, 2020). Increasing population growth has however brought about great demand for fish for domestic consumption leading to an increase in the number of fishermen, localized fishing, and reduced fish catches. In recent years, fish landings have fallen dramatically due to overfishing and environmental degradation. Similarly, the overdependence on traditional biomass (wood, charcoal) and other fossil fuels to meet the country's growing energy needs are threatening Malawi's climate as forest resources are being depleted as carbon sinks (GoM, 2020). These important concerns are reflected in the choice of mitigation measures outlined in this nationally determined contribution.</p>
              <p>Malawi is blessed with abundant biodiversity and has diverse habitats and ecosystems including woodlands, montane grasslands, wetlands and fresh water bodies that harbour a rich variety of flora and fauna, including more than 5,000 plants and over 8,500 invertebrate species. Malawi's terrestrial ecosystems comprise forests, mountains and grasslands (GoM, 2020). The country has 87 forest reserves, five national parks, four wildlife reserves and three nature sanctuaries that were established to protect important wildlife populations, major water catchment areas, and landscapes of high aesthetic value and to preserve them for scientific and recreational uses (GoM, 2020).</p>
              <p>The greatest threat to biodiversity in Malawi is the unprecedented loss of habitats, fragmentation of species habitats and isolation of remaining communities due to unsustainable land use practices. Agriculture, urbanization, infrastructure development and human settlements are the major drivers of habitat loss and fragmentation in Malawi. The agriculture sector has been embroiled in the continuous cultivation of land in wetlands and riverbanks, encroachment into protected areas and cultivation on mountain slopes. Developmental activities have contributed to habitat loss through conversion of arable land, wetlands and forests for road construction, urbanization and human settlements. Damming of rivers for irrigation and water supply has also led to changes in ecosystems downstream (GoM, 2020). These challenges serve to further threaten Malawi's capacity to adapt to climate change impacts and provide an important context for the country's development and environmental policy priorities.</p>
              <h4>2.1.3 Socio-economic characteristics</h4>
      <p>Malawi's population was 18.1 million in 2018 and has been growing at an average rate of around 2.8% per year since 2000 (UN DESA, 2019). According to the national Population and Housing Census 2018, around 18% of the population are located in urban areas and 82% in rural areas (NSO, 2019). The population density is 168 persons per km2, making Malawi one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The overall average life expectancy is about 48.5 years, which is below the average life expectancy for Africa which is estimated at 53 years (GoM, 2020).</p>
      <p>Malawi's economy is largely based on agriculture, with the sector supporting about 80% of rural people‟s livelihoods and contributing about 30% to gross domestic product (GDP) and 80% of export revenues (GoM, 2020). The performance of the other sectors is dependent on agriculture which is largely rainfed and hence highly vulnerable to climate change and climate variability. Malawi's GDP was estimated at 6,917 USD million in 2018 (World Bank, 2020), representing an average GDP per capita of 381 USD, one of the lowest in the world and also in Africa.</p>
      <p>As well as being highly vulnerable to the increasing impacts of climate change, Malawi has been severely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicates that spill-overs from the sharp global slowdown as well as the economic disruption in the region have weighed on international trade, tourism, remittances,</p>
      <p>investment, and consumption. The national lockdown introduced to contain the pandemic has also impacted the near-term economic outlook, which has deteriorated significantly, with large uncertainties surrounding the duration and spread of the pandemic (IMF, 2020).</p>
      <p>Before COVID-19, economic growth was forecast at around 5% in 2020, with strong agricultural production, post-cyclone reconstruction, investments to build resilience to climate change, and improved electricity generation. Over the medium-term, greater access to finance, additional resilience investments, enhanced electricity generation and irrigation (e.g., the Shire Valley project), crop diversification, and better telecommunications were anticipated to boost growth to just over 6% (IMF, 2020). Growth has since been expected to fall to 1% percent for 2020 and to 2.5% in 2021, assuming it will take time for businesses to re-open after the lockdown ends and for trade flows to normalize. A gradual recovery is expected thereafter, with growth averaging 6.4% during 2022-25 (IMF, 2020).</p>
      <h2><a>3 Malawi’s climate change response</a></h2>
      <p>The Government of Malawi (GoM) is committed to taking urgent action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. As a Party to the UNFCCC, the country seeks to contribute to the ambitious goal of limiting temperature rise to 2oC with efforts to reach 1.5oC agreed under the Paris Agreement. Malawi ratified the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1994, and is line with the Paris Agreement submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2016 which became its first NDC in 2016.</p>
      <p>Given the challenges posed to its ongoing social and economic development, Malawi has taken significant strides towards addressing climate change. Through the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) (GoM, 2006), submitted to the UNFCCC in 2006, Malawi has identified sectors that are most affected by climate change including agriculture, human health, energy, fisheries, wildlife, water, forestry and gender. The Government has also developed a number of initiatives and processes to assist vulnerable communities and ecosystems to adapt and mitigate to both current and projected climate change impacts through increased adaptive capacity and resilience, enhanced carbon sinks, reduced GHG emissions, improved food security and sustainable economic development. These include the development of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), a National Climate Change Response Framework (NCCRF) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Malawi has put in place a series of legislative sectoral frameworks and strategies to integrate environment and climate change management in socio-economic development activities, including through the Malawi Vision 2020, which was the country's previous overarching long term strategy to achieve middle-income status (GoM, 1998). Malawi has subsequently prioritised climate change, environment and natural resources management within the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS III) (GoM, 2018) and has integrated climate considerations within a wide range of sectoral policies and strategies. Most recently, climate change is embedded within Malawi 2063, which sets out the country's vision to become an inclusively wealthy and self-reliant industrialised upper- middle-income country by 2063 (GoM, 2021).</p>
      <p>In 2016, Malawi adopted the National Climate Change Management Policy (NCCMP) which provides strategic direction for the country's priorities for climate change interventions through six priority areas (GoM, 2016a):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Climate change adaptation;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Climate change mitigation;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Capacity building, education, training and awareness;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Research, technology development and transfer and systematic observation;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Climate financing; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cross-cutting issues (including gender considerations, population dynamics and HIV and AIDS)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
          <p>The NCCMP acts to guide implementation of critical climate change issues and strategies, including capacity building, education, training and public awareness, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), and adaptation and mitigation within agriculture, energy, industrial processes, waste management, forestry, water resources, and wildlife sectors. The Policy serves as the country's overarching reference document for policy makers in Government, the private sector, civil society, and donors concerning climate change as a priority development issue (GoM, 2016a).</p>
          <p>The updated NDC builds upon the NCCMP in its commitment to tackling climate change through the development of both mitigation and adaption responses, as well as other key national guiding documents including Malawi 2063, the Malawi Economic Growth Strategy (MEGS), and the Malawi Growth and Development Strategies (MGDS) III. The NDC also aligns with Malawi's National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Framework, which the country developed in 2020 to guide efforts to develop its National Adaptation Plan with an effort to address climate change. The NAP Framework has built on the NAP Roadmap, validating and updating the vision, objectives and mandates for adaptation structures in the country. It reaffirmed the structure and approach for the NAP process, linking it to existing or planned policies, plans, strategies and legislation that will enable Malawi to address its medium- and long-term adaptation needs. The NAP stocktaking report prepared in 2016 served as a key foundation for the NAP Framework by reaffirming Malawi's readiness to proceed with the NAP process.</p>
          <p>Despite its status as a least developed country (LDC) with one of the lowest per capita emissions rates worldwide, Malawi believes in playing its part towards achieving the goals of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The updated NDC therefore proposes an ambitious and wide-ranging set of measures which can significantly reduce Malawi's GHG emissions compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario of economic development and emissions growth. The mitigation and adaptation contributions set out in this document are therefore considered to be both fair and ambitious in the context of Malawi's national circumstances.</p>
      <h2><a>4 NDC revision process</a></h2>
      <p>Malawi submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in October 2015 setting out its adaptation and mitigation goals to 2040. With the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in November 2016, the INDC formally became Malawi's first NDC.</p>
      <p>This updated NDC updates and strengthens the first NDC for both the mitigation and adaptation contributions, informed by improved data collection, in-depth technical analysis and extensive stakeholder engagement. In the case of mitigation, detailed sector- and project-based modelling has been undertaken to estimate the national mitigation potential and develop quantified conditional and unconditional contributions through 2040. This section provides a brief description of the revision process of Malawi's NDC for both the mitigation and adaptation components.</p>
            <h3><a>4.1 Mitigation</a></h3>
                    <h4>4.1.1 Business-as-usual (BAU) emissions forecasting</h4>
                    <p>The mitigation contribution contained in this updated NDC takes the form of a „baseline target‟. This is a deviation below a reference baseline (BAU) scenario in the absence of NDC measures, expressed as a <i>relative reduction</i> (%) between the mitigation scenario and the BAU scenario in 2040. This type of target requires estimating counterfactual projections of emissions based on a number of assumptions around what constitutes BAU (e.g. economic growth, population, planned policies and strategies).</p>
                    <p>As described further in the next section, the development of the BAU scenario used in the updated Malawi's NDC has now been undertaken at a detailed sectoral level, drawing from extensive consultation with national sector experts and stakeholders. The modelling undertaken includes economy-wide drivers of activity (e.g. fuel use, waste generation) and emissions, such as economic and population growth, as well as sector-specific factors (e.g. power expansion plans, transport strategy plans, agricultural output levels). The projections also make use of regression analysis based on latest available data to better understand and inform relationships between certain forecast model parameters. The projections make use of the most recent information and data including recently available information sources such as e.g. national population projections, official power demand and generation projections, transport and vehicle survey data, official statistics, policy planning documents etc.</p>
                    <h4>4.1.2 Identifying and assessing mitigation measures</h4>
                    <p>Malawi's first NDC identified a wide range of mitigation measures within each of the country's key emitting sectors. However, these were not assessed for their GHG mitigation potential. The analysis used to develop this updated NDC has involved identifying a range of mitigation options from within each of the NDC sectors for further consideration and quantitative analysis by several teams of consultants.</p>
                    <p>A bottom-up "long-list" was developed through close consultation with various stakeholders and experts. A modified „long list‟ was further refined, based on subsequent meetings held between the consulting teams, government officials and sector experts though late 2019 - early 2021. The projects identified in the NDC were re-assessed, as well as additional projects and programmes. In some cases, the details, and context, regarding many of the projects were found to have changed since the time of INDC submission. The "long list" of options identified thereby reflected a set of real projects and programmes under consideration, or having been studied, from within government departments and agencies. The identified measures provided the basis for the GHG emissions modelling described in the following section.</p>
                    <p>This updated NDC reflects the use of in-depth technical and economic analysis of NDC measures. As is described further below, the measures were assessed by applying mitigation modelling and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) over the period to 2040 in order to determine their emissions reduction potential against the BAU scenario, along with their socio-economic costs and benefits, including investment requirements. Alongside other criteria and following discussions with relevant national officials, these results were used to inform the choice of which measures (or shares of measures) represent unconditional measures to be funded domestically and which are conditional on the provision of international support.</p>
                    <h4>4.1.3 Consultation and coordination</h4>
                    <p>As noted above, the development of the analysis involved close consultation with government officials, experts and stakeholders. This was mainly undertaken on a sectoral basis through a list of agreed key government and expert focal points, in relation to collection of data and information as well as discussion and validation of projects, measures and modelling assumptions. The key focal points are shown below in Figure 4-1, along with their sectoral coverage, responsibility or area.</p>

                    <p>Because the measures identified for analysis were based upon existing studies, sources and official documents which have applied multi-criteria evaluation and extensive in-country stakeholder consultation to arrive at prioritised measures (i.e. INDC, TNC, NAMAs and various sectoral policy documents), a revised bottom-up evaluation of all potential mitigation options was not undertaken. Instead, NDC measures were identified from existing sources within Malawi and subsequently classified as conditional and unconditional by each of the consultant teams drawing upon the technical analysis, existing information and discussions with focal points. These were provided for review and validation by government departments and other stakeholders.</p>
                    <p>Following completion of the technical analysis, covering the BAU development and mitigation analysis, a validation workshop was held with national experts and government representatives alongside a series of regional and local dissemination and stakeholder events. The following key items were highlighted for review, discussion and validation:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Choice of mitigation measures for inclusion in the NDC</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Review and validation of the technical assumptions used to develop the GHG reduction and cost estimates across each key sector (by sector departments and experts)</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Review and validation of the estimated allocation of unconditional and conditional contributions to the identified measures (by sector departments and experts)</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Discussion of choices and approaches to target-setting (types, scope, periods etc)</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
            <h3><a>4.2 Adaptation</a></h3>
      <p>The adaptation component of this NDC is an upgrade from that of the 2015 INDC. While the initial selection of adaptation measures was based on priority sectors for the country as identified in the previous INDC and confirmed in national policies, programmes and plans, this NDC took a further step to refine the measures by reflecting on desired outcomes – an approach advanced by the National Resilience Strategy (2018-2030) that allows for cross- sector collaboration in planning and delivery. A special outcome on strengthened governance has been proposed to support coordinated implementation of the measures, which was found to be a major challenge in the delivery of the previous INDC.</p>
      <p>The NDC comes with an improved Monitoring and Evaluation framework with an elaborated structure for reporting progress nationally and internationally. The framework is aligned with the UN SDGs through linkage to SDG indicators, and to the national vision (Malawi 2063) through linkage with the vision‟s pillar and enabler provisions and indicators. The framework also includes engendered measure-specific indicators capable of tracking the extent of gender and vulnerability integration across sectors.</p>
      <p>The adaptation component of the analysis was developed in close coordination with the Adaptation Expert Working Group (EWG). The prioritised adaptation measures and actions identified from the work were coupled with a proposed set of indicators to measure and evaluate their progress towards targeted outcomes, along with cost estimates. The Adaptation EWG and other national stakeholders were requested to review and validate the set of measures, its proposed M&amp;E framework and the cost estimates, and as far as possible to provide inputs. As a result of this process, changes to choice of indicators were made and taken forward into the subsequent stage of work (NDC Implementation Plan and M&amp;E Framework).</p>
      <h2><a>5 Mitigation contribution</a></h2>
            <h3><a>5.1 Overview</a></h3>
            <p>Malawi's mitigation contribution takes the form of a reduction in GHG emissions relative to a business-as-usual (BAU) emissions baseline over the period to 2040. The contribution comprises of two components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Unconditional contribution</strong>: A reduction of 6 per cent relative to BAU in the year 2040; equivalent to an estimated mitigation level of 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in that year. This is an unconditional target, based on domestically supported and implemented mitigation measures and policies.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Conditional contribution</strong>: An additional reduction of 45 per cent relative to BAU in the year 2040; equivalent to an estimated mitigation level of 15.6 million tCO2e in that year. This represents an additional targeted contribution, based on the provision of international support and funding.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
                <p>The combined unconditional and conditional contribution is therefore a 51 per cent reduction in GHG emissions compared to BAU in 2040, expressed as a single year target; this is equivalent to an estimated mitigation level of up to 17.7 million tCO2e in 2040. The coverage of the contribution includes the three main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).</p>
                <p>The sectoral scope of this contribution covers all emissions sources described in the IPCC 2006 Reporting Guidelines, including emissions from the categories of energy; industrial processes and product use (IPPU); waste; and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) but excluding sources from forestry and other land use. These sources may be included within future contributions, subject to improved data availability and ongoing development in the accuracy of their quantification within the national GHG inventory. For this updated NDC, an indicative emissions reduction contribution has instead been made. This has been estimated at 59.8 million tCO2e of reductions through a range of forestry and land use interventions covering an area of up to 2 million hectares (Ha), of which 22 per cent is unconditional and 78 per cent conditional on international support.</p>
                <p>This section describes Malawi's nationally determined contribution to mitigation. It describes the emissions sources covered by the contribution according to the latest national GHG inventory year, the development of BAU emissions projections by sector to 2040, the expected contribution from mitigation measures according to each sector, and the associated funding requirements expected for both the unconditional and conditional components. The section includes information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) in relation to the development and scope of the target(s), comprising both the BAU scenario and emissions reductions associated with implementation of the mitigation measures.</p>
            <h3><a>5.2 GHG emissions inventory</a></h3>
            <p>Malawi's Third National Communication (TNC) (GoM, 2020) provides a detailed breakdown of the national GHG emissions inventory for the year 2010. However, the TNC also provides emissions estimates up to 2017 based on data developed by the national GHG inventory team in accordance with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines (IPCC, 2016). This year was therefore adopted as the most recent data year for the revised BAU modelling across all emitting sectors. GHG inventory data in the year 2017 is summarised in Figure5-1, and shown in greater detail in Table 5-1 according to IPCC reporting categories for all GHG emissions sources.</p>
            <p>Total emissions excluding FOLU are estimated at 9.33 million tCO2e for 2017. Agriculture accounted for by far the largest share of the total (5.07 million tCO2e, 54% of total), followed by Energy (2.34 million tCO2e, 25% of total) and waste (1.67 million tCO2e, 18% of total). Emissions from IPPU represented just 0.24 milliontCO2e, equivalent to around 3% of total emissions in 2017 (mainly associated with calcination CO2 emissions from minerals production). Emissions from livestock, predominantly methane from enteric fermentation in cattle, represented the largest emissions source category, followed by N2O emissions from managed soils in crop production. Following these agriculture sources, major sources included CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use in transport, which accounted for 11% of the total, and methane emissions from unmanaged waste disposal site (dumps), which accounted for 13% of the total.</p>

            <p>The data show that Malawi has very low per capita emissions - around 0.5 tCO2e - compared to other countries within the region. This figure is around one fifth of the regional average and just thirteenth of the world average, reflecting Malawi's predominantly agricultural economy based on subsistence farming with relatively low fossil fuel consumption. The data also show that Malawi has a relatively low emissions intensity – around 1.5 tCO2e per „000 (thousand) USD GDP – which is also around one fifth of the regional average. Although per capita GDP is relatively low in Malawi at around 360 USD<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, the low intensity value mainly reflects the importance of the relatively non-energy intensive and low emitting agriculture sector to the national economy.</p>

            <h3><a>5.3 Mitigation potential</a></h3>
                    <h4>5.3.1 Methodological approach</h4>
                    <p>Malawi's NDC mitigation targets are based on an in-depth assessment of the country's mitigation potential against a BAU baseline scenario through 2040. This has been undertaken through a process that integrates an analysis of Malawi's existing sectoral and climate policy framework, the generation of qualitative information through consultation with government officials, experts and stakeholders, quantitative modelling of mitigation options and scenarios, and multi-criteria assessment to determine conditional and unconditional contributions.</p>
                    <p>In so doing, the analysis builds on the work undertaken in support of Malawi's INDC submission in 2015 and other more recent studies including e.g. GHG mitigation estimates made in the context of NAMAs and the Third National Communication (TNC) to the UNFCCC (GoM, 2020), and a variety of other official data and information sources. The mitigation analysis was undertaken according to there key steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p><strong>Step 1: Develop BAU emissions forecasts</strong>: Based on the national GHG inventory emissions in key sector categories (Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use, IPPU, Waste, Agriculture, and Forestry and Other Land Use; AFOLU)<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> develop a revised BAU baseline scenario through 2040.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Step 2: Undertake GHG mitigation and economic assessment: Identify and collect information on mitigation options across sectors based on the INDC measures and discussions with in-country officials and experts, and quantify their emissions reduction potential through 2040 compared to the BAU scenario. Quantify economic costs and benefits (including estimated investment requirements) to enable cost- benefits analysis (CBA) and calculation of GHG abatement costs and investment.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Step 3: Model GHG reduction pathways: Model alternative GHG pathways based on the assessed mitigation options against the BAU baseline through 2040 to quantify the emissions reduction potential across NDC sectors and associated costs and investment needs.</p>
                        <p>These steps are described further below.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>5.3.2 Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario</h4>
                    <p>This section summarises the choice and development of a BAU emissions baseline for Malawi. The projection provides the reference case against which the emissions reduction potential from specific mitigation actions has been estimated under alternative GHG reduction pathways (described further below).</p>
                    <p>The BAU modelling approach is based on detailed bottom-up activity and GHG projections developed for each emitting sector through 2040. These reflect a number of assumptions determining changes in <i>inter alia</i> energy supply and demand, agricultural output, waste generation, and technology uptake. In so doing, existing government projections and plans were assessed, and experts consulted within relevant ministries, agencies and organisations. The BAU projections were undertaken by separate consulting teams and separate technical reports have been prepared for these providing details on the projections made.</p>
                    <p>Given the very large degree of uncertainty when accounting for emissions and removals from forestry and other land use (FOLU)<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, as well as challenges in data collection and management, this category has been excluded from the BAU analysis. As part of Malawi's REDD+ activities, a national forestry reference level (FRL) has been prepared but at present this is provisional only and subject to revision. For similar reasons, Malawi's mitigation contribution relating to FOLU is treated separately from other emitting sources which can be more robustly quantified, reflecting international guidance and current practice.</p>
                    <p>It is recognised that the development of a counterfactual baseline projection to 2040 involves an inherently large degree of uncertainty. It is therefore proposed that a <i>dynamic baseline</i> be adopted allowing the BAU emissions to be updated by Malawi over the NDC implementation period, to be communicated within each BTR. The basis upon the dynamic baseline will be updated during the NDC commitment period will include key technical factors such as the availability of revised official national projections for GDP growth and population, any errors being rectified; and updates to reflect continuous improvement in emissions inventories (e.g. apply the latest IPCC guidelines), emissions factors and data sources. It is proposed that fundamental and/or methodological changes are not made within the period to the main target (covering all sources excluding FOLU) and that the FOLU contribution in future NDC periods be refined/adjusted based on additional technical assessments and the finalised national forestry reference level (FRL).<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
                    <p>The bottom-up sectoral projections are aggregated below to produce an economy-wide forecast of BAU emissions through 2040 (Figure 5-3 and Table 5-2). This represents the BAU baseline projection of all emitting sectors, excluding FOLU, against which the contribution from NDC mitigation measures can be quantified. At an aggregate level, total emissions are forecast to increase by more than three times over the 2017-2040 period, rising from 9.3 million tCO2e in 2017 to 34.6 million tCO2e in 2040. The graph shows that this represents a slightly increased rate of growth compared to that seen during the period 2010-2017, closely reflecting the assumptions around economic and population growth, as well as future expansion of grid-based fossil power generation.</p>
                    <p>The most rapid growth is forecast within energy use (energy industries, transport, other energy use and fugitive emission), which expands its share of total emissions from 25% in 2017 to around 42% in 2030 and 57% by 2040. The share of emissions from waste generation (wastewater and solid waste) falls slightly from around 18% in 2017 to 12% in 2040, whilst the share of emissions from agricultural sources (crop management and livestock) declines from 54% to 29% over the same period. Emissions from IPPU remain at around 2% of the total. These trends clearly indicate the growing contribution from fossil fuels to national emissions, arising from increasing demand for thermal power generation and transport services. At the same time, despite potential for increased productivity, agricultural output in expected to be limited, growing broadly in line with trends over the past decade.</p>

                    <h4>Mitigation assessment</h4>
                    <p>A detailed assessment of GHG mitigation measures for Malawi was next undertaken to quantify the contribution within the updated NDC and the associated investment needs. The analysis was undertaken according to a four-step process:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Step 1: Identifying mitigation options: A comprehensive list of potential emission reduction projects and measures was first developed through a thorough review of national documents and discussions and consultation with government officials, sector experts and other stakeholders.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Step 2: Assessing the potential: The identified options were then assessed in terms of their mitigation potential through 2040 compared to the BAU reference scenario, and their socio-economic costs and benefits by undertaking cost-benefit analysis (CBA).</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Step 3: Evaluating the measures: The quantitative analysis was complimented by a broader assessment in order to determine and validate which measures can be implemented through domestic efforts („unconditional‟ measures) and which will instead require international support and finance („conditional‟ measures), including through international market-based approaches e.g. under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Step 4: Alternative GHG emissions pathways: Based on the analysis undertaken, the economy-wide mitigation potential through the period to 2040 was modelled against the BAU baseline. Two basic NDC mitigation scenarios were modelled, covering implementation of (a) all NDC measures; and (b) domestic measures only.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                        <p>Each of these steps is described further below.</p>
                        <h4>Identifying mitigation options</h4>
                        <p>The first step of the assessment involved identifying a range of mitigation options from within the each of the NDC sectors for further consideration and quantitative analysis. A bottom-up long-list was developed through close consultation with various stakeholders and experts, based on the following key sources:</p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Malawi's INDC (GoM, 2015a)</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) for Malawi (GoM, 2015b)</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Sectoral Technical Needs Assessments (TNA) for Climate Change Mitigation</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Malawi's Third National Communication (TNC) to the UNFCCC (GoM, 2020)</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                        <p>Additional mitigation measures were also reviewed, including those identified from the latest sectoral plans, programmes and projects (e.g. national forestry strategies, electricity generation system planning, transport planning, municipal waste drainage and sanitation master plans). Information was collected primarily through discussions with the agreed focal points within the relevant ministries, departments and other organisations.</p>
                        <p>The resulting long-list was refined on these discussions and follow-up meetings with government officials and sector experts through August 2020 to February 2021. As part of this process, the measures identified in the INDC were re-assessed along with additional projects and programmes. In some cases, the details, and context, regarding some of the projects were found to have changed since the time of INDC submission in 2015. The long- list thereby reflects a set of real projects and programmes under consideration, or which have been studied by government officials, sector experts and donor partners. As such, it draws upon a rich source of national information gathering, and in-country and international expertise. A total of 33 separate measures were identified for quantitative mitigation assessment.</p>
                        <h4>Assessing the potential</h4>
                        <p>Figure 5-5 summarises the estimated annual emissions reduction potential in 2040 for the mitigation measures modelled. The pie charts indicate the relative contribution made from projects within the key sectors of Energy (covering electricity and heat generation, manufacturing, transport, other energy use and fugitive emissions), Waste, IPPU and Agriculture against the base case BAU projected emissions described above. The estimated potential from the forestry sector (FOLU) is presented separately from these emitting source sectors further below. Descriptions of each of the measures are given in the summary Implementation Plan presented further below.</p>
                        <p>The total mitigation potential is estimated at around 17.7 million tCO2e in 2040 compared to base case BAU emissions in the same year of 34.6 million tCO2e. According to the analysis, mitigation measures identified within the energy sector accounts for by far the largest share of total potential at 85%, followed by agriculture (9% of total), waste (5%), and IPPU (1%).</p>
                        <p>Within <strong>energy</strong> use, increased use of renewables and clean coal technology to meet increasing energy demand combined dominate the mitigation potential. Significant emissions reduction potential exists across each of the key sub-sectors. The application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to future grid-based thermal power plants from 2030 onwards represents the largest share of the identified GHG reduction potential, with almost half of all sectoral mitigation by 2040. This is followed by large-scale grid hydropower with over a quarter of the total potential. Other measures within electricity and heat generation including the use of high efficiency ultra-super critical coal-fired, large-scale grid based solar PV and efficient charcoal production contribute around 18% of the total. Emissions reductions arising from modal shift and low carbon fuels in the transport sector are also considered to be potentially significant, together contributing around 10% of the estimated energy sector mitigation potential by 2040.</p>
                        <p>Within <strong>agriculture</strong>, soil conservation measures – which include conservation or zero tillage and crop residue and rotation practices – account for almost half of the sector‟s feasible mitigation potential. The bulk of the remaining mitigation potential includes measures to reduce enteric fermentation emissions from livestock, including improved livestock husbandry and the potential introduction of new species to replace local herds.</p>
                        <p>Within <strong>waste</strong>, the most significant potential is identified within energy utilisation measures such as landfill gas recovery and to a lesser extent direct waste-to-energy (WtE) plants. Mitigation potential from <strong>IPPU</strong> sources is by comparison relatively limited, with the majority of emissions reductions arising from increased use of rice husk ash (RHA) blending and earth stabilised blocks (ESB) to reduce clinker and cement demand; over the longer term, the use of emerging low carbon clinker processes may also be feasible.</p>

                        <p>Within <strong>forestry and other land use (FOLU)</strong>, the most significant drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Malawi are the expansion of agriculture and settlements, and unsustainable fuelwood extraction. Under its REDD+ program, Malawi is seeking to maximize potential emission reductions by implementing targeted measures and activities that will lower net emissions by lowering rates of deforestation, lowering rates of forest degradation from unsustainable fuelwood harvesting, and enhancing carbon stocks through afforestation and reforestation. Four key areas of intervention were identified for quantitative assessment and inclusion within the NDC:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <p>Afforestation (protective forests, woodlots and urban forests)</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>Agroforestry (wood, fruit and fodder)</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>Sustainable forest management (including REDD+)</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>Riparian restoration</p>
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These measures are closely aligned with a number of national policies including the National Forest Policy, Malawi's REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Strategy, the National Forest Landscape Restoration Strategy (NFLRS), and the National Charcoal Strategy and National Climate Change Investment Plan.</p>
                        <p>In total, the identified measures represent a very significant implementation of additional forestry activities on over one half of a million hectares (534,478 ha) of national land over the coming decade. If scaled up with international support, it is estimated that this could be increased to just under 2 million ha, in line with estimated scaled-up potential to 2030 as outlined in the NFLRS.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The associated net emissions removals calculated from the FOLU sector through 2040 are shown below. The net emissions reduction potential from afforestation and sustainable forestry management, which includes REDD+, can be seen to be particularly significant; taken together the measures are estimated to offer around 40 million tCO2e of net removals through the NDC period, or two thirds of the total estimated potential of 59.8 million tCO2e.</p>

                        <h4>Evaluating the measures</h4>
                        <p>Economic analysis indicates that many of the identified projects will require significant financial support. Developing country Parties to the UNFCCC are asked to identify the "means of implementation" relating to their NDC mitigation measures, including the scale of international support required. In this context, Malawi has developed its NDC contribution according to two different components:</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Unconditional contribution: Those mitigation measures and policies which will be implemented „unconditionally‟ through domestic efforts alone (e.g. funded within committed national policy plans and actions); and</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Conditional contribution: Additional mitigation measures which could be implemented, but only conditional upon the availability of international support (including funding and other types of support from donors, climate finance and potentially carbon markets).</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </ol>
            </ol>
            <p>This approach requires classifying each of the mitigation measures (or a share of its full implementation potential) as either an „unconditional‟ or „conditional‟ action. Multi-criteria evaluation provided a basis for grouping the mitigation measures accordingly. In so doing, the following broad considerations were also used to help guide the choices:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Costs and investment levels: Higher cost projects and those requiring significant up-front investment levels are typically considered more suitable to international support given national budget and resource constraints.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Inclusion within existing national policies and sector plans: Several projects and measures are already included within Malawi's domestic climate policy response and budgeted for within sector plans: these are therefore be viewed as domestically committed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Suitability to international support: Measures are more or less suited to existing and emerging forms of support (e.g. under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement), both in terms of project types and their likelihood to demonstrate real and measurable, and additional, mitigation outcomes.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Based on consultations with experts and staff within government departments, an estimated partition of conditional and unconditional support was developed for each of the identified NDC measures (Table 5-3).</p>

            <h4>Alternative GHG emissions pathways</h4>
            <p>Figure 5-8 illustrates the emission projections for the BAU baseline and two alternative NDC mitigation scenarios covering implementation of (a) all NDC measures; and (b) domestic measures only. The associated values are shown in Table</a> 5-4.</p>
            <p>The graph shows emissions excluding FOLU forecast to grow significantly under the BAU projection from 9.3 MtCO2e in 2017 to 34.6 MtCO2e in 2040. According to the alternative GHG pathway which implements the domestically supported <strong>unconditional</strong> mitigation contribution, it is estimated that by 2040 emissions would instead rise to around 32.6 MtCO2e, representing a reduction against BAU of around 6%. The second mitigation scenario, showing the total mitigation potential from both domestic and <strong>conditional</strong> mitigation, sees emissions increasing by a much reduced rate over the period, to around</p>
            <p>16.9 MtCO2e, equal to a reduction of around 51% by 2040 against the same baseline.</p>

            <p>The BAU and NDC mitigation scenarios are summarised in Figure 5-9 below, which also shows the contribution of each emitting sector to the total estimated potential based on the technical assessments of all mitigation measures.</p>

            <p>A particular feature of the forestry and land use (FOLU) sector is data uncertainty and the large variability for carbon (C) stocks and C stock changes when certain carbon pools are measured. Average uncertainty ranges that are associated with estimates of the level of emissions and removals from the sector are relatively high (32 per cent) compared to other sources such as fossil fuel combustion (1 per cent).<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Furthermore, net emissions and removals from FOLU can show very significant variations over a given period. For these reasons, a separate target for Malawi's FOLU sector has been proposed within the NDC. For this updated NDC, this is presented as a provisional contribution subject to further analysis and finalisation of the national FRL.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
            <p>Reflecting key sector policies such as the National Forest Landscape Restoration Strategy (NFLRS), National Forest Policy and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Strategy, the indicative FOLU contribution is defined in terms of land use (hectares, Ha) for each identified measure but with estimated net GHG emissions reductions also provided for additional clarity and transparency. Given uncertainty levels and annual variations associated with carbon stocks and removals, the estimated GHG reductions are presented as a GHG volume (tCO2e) through the NDC period rather than for a single end target year. These are shown as conditional and unconditional target values as summarised below in Figure 5-10. At present, Malawi's FRL is provisional only and so the estimated net emissions reductions measures arising from additional FOLU interventions through 2040 are not quantified in relation to the FRL.</p>

            <h3><a>5.5 Funding requirements</a></h3>
      <p>The figure below show the estimated funding requirements associated with all identified mitigation options, estimated at 41.8 billion USD through 2040.</p>
      <p>These represent the investment costs required for new plant, installations, equipment and goods, as well as additional implementation and ongoing costs. The funding levels for each sector broadly correspond to the estimated mitigation shares across each emitting sector, with energy projects accounting for the majority (around 86%), followed by agriculture (9%). In order to achieve the projected mitigation outcomes, the estimates indicate how resource requirements increase significantly over each subsequent five-year period. This reflects increasingly deep cuts in emissions through 2040, but also the timing of large capital- intensive energy and infrastructure projects developed from around 2030 onwards.</p>

      <h2><a>6 Adaptation contribution</a></h2>
            <h3><a>6.1 Overview</a></h3>
            <p>This section describes the adaptation component of Malawi's nationally determined contribution. After a description of vulnerability and resilience to climate change impacts, a description is made of the methodology used to prioritise adaptation priorities and develop relevant indicators. Adaptation actions are then described, followed by a summary of the national Implementation Plan for prioritised measures and their estimated funding requirements.</p>
            <h3><a>6.2 Vulnerability and resilience</a></h3>
            <p>As noted earlier, most of the vulnerabilities of the key socio-economic sectors and the supporting ecosystems and natural resources are related to climate extreme events, as heavy rains and droughts and strong winds related to cyclones. Recently, Malawi has been having its heavy share of all, but those effects have been increasingly observed in the last decades.</p>
            <p>The vulnerability assessment was taken from the Third National Communication (TNC) (GoM, 2020). The following conclusions may be drawn from climate change scenario analysis results about future expected temperature and rainfall regimes in Malawi based on the two scenarios used: (a) there is a positive trend in temperature rise, i.e., there will be an increase in temperature in Malawi with climate change; (b) minimum temperatures exhibit a faster rise in temperature with climate change than maximum temperatures; (c) generally, there is an insignificant decrease in rainfall during the October-December period, and an increase during January-March; (d) future temperatures will rise by 1.3 oC to 2.6 oC; and (e) El Niño conditions will likely increase climate extremes, resulting in the increased severity, or magnitude/intensity, and frequency of floods, droughts, and strong winds.</p>
            <p>What is clear from the description of climate change scenarios for Malawi in its TNC is that floods, droughts and strong winds will continue to wreak havoc in the country. The country's vulnerability to the vagaries of severe floods, droughts, and strong winds should therefore be taken as a serious cause for worry by the Government of Malawi and the citizenry, and hence the urgent need by the country to implement robust climate change adaptation strategies in order to avert impending disasters associated with these three hazards.</p>
            <p>It was proposed that the adaptation actions take on the four building blocks of the NAP process, namely: (i) national development strategies, (ii) capacity development, (iii) knowledge and information management, and (iv) sustainable partnerships. The socio- economic sectors are based on the NAP and the TNC and include:</p>

            </ul>
                <p>The sectoral vulnerability assessment is largely based on the TNC. The language used in that from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/">IPCC AR5 Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability Part B: Regional Aspects. 3: Africa (see Figure 6-1)</a>. This refers to climatic drivers, key risks and adaptation issues and prospects or adaptation actions disaggregated in measures, for the specific Malawian case. Key risks are identified based on detailed assessment of the literature including an evaluation based on the assessment of impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability in the Working Group II contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (WGII AR5).</p>
                <p><a>Figure 6-1 Key risks from climate change and the potential for risk reduction through mitigation and adaptation in Africa.</p>
                <p><img width="602" height="856" alt="image" src="img/MWI-NDC1-50.png"></p>
                <p>Each key risk is characterized as very low, low, medium, high, or very high. Risk levels are presented for the near-term era of committed climate change (here, for 2030–2040), in which projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across emissions scenarios. Risk levels are also presented for the longer-term era of climate options (here, for 2080–2100), for global mean temperature increase of 2°C and 4°C above pre-industrial levels. For each time frame, risk levels are estimated for the current state of adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state. As the assessment considers potential impacts on different physical, biological, and human systems, risk levels should not necessarily be used to evaluate relative risk across key risks. Relevant climate variables are indicated by symbols.</p>

            <h3><a>6.3 Methodological approach</a></h3>
            <p>The adaptation work stream was undertaken in close alignment with work already done in Malawi to increase the climate resilience of the most vulnerable communities and ecosystems. The adaptation assessment was undertaken according to four steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Step 1: Review all relevant documents and sources to develop long-list of adaptation measures</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Step 2: Assess and prioritise identified measures</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Step 3: Develop adaptation indicators for each measure, and targets to inform updated NDC and</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Step 4: Assess funding needs, mitigation co-benefits and contribution towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
                <p>The analysis involved extensive review of all relevant studies, programmes and documents relating to vulnerability, resilience and climate adaptation in Malawi. These included the INDC, the NAP, the Third National Communication, the NAPA, the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA), the National Climate Change Investment Plan (NCCIP) and the National Response Strategy (NRS). In reviewing such documents, the first step of the analysis covered the identification of the adaptation actions and measures that could be included within the revised NDC.</p>
                <p>In reviewing these documents, the first step of the analysis covered the identification of the adaptation actions and measures that could now be included within the updated NDC. The literature review led to the identification of more than 300 (three hundred) adaptation measures that were initially computed in an excel file with the identification of the sector, the action, the measure, a brief description, the expected resilience effect, and the source of the information. The measures and actions were grouped according to the following sectors:</p>

                <p>These were later grouped according to the following thematic areas:</p>

                </ol>
                <p>The indication of the conditionality of the measure (according to the level of unconditional or conditional support) was also included where such information was available.</p>
                <p>After sharing the long-list with the members of the Malawi Adaptation Expert Working Group (EWG), a series of workshops was undertaken in order to undertaken prioritization of the interventions based on a use of multi-criteria analysis. These included representatives covering the various sectors, including environment affairs, irrigation, agriculture, economic planning and development and civil society. Based on the outcomes of the workshops, it was decided to cluster and prioritize the measures and then to share this with the EWG and other sector experts, and to engage on one-on-one consultations to validate the short list, and where possible obtain information on indicators, targets and cost estimates.</p>
            <h3>6.4 Resilience and assessment of adaptation responses</h3>
            <p>Table 6-2 shows the main adaptation actions by objective and pillar of the adaptation stream of the NDC. The ten strategic options are related to the three pillars – (i) institutional framework, (ii) knowledge, technology and financing and (iii) resilience of the most vulnerable, which support three main objectives – (i) promote an enabling environment to facilitate climate change adaptation (CCA) mainstreaming, (ii) improve capacity for data and information management and sharing, and access to technology and financing for adaptation, and (iii) plan and implement adaptation actions toward an increased resilience of the most vulnerable Malawians.</p>

            <h3><a>6.7 Funding requirements</a></h3>
      <p>According to the NAP framework, every year Malawi loses an average of 1.7% of its GDP as a result of climate change-related disasters, mainly floods and drought. An economic vulnerability and disaster risk assessment conducted by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) indicates that annual flood damage in the Shire River Basin (the country's most flood-prone area) results in an average loss of 0.7% of GDP per year, while elsewhere in the country drought causes an average economic loss of 1% of GDP annually. In short, climate change is making Malawi's pathway to prosperity more difficult, more complex and costlier. Factors that increase vulnerability to climate change impacts in Malawi are deep-rooted: poverty, rapid population growth that results in overexploitation of natural resources, and high dependence on subsistence rain-fed agriculture. Finding a way to simultaneously finance the promotion of climate proofed development and recovery after the pandemics is therefore key to recovery.</p>
      <p>Cost estimates for the prioritised adaptation measures were made for different time periods through 2040. Estimates were made by referring to different planning documents, through discussions with members of the Adaptation Expert Working Group (EWG) and other experts, and through assessing and scaling based on the costs of similar projects. As with the mitigation contribution, some programmes and interventions will be conditional on the availability of external financial support (“conditional”) while others are expected to be implemented through domestic funding (“unconditional”) or co-financing (internal and external sources of budget).</p>
      <p>As shown below, the total implementation of all prioritised adaptation measures is estimated at around 4.5 billion USD through 2040. Through consultation with sector experts, and considering existing government initiatives and planned programmes, the total funding requirements for the adaptation contribution are estimated at around 53% conditional on international support and 47% unconditional. The estimates also show how the bulk of the support is required over the coming decade, reflecting the need to mobilise adaptation funding in order to prepare and manage climate impacts and risks expected to increase in Malawi over the near term.</p>

      <h2><a>7 Monitoring, reporting and verification framework</a></h2>
            <h3><a>7.1 Tracking the NDC target</a></h3>
            <p>All Parties to the UNFCCC are required to implement a domestic monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system that can annually quantify national GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks, and report the specific actions made to identify and implemented mitigation measures. This information is at present compiled by Malawi and is submitted to the UNFCCC through two channels:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>National Communications (NCs) to be submitted every four years, covering measurements of GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks compiled in accordance with IPCC reporting guidelines (i.e. a National GHG inventory). These should also include a description of steps made to implement mitigation actions in support of the UNFCCC goal, among other aspects (as required under Decision 17/CP.8 and other decisions on implementation details); and</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to be submitted every two years. These should include an updated GHG inventory report from that of the NC, a measurement of mitigation actions and their impacts, reporting on the domestic MRV system and a description of needs and international support received. All non-Annex I countries were requested to submit their first BUR by December 2014 and then every two years thereafter (Decision 2/CP.17; Decision 19/CP.18; Decision 9/CP.21).</p>
              </li>

                <p>The Paris Agreement requires accounting for anthropogenic emissions and removals corresponding to the NDC, in accordance with common methodologies and measurement systems evaluated by the IPCC and approved by the CMP (1/CP.21, Paragraph 31). The methodologies evaluated by the IPCC are those used for estimating the National GHG Inventory estimation. The NDC target will be tracked based on the annual emissions estimated in the National GHG Inventory and the projected BAU scenario emissions within the NDC period, as follows:</p>
                <p><img width="367" height="83" alt="image" src="img/MWI-NDC1-82.png"></p>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <p>BAU (t) Emissions (and removals) in baseline in tCO2e at time <i>t</i></p>
                <p>Inventory (t) Emissions (and removals) in GHG Inventory in tCO2e at time <i>t</i></p>
                <p>The Paris Agreement contains several additional MRV requirements which, when taken together with the existing UNFCCC arrangements, provide an enhanced basis for Malawi's international reporting requirements relating to its updated NDC. The enhanced transparency framework (ETF) established by the Paris Agreement requires an MRV system to transparently report progress made towards the targets defined in Malawi's NDC and to track the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as the use and results of means of including climate finance. The system should also capture broader non-GHG impacts – such as environmental, social and economic impacts – resulting from implementation of measures for the purposes of evaluating their contribution to achieving broader development goals.</p>
                <p>A framework of indicators consistent with the international requirements has been developed. This will allow Malawi to effectively track progress of the mitigation activities identified in this NDC consistent with UNFCCC reporting standards, and carry out ongoing evaluation of whether the country is on course to meet its targets through 2040.</p>
            <h3><a>7.2 Institutional arrangements</a></h3>
            <p>At the national level, the Malawi Government has put in place robust national planning process involving pillar, enabler, sector and district level coordination structures that are coordinated by the National Planning Commission (NPC) for medium to long term plans and strategies, and the Ministry of Economic Planning, Development and Public Sector Reforms (MOEPD&amp;PSR) through sector working groups (SWGs) that track the short term implementation of sector priorities aligned with the goals of the Malawi Growth Development Strategy (MGDS) III and the National Vision (Malawi 2063).</p>
            <p>The top-most structures shall be the Pillar Coordination Groups (PCGs) that link directly and will be responsible for spearheading implementation and reporting progress on the three pillars of the National Vision: Agriculture, Productivity and Commercialization; Industrialization; and Urbanization. The PCGs shall be supported by the Enabler Coordination Group on Environmental Sustainability (ECGES). Co-chaired by MEPD&amp;PSR and MOFNR, with EAD as the secretariat, the ECGES will bring together all relevant stakeholders (state and non-state) falling under the Environmental Sustainability enabler. Given the cross-cutting nature of environmental sustainability matters, the ECGES will report to each of the three Pillar Coordination Groups (PCGs) on matters relevant to the pillar. The PCGs and ECGES will work closely with the existing National Steering Committee on Climate Change (NSCCC) and the joint Technical Committee on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management (TCCC&amp;DRM) in defining multi-year pillar and enabler priorities as well as advising Government on the resources required for meeting the defined Vision priorities within their respective pillars and/or enablers. The NSCCC and TCCC&amp;DRM shall receive policy and implementation oversight from the NPC through the ECGES.</p>
            <p>The NSCCC comprises all key ministries and departments and provides strategic direction and inter-ministerial coordination on national climate change policy including Malawi's NDC. The NSCCC is chaired by the MOEPD&amp;PSR, with MOFNR acting as the main implementing partner. It is supported by the joint Technical Committee on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management (TCCC&amp;DRM) which provides technical guidance on all climate change, disaster risk management and resilience issues in Malawi. The TCCC&amp;DRM reports to the NSCCC and includes representatives from various government entities as well as civil society, donor parties and private sector. The committee is co-chaired by the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services (DCCMS) and the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DODMA). A number of Expert Working Groups (EWGs) provide specialised technical guidance and report to the TCCC&amp;DRM. The working groups are established according to requirement and include Adaptation, Mitigation and Climate Finance.</p>
            <p>Within this framework, the Environmental Affairs Department (EAD) of the Ministry of Forestry and Natural Resources (MOFNR) formulates and oversees climate policy development in Malawi including the day-to-day coordination of the NDC development process. EAD is the UNFCCC focal point and serves as the secretariat of both the NSCCC and TCCC&amp;DRM. The EAD has the overall responsibility for, and chairs, the thematic EWGs and also has overall responsibility for preparing and maintaining the national GHG inventory and submitting Malawi's National Communications, BURs, BTRs and NDCs to the UNFCCC.</p>
            <p>The TCCC&amp;DRM forum, led by the EAD, is the ideal platform for guiding the analytical framework for reporting, updating and implementing the national mitigation and adaptation priorities under the NDC. The TCCC&amp;DRM acting through the Adaption EWG and Mitigation EWG will serve as the national coordinator for all national institutions that implement sector specific mitigation and adaptation measures, receive finance and other means of support, and oversee tracking and reporting of the NDC at the national level.</p>
            <p>Figure 7-1 below summarises these institutional arrangements for tracking of NDC implementation including the national NDC MRV process.</p>

                    <h4>7.2.1 Role of TCCC&amp;DRM in coordinating NDC MRV</h4>
                    <p>Additional to its normal functions, the joint TCCC&amp;DRM shall perform the following functions through the Adaptation and Mitigation EWGs. Where the NDC MRV roles fall beyond the expertise available within the TCCC&amp;DRM, the committee shall co-opt such expertise, as necessary.</p>
                    <p>The EAD, leading the committee and overseeing the EWGs, will guide the selection of members to provide technical oversight and present the MRV of the NDC annually to the TCCC&amp;DRM for official endorsement. Following the endorsement, EAD will communicate the NDC MRV through the normal national reporting channels including the NSCCCC to inform policy and strategic decisions that ensure NDC MRV effectively supports national sustainable development and is in alignment with the MGDS III and National Vision. The following are key aspects that form part of the mandate of the technical group:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Review and establish objectives for the group, membership and overall working modalities, principal of which is the endorsement and subsequent reporting of the NDC MRV at both national and international levels;</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Provide advice and feedback on scope, schedule, cost and quality concerns, or guidance on program priorities, that arise during the planning, design and implementation of the NDC;</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Facilitate access to resources necessary to review and report on NDC MRV and approve projects at key milestones;</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Review and examine studies and research activities in line with NDCs to facilitate quality assurance and alignment with strategic priorities (including sectoral plans, MGDS III, and Malawi Vision 2063)</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Develop and operationalize an effective NDC MRV communications plan</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                        <p>These roles build upon the Malawi Climate Transparency Framework, developed as part of Malawi's involvement in the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT).<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> NDC information can be shared within the CBIT Global Coordination Platform and other relevant platforms and network.</p>
                    <h4>7.2.2 NDC MRV data and information management system</h4>
            <p>An integrated MRV data and information management system, drawing upon existing procedures and resources, is required as part of a robust M&amp;E framework for NDC implementation. All climate change relevant data including NDC MRV managed and reported by the TCCC&amp;DRM will be processed and accessed through the development of such a system. Assessing and defining the most suitable data sources is important for any MRV system to be effective. The Adaptation and Mitigation EWGs will play a critical role of the national level data and information generation and reporting and will be significantly involved in data gathering, transparency, and verification. The TCCC&amp;DRM will ensure that Malawi's NDC MRV system links mitigation, adaptation and finance as well as support for capacity building and technology transfer as critical aspects of NDC implementation.</p>
            <p>Primary data collected at the local level will draw upon those sectors and institutions with direct linkages to local levels (Districts) in sourcing relevant action specific data and information. This will be done with support of broad District based stakeholders through the District Executive Committee (DEC), providing an opportunity for engagement of NGOs private sector and development partners to provide inputs into the NDC MRV process. MOLG provides coordination oversight in facilitating local government data management flows to central level institutions.</p>
            <p>The NDC MRV system shall be hosted by the Department of Economic Planning and Development (EPD) and integrated within the existing national management information system (MIS). This exists as a robust established platform for reporting on environmental factors, which will be enhanced to report on NDC progress as per an agreed framework of key indicators. As the Co-Chairs of the NSCCC, MOEPD&amp;PSR and EAD will have joint responsibility to provide the overall strategic direction on the MRV and M&amp;E of the NDC. The TCCC&amp;DRM has responsibility for coordinating the NDC MRV, including ensuring engagement of all relevant institutions and stakeholders to provide the data required for inputting to the MIS. Given the timeframe of the NDC implementation plan, an agreement will be reached on the key indicators for integration in the National Planning Commission (NPC) medium to long term reporting system.</p>
            <p>The National Statistical Office (NSO) is central to national data processes and has the role of validating national statistics through data and information authentication and therefore approval for national statistics shared externally. The NSO will facilitate development and application of data protocols and annually review national level standards and guidelines for data inputs and aggregation to guide sector and/or agency generated data and information on mitigation and adaptation. MOEDP&amp;PSR is the ideal national institution for tracking NDC MRV related finance. The National Climate Change Fund acting as the national fund for environment and climate change will liaise with MOEDP&amp;PSR to manage data on finance and provide a platform to access finance data and information for national reporting. This information will be critical to guide resource mobilization for the successful implementation of Malawi's NDC.</p>
            <p>The NDC MRV information will be prepared using appropriate reporting protocols and formats for national level as well as international reporting. At the national level, NDC MRV will be monitored, analysed and reported annually to the NSCCC and the Natural Resources SWG (uploaded on an IT-based system) using national planning driven process coordinated by MOEDP&amp;PSR to inform policy and strategic planning. The EAD has good experience in reporting to the UNFCCC through National communications (NC) and Biennial Update Reports (BURs). The TCCC&amp;DRM led by EAD will therefore build on this experience to</p>
            <p>coordinate national agencies responsible for data generation and management of NDC MRV reporting to UNFCCC. NDC information and indicators can also be provided as part of Malawi's involvement in the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT).</p>
            <p>The table below summarises Malawi's framework for tracking and reporting on progress of implementing the mitigation and adaptation goals outlined in the NDC. It indicates the institutions, fora, roles and responsibilities proposed to guide and support implementation of MRV of the NDC at the national level including policy and strategic decision levels. Supporting information on the mitigation and adaptation components are provided further below.</p>

      <h2><a>8 Means of implementation</a></h2>
  <p>According to Article 13 of the Paris Agreement and its associated decisions, developed countries reiterated their previous commitment to channel at least USD 100 billion in annual climate finance to developing countries by 2020. They also agreed to establish a more ambitious climate finance target from 2025. Developing countries are requested to report on the support they have received and any additional needs they have in these areas. For adaptation financing, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) has committed to allocate at least half of its resources to adaptation, and half of its adaptation resources to Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is also a particular drive by many bilateral donors to scale up their support for adaptation.</p>
  <p>To fully implement the mitigation and adaptation contributions described in this document, Malawi will require support in the form of finance, capacity building, and technology transfer. This section provides an overview of these means of implementation.</p>
        <h3><a>8.1 Finance needs</a></h3>
        <p>The NDC updating process has made use of extensive consultations with sector experts to generate “conditional” and “unconditional” costing estimates for both mitigation and adaptation measures projected through to 2025, 2030 and 2040.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> These estimates, provided by consultant teams led by the EC, UNDP and Carbon Counts, will guide and position Malawi for strategic resources mobilization to meet its climate action ambition, and help inform a process of tracking climate finance flows towards climate mitigation and adaptation action.</p>
        <p>The total estimated cost for Malawi's identified NDC mitigation measures through 2040 is estimated at around 41.8 billion USD for mitigation measures, and around 4.5 billion USD for adaptation measures, representing a combined funding requirement of 46.3 billion USD. Of this total, around one third is estimated to be required over the next decade (2020-2030), and two thirds in the subsequent decade (2030-2040). For both mitigation and adaptation combined, it can be seen that unconditional measures account for around 24% of the total estimated funding requirements, and conditional measures around 76%.</p>

        <p>Challenges for climate finance in Malawi include insufficient funds, a limited domestic budget for the implementation of climate actions, and the limited involvement of private sector investment in environment and climate change activities. In response to these factors, Malawi is currently preparing a resource mobilization strategy which will identify sources of finance and strategies to fund and support the prioritised measures identified in this document.</p>
        <p>As reflected in the unconditional contribution described in this document, the Government of Malawi will continue to commit significant resources to climate change relevant strategies, both in relation to mitigation and adaptation. Malawian communities, private sector and NGOs can also contribute significantly to these climate change-related activities through public-private partnerships. In this context, the National Climate Change Fund (NCCF) is expected to play a vital role in financing low carbon projects and programmes and leveraging investment.</p>
        <p>Given the estimated funding requirements outlined above there is clearly also a need for increased levels of bilateral and multilateral financial support and the full implementation of the identified strategic mitigation actions is conditional on the support of international stakeholders. The implementation of the prioritised policies and actions assume the continued use of existing and planned national and international financial sources. An initial assessment of the funding requirements for the identified measures has been described in this document, and implementation costs will be further refined as more evidence-based information is obtained, particularly in relation to forestry and other land use (FOLU) measures.</p>
        <p>Malawi intends to meet its conditional contribution through the use of climate finance and international market mechanisms where appropriate, building upon its experience of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and other existing market mechanisms. These include the potential involvement in international cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Malawi is also participating in the NDC Partnership, a process that has so far attracted financing for readiness support on developing a pipeline of projects targeting public and private climate finance. The support packages have come most recently through the Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) which is currently implementing projects in relation to project identification (e.g. concept notes), monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) and NDC implementation planning among other initiatives.</p>
        <h3><a>8.2 Capacity building and technology transfer</a></h3>
        <p>Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries have also committed to provide technology transfer and capacity building to developing countries. Many developing countries will require enhanced capacities to effectively track inflows of bilateral and multilateral resources and support and identify particular gaps and needs.</p>
        <p>Technology transfer and capacity building will be required to fully implement Malawi's mitigation and adaptation contributions. Specific national needs relating to <strong>mitigation</strong> include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Building and enhancing climate information systems, including through the National GHG Inventory;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Gaining access to and overcoming barriers to the application of appropriate clean technologies;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Promotion of renewable energies and energy efficiency, including through the involvement of the private sector;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Setting up of public-private partnerships; and</p>

          <li>
            <p>Improving public awareness, training and skills at national, regional and local levels</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
            <p>In this context, the Government of Malawi plans to:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Support and encourage the development, transfer and uptake of low carbon and climate technology;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Provide adequate support for policies and programmes that take into account the interactions between the needs of communities, climate change and development, including the link between the national, regional and local levels of decision-making</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Promote and enhance climate change education, public awareness and capacity building through ongoing communication, training, information and knowledge management; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Actively integrate the mainstreaming of gender considerations within climate change measures and where relevant to track climate change issues and indicators according to gender and vulnerable groups;</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
            <p>In relation to <strong>adaptation</strong>, specific capacity and national needs include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Improved capability (human resources and technology) to deliver sector specific weather services for averting disaster (including flood, drought and pest infestation) through effective early warning systems and disaster management;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Access to, and overcoming barriers to the adoption of, climate smart technologies in agriculture, fisheries and water management;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Up-scaled adoption of alternative energy to biomass for cooking and heating;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Climate change adaptation measures that are planned with a gender lens and are capable of targeting and tracking progress and outcomes by gender and other sources of vulnerability;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Humans that realize and exploit ecological goods and services in ways that are mutually beneficial to the social and ecological systems;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Improved and sustained flows through robust water use management/licensing systems and abstraction measurement and regulation technology, and associated water use management tools (procedures and protocols); and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Readily available resources for disaster risk reduction and management.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
            <p>In this context, the Government of Malawi plans to:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Develop a nation-wide community-based early warning system for multiple hazards including floods and drought, and multi-hazard contingency plans;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Expand information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and human capacity to generate and transform climate data into sector-specific information and knowledge products;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Upscale climate smart agriculture;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Implement a national landscape restoration programme that combines promotion of alternative energy sources and afforestation;</p>
          </li>

  <p>Malawi recently completed the first step of the TNA process. The TNA Reports provide a shop list of technologies and their attributes described in the related Technology Fact Sheets (TFS) appended to the TNA reports. Currently, the country is in the second step of TNA process of identifying barriers for the prioritized climate technologies. Once the technology barriers have been identified and analysed, and enabling framework developed, Technology Action Plans (TAPs) will be developed to guide the implementation and transfer of such technologies (GoM, 2020).</p>
