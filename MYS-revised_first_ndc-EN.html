  <h1>Malaysia's NDC</h1>
<p>Malaysia NDC Updated Submission to UNFCCC July 2021 final</p>
<p>MALAYSIA&rsquo;S UPDATE OF ITS FIRST NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION</p>
<p>In accordance with paragraph 2(b) of decision 1/CP.19, Malaysia submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat on 27th November 2015. The submitted INDC was registered as Malaysia&rsquo;s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), following Malaysia&rsquo;s ratification of the Paris Agreement on 16th November 2016. Malaysia hereby communicates its updated NDC in accordance with paragraph 24 of decision 1/CP.21 to contribute to the implementation and achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Malaysia intends to reduce its economy-wide carbon intensity<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (against GDP) of 45% in 2030 compared to 2005 level. The updated NDC includes the following increased ambition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 45% of carbon intensity reduction is unconditional;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This target is an increase of 10% from the earlier submission; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GHG coverage is expanded to seven (7) greenhouse gasses (GHG): Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbon (PFCs), Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Malaysia&rsquo;s accounting approach will strive for transparency, accuracy, consistency, comparability, and completeness (TACCC), and promotes environmental integrity. Continuous improvement will be undertaken to achieve these requirements.</p>
<p>The information for clarity, transparency, and understanding are outlined below and the accompanying information on adaptation is outlined in Annex 1 to this submission.</p>

<p>ANNEX I ACCOMPANYING INFORMATION ON MALAYSIA&rsquo;S ADAPTATION STRATEGIES</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The implementation of climate change adaptation in Malaysia focuses on the management of water resources and security, coastal resources, agriculture and food supply, urban and infrastructure resilience, public health, forestry and biodiversity and key adaptation cross sectoral areas. Based on the downscaled IPCC AR5 scenarios, projections of the future changes indicate that the rise of the average annual surface temperature will range from 1.9 to 2.1&deg;C by the end of the century. The magnitude of change of average annual precipitation is expected to range from 14% to 25%, while the sea levels are projected to continue rising about 0.73 meter by the end of the 21st century.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), RM7.24 billion was allocated for implementation to enhance climate-resilience and adaptation measures, and continuous support will be emphasised in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (2021-2025). Malaysia is also developing the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to ensure that climate change adaptation is mainstreamed into its development plan.</p>
<h3>Management of Water Resources and Security</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>The climate change phenomenon poses challenges to Malaysia&rsquo;s water resources management and security. In this regard the Ministry of Environment and Water is responsible to ensure the sustainability of water resource management in Malaysia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Integrated Water Resources Management is strengthened with the implementation of the Integrated River Basin Management and Integrated Flood Management to ensure efficient water management. Emphasis will be given through gazettement of more forest water catchments to secure adequate and safe water supply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimizing flood impacts by incorporating climate change factors into flood risk assessment and protection projects are important for Malaysia. In this regard, weather-flood forecasting and early warning system based on future climate conditions will be improved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia continues to ensure water security against the impact of prolonged dry spell by increasing water supply reserve margin with the reduction of non-revenue water and implementation of the off-river storage structural forms. Malaysia plans to increase diversification and exploration of alternative water sources such as urban scale rainwater harvesting system, groundwater, recycled and reclaimed water for conjunctive use. Prioritisation of water demand management to reduce stress on water supply is high on the agenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These strategies are incorporated in the development of the Water Sector Transformation 2040. In the transformation, finance and technology are part of the strategies and implementation.</p>
<h3>Protecting Coastal Resources</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sea level rise (SLR) poses threat to Malaysia&rsquo;s coastal resources. SLR and storm surge projections will be mainstreamed into the Integrated Shoreline Management Plan and for the planning of coastal protection and development projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia utilises the Coastal Vulnerability Index associated with SLR, as an essential indicator to evaluate the vulnerability and risk levels of shoreline. This will be embedded in mapping out vulnerability assessment of different socio- economic segments. Efforts will be focused on intensification of developing coastline SLR-based inundation maps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia focuses on increasing coastal resilience against the impacts of SLR and management of storm surge impacted areas through rehabilitation and protection programs. Adoption of nature-based solutions and green-gray infrastructures will be continuously promoted.</p>
<h3>Securing Agriculture and Food Security in Malaysia</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>The changing of climate patterns also pose risks to the agriculture and food security. Strategies will be implemented to increase the resilience and productivity of climate-vulnerable crops. Crops resilience to climate change will also be intensified through risk mapping and strategic pests and disease control management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research will be carried out to increase climate-tolerant species and varieties. These include augmenting the development of food crop types that can accommodate the demands posed by climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conservation of more major granary areas and expansion of future inland and coastal flood risk assessments on agricultural lands will be implemented to ensure the efficiency of food productivity and raise the self-sufficiency levels. Good and efficient agricultural practices will be further implemented in order to secure continuous agriculture and food supply. These can be achieved through the promotion of smart farming technologies and the implementation of diversification and integrated management.</p>
<h3>Increasing Resilience for Infrastructure and Cities</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>In managing future risks and potential loss from climate change, Malaysia is mainstreaming climate resilience into urban planning and development of infrastructures. This will include emphasising infrastructure integrity assessments and revisions of the existing manuals and guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future planning for waste and wastewater infrastructures will take into account its sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness whilst avoiding areas that are environmentally sensitive, flood-prone and categorised as water catchments. Adopting nature-based solutions such as constructed wetlands in facilitating wastewater treatments will be a priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia also aims to identify, implement and expand innovative and nature- based infrastructure design. Resilient and green city concept will be adopted to ensure future climate risks are managed efficiently.</p>
<h3>Improving Public Health Resilience</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia will expand public health management of future climate risks by adopting evidence-based decision making and improve the projection models in addressing the complex causal relation pathway of climate change and health. Disease management will adopt new models that utilises climatic data to predict changes and impacts of climate-sensitive diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, efforts are undertaken to strengthen surveillance and early warning systems to improve public health preparedness in predicting the future disease impacts. This will be implemented by incorporating weather forecasts into risk maps of climate-sensitive disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical healthcare facilities&rsquo; adaptive capacity will be increased through improving resilience strategies, whilst sustaining essential functions and structures of the public health systems.</p>
<h3>Enhancing Adaptation for Forestry and Biodiversity</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing forest catchment capacity and enhancing management are needed to accommodate expected increase runoff volume and peak flood flow due to higher projected rainfall. It is also crucial to gazette more forest water catchment area in order to maintain and sustain fundamental ecological functions, especially with respect to infiltration rate and soil-water storage capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preservation of vulnerable terrestrial and marine ecosystem and expanding protected areas, including fisheries zones within the marine and coastal protection corridors will be given priority. The ability to manage terrestrial ecosystem is essential and can be enhanced by increasing riparian area management units and reserving larger buffer areas around wetlands, peat swamps and mangroves. Moreover, efforts in establishing reserve to protect ecosystem diversity through enhancing structural and species varieties are also needed.</p>
<h3>Cross Sectoral Efforts: Managing Disaster Risk</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia has ratified the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2015-2030 on 18 March 2015 to reduce disaster risks and loss and damage for better management of socio-economic and environmental impacts. Malaysia will continue the efforts to strengthen the capacity and mechanism in disaster risk management. The integration of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction will be given the focus in the national development plan. Furthermore, Malaysia will continue to be more inclusive and mainstream gender, youth and vulnerable groups in adaptation and disaster risk reduction programs.</p>
<h3>Cross Sectoral Efforts: Climate Financing Support, Technology Transfer and Capacity Building</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia will continue the efforts to explore and optimise the financing mechanism, technology needs assessment and capacity development for climate change impacted sectors to enhance adaptive capacity. Successful implementation of adaptation activities will increase investment and funds from various sources including private sector.</p>
<h3>Cross Sectoral Efforts: Establishment of Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Paris Agreement requires each Party to monitor, evaluate and learn from adaptation planning, policies, programs, and actions. Currently, there is no monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) mechanism or framework established for adaptation. During the development of the National Adaptation Plan, the M&amp;E mechanism will be incorporated and established to ensure successful implementation.</p>
