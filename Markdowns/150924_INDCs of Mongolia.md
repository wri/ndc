MONGOLIA 

 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Submission by Mongolia to  
the Ad-Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) 

 

Introduction  
Mongolia  is  fully  committed  to  the  UNFCCC  negotiation  process  towards  adopting  at  COP21  a  legal 
instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention, applicable to all Parties, in line with 
confining  global  warming  below  2°C.  Mongolia  hereby  communicates  its  intended  nationally  determined 
contribution  to  reiterate  its  determination  to  support  the  multilateral  negotiation  process  and  international 
community efforts in fulfilling the objectives of the UNFCCC. 

National context 
Mongolia is a landlocked country located in the centre of the Eurasian continent in a temperate climate zone. 
The climate is characterised by high fluctuations and  extremes in temperature and precipitation. The annual 
mean temperature ranges from -8°C to 6°C across regions and the annual precipitation varies from 50 mm in 
the  Gobi  desert  to  400  mm  in  the  northern  mountainous  area.  Climate  change  assessments  undertaken  in 
Mongolia in 2009  and 2014, demonstrated that fragile ecosystems, a reliance on pastoral  animal husbandry 
and  rain-fed  agriculture,  and  the  growing  population  with  a  tendency  of  urbanization,  all  combine  to  make 
Mongolia's socio-economic development vulnerable to climate change.  

Development of Mongolia's INDC 
Mongolia's  INDC  has  its  conceptual  roots  in  the  Green  Development  Policy  of  Mongolia,  approved  by  the 
Parliament in 2014, to which key sectorial action plans at the national level, including energy sector, are being 
adjusted.  Key  indicators  for  measuring  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  Green  Development  Policy 
include, among others, efficient use of energy, GHG emissions and ecological footprint per unit of GDP. The 
National Action Programme on Climate Change (NAPCC) endorsed by the Parliament 2011 includes concrete 
measures in response to climate change covering all principal sectors of economy. These and other relevant 
national level policy documents served as a basis for the development of Mongolia's INDC, which was shaped 
and finalized through comprehensive consultation exercises with a broad range of stakeholders.   

Mitigation contribution 
In its INDC, Mongolia has outlined a series of policies and measures that the country  commits to implement 
up  to  2030,  in  the  energy,  industry,  agriculture  and  waste  sectors.  The  expected  mitigation  impact  of  these 
policies and measures will be a 14% reduction in total national GHG emissions excluding Land use, land use 
change  and  forestry  (LULUCF)  by  2030,  compared  to  the  projected  emissions  under  a  business  as  usual 
scenario.  Those  and  other  potentially  more  ambitious  commitments  are  contingent  upon  gaining  access  to 
new technologies and sources of finance through internationally  agreed mechanisms and instruments under 
the auspices of the UNFCCC (see Annex A). 

Adaptation component 
The melting of permafrost and glaciers, surface water shortages, and soil and pasture degradation have been 
identified as particular challenges faced by  Mongolia  as a result of climate change. Due to a high  degree of 
vulnerability  to  climate  change,  adaptation  is  particularly  important  for  Mongolia,  and  as  such  a  distinct 
adaptation  component  is  therefore  included  in  the  INDC.  The  selection  of  priorities  for  the  adaptation 
component is based on a detailed analysis of the expected impacts, potential solutions and challenges, and of 
possible synergies between adaptation and mitigation activities (see Annex B).

Mongolia is also interested to pursue some additional mitigation actions: 

*  Reduce  fuel  use  in  individual  households  through  improving  stove  efficiency  (with  co-benefit  of  air 

pollution reduction),  

*  Transport  (development  of  a  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT)  system  and  improvement  of  the  public 

transport system in Ulaanbaatar),  

*  Agriculture (development of a comprehensive plan for emission reductions in the livestock sub-sector 

for implementation between 2020 and 2030), 

*  Waste sector  (development  of  a waste management  plan, including  recycling,  waste-to-energy,  and 

best management practices),  
Industry (motor-efficiency and housekeeping improvements). 

* 

Furthermore, in the forestry sector, a programme is underway to develop a detailed inventory along with the 
identification of mitigation options. In future communications, Mongolia intends to include actions for mitigation 
in the forestry sector to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation by 2% by 2020 and 
5% by 2030 (according to State policy on forest, 2015). 

4. Sectors 

The  INDC  of  Mongolia  includes  proposed  measures  and  additional  actions  for  energy  (including  transport), 
industrial  processes,  agriculture  and  waste.  Projected  emissions  by  sector  for  2010  and  2030  are  shown  in

GHG  emissions,  reported  here,  exclude  LULUCF  sector,  which  are  currently  being  estimated  through  the 
preparation  of  a  national  GHG  inventory,  within  scope  of  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment, 
Green Development and Tourism of Mongolia (MEGDT).  

 

5. GHG emission reductions 

In  order  to  facilitate  clarity,  transparency  and  understanding,  this  section  provides  an  indicative  estimate  of 
potential emission reductions for the measures targeting all major GHG gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in the sectors 
mentioned. 

The  cumulative  impact  of  the  measures  listed  in  Table  1  is  estimated  to  result  in  approximately  an  annual 
reduction of 7.3 Mt CO2-eq. of economy-wide emissions in 2030, corresponding to a 14% reduction compared

6. Accounting methodologies 

The  latest  official  GHG  emissions  inventory  was  compiled  for  the  year  2006  using  the  Revised  1996  IPCC 
Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventories,  as  described  in  Mongolia's  Second  National 
Communication  (SNC).  The  projected  emissions  for  2010,  as  indicated  in this  document,  were presented  in 
the SNC. The BAU baseline was defined according to the methodology given in Mongolia's SNC.  

Indicative  emission  reductions  were  determined  using  LEAP  modelling  (energy:  power  and  heat;  energy: 
transport)  and  Revised  1996  IPCC  Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventories  (industry).  A 
description of the methodology could be found in the INDC detailed report. The potential impact of agricultural 
emission reduction measures could not be estimated due to lack of available background information, and are 
thus  not  included  in  the  indicative  estimate.  Actual  and  forecast  emission  reductions  will  be  recalculated 
annually,  based  on  improved  data  availability  and  appropriate  adjustments  to  the  BAU  baseline's 
assumptions. 

7. Fairness and ambition 

Mongolia has a low responsibility for climate change mitigation in terms of its historic emissions, and limited 
capacity due to relatively challenging environmental conditions including a long lasting heating season, a coal 
based electricity production system, a lack of access to cleaner fossil fuels and a highly dispersed population 
particularly in remote areas (lack of access to the electricity grid). This has led to a high emissions per capita 
ratio.  Mongolia  is  committed  to  the  decarbonisation  of  its  growing  economy  and  intends  to  reduce  its 
emissions intensity by implementing the proposed measures. 

The  proposed  targets  have  their  origins  in  the  Green  Development  Policy  of  Mongolia,  which  is  an  over-
arching  and  comprehensive  approach  to  deliver  low-carbon  economic  growth  taking  into  account  national 
circumstances  in  the  context  of  its  sustainable  development.  This  ambitious  strategy  mainstreams  both 
mitigation and adaptation in a way to reduce social and environmental vulnerability. Parliamentary approval of 
the most significant energy measures, and corresponding commitment to implement an important part of the 
mitigation actions with domestic means, demonstrates the ambition of the Mongolian Government. 

8. Planning process and means of implementation 

Planning Processes 

The  Ministry  of  Environment,  Green  Development  and  Tourism  is  the  key  ministry  to  develop,  update  and 
implement climate related policies. In addition, other line ministries including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry 

 
of Energy, Ministry of Industry,  Ministry of Building and Urban Development, Ministry of Road and Transport 
and Ministry of Agriculture will be involved. 
The elaboration of this INDC involved a multi-stakeholder process and consultations with key public bodies. It 
is largely based on existing legal frameworks and adopted policies of the Mongolian government, approved by 
the Parliament. Domestic legally-binding legislation already in place includes: 

*  Green development policy, 2014 (2014-2030) 
*  National Action Programme on Climate Change (NAPCC), 2011 (2011-2021)   
*  State policy on energy, 2015 (2015-2030) 
*  National agriculture development policy, 2010 (2010-2021)  
*  State policy on forest, 2015 (2016-2030) 
*  MDGs based comprehensive national development programme, 2008 (2008-2021) 
*  Law on renewable energy, 2015 
*  Law on energy, 2015  
*  State policy on Industry, 2015 (2015-2030) 

Majority of the development and climate policies and programmes cover periods up to 2016 and 2020. Thus, 
during  the  period  of  2016-2020,  Mongolia  will  elaborate  relevant  policy  documents  for  consultation  at  the 
national level for its development and national climate policies for the period 2021-2030. Progress towards the 
fulfilment of the contribution will be assessed through an annual review of the implementation progress of the 
proposed policies and measures.  

Means of implementation 

The  measures  outlined  in  this  INDC  have  been  presented  as  legislation  and/or  proposed  in  national 
development  strategies  and  plans.  As  such,  responsibility  for  implementation  will  follow  existing  institutional 
arrangements that define roles and responsibilities for the relevant sectors. In order to successfully implement 
the policies and measures as part of this contribution (Table 1), as well as the proposed additional measures 
(described in section 3b), Mongolia will seek international funding, capacity building and technology supports 
to  complement  its  domestic  resource  allocations  and  efforts.  Mongolia  will  articulate  its  specific  needs,  and 
communicate  the  potential  supporting  role of  the  international  community.  As  a  preliminary  indication,  some 
specific  measures  that  will  be  important  to  reach  the  proposed  targets  are  described  in  Table  2,  with 
estimated  investment  needs  of  3.5  billion  USD.  The  anticipated  financing  modalities  will  be  described  at  a 
later  date,  but  a substantial  private  sector  share  is  expected  (leveraged  by  public  funds)  to be  a  part  of  the 
funding.  Mongolia  is  interested  in  opportunities  to  access  international  climate  funds  namely  the  Green 
Climate Fund and in participation with crediting mechanisms to implement these measures.

1. Rationale for Adaptation 

Annex B: Adaptation component 

Considering  the  importance  of  adaptation  to  climate  change  in  Mongolia,  this  adaptation  component  has 
been  included  in  the  INDC,  due  to  its  high  degree  of  vulnerability  to  climate  change.  It  is  based  on  a 
detailed  analysis of the anticipated impacts of climate change and those challenges  would pose to socio-
economic  development.  Adaptation  targets  have  been  identified,  along  with  the  funding,  capacity,  and 
technologies necessary to achieve them. Implementing these actions will support sustainable development 
and  improve  Mongolia's  resilience  to  climate  change.  There  is  a  need  further  to  use  more  differentiated 
approaches  such  as  defining  the  role  of  passive  adaptation  based  on  traditional  ways  of  life,  active 
adaptation  based  on  gained  knowledge  and  experiences,  and  proactive  adaptation  involving  modern 
technology and know-how. 

2. Summary of climate change trends, impacts and vulnerabilities  

The  annual  mean  air  temperature  over  Mongolia  has  increased  by  2.07°C  from  1940  to  2014.  The  ten 
warmest  years  in  the  last  70  years  have  occurred  since  1997.  In  this  period,  annual  precipitation  has 
decreased  slightly  and  the  seasonal  rainfall  pattern  has  changed:  winter  precipitation  has  gradually 
increased  and  summer  rain  has  decreased  in  some  regions.  Climate  projections  show  intensification  of 
these changes in the first half of the 21st century. Some of the key impacts and vulnerabilities are: 

*  Approximately 70% of pastoral land has degraded, while changing plant composition.  

*  Winter dzud (heavy snow, cold waves, storms etc.) risk is likely to increase leading to more losses in 

livestock sector. 

*  Non-irrigated crop production is becoming more unstable. Assessments show that wheat production 

might be decreased by 15% by 2030 due to climate change. 

*  The drying up of lakes, rivers and springs and melting of glaciers has intensified in the last decades. 
The recent surface water resource inventory confirmed that 12% of rivers, 21% of lakes and 15% of 
springs  have  dried  up.  Water  temperature  and  evaporation  are  continuously  increasing,  leading  to 
declining water resources. 

*  The intensification of dry climatic conditions cause the increase of the frequency of forest and steppe 
fires, the occurrence and the intensity of forest insect and pest outbreaks. As a result, the forest area 
is reduced by 0.46% annually, and forest resources have been degraded significantly.   

*  The  frequency  of  extreme  weather  phenomena  has  doubled  in  the  last  two  decades.  This  is 

expected to increase by 23-60% by the middle of the century as compared to present conditions. 

Assessment of current and future impact of climate change confirms that animal husbandry, arable farming, 
human  health,  and  natural  resources  including  water,  forest,  pasture  and  soil  are  the  most  vulnerable 
sectors in Mongolia, and also reinforces the importance of natural disaster management.   

3.  Long and short-term adaptation visions, goals and targets  

Vision for adaptation: Increased adaptive capacity to overcome negative impacts of climate change, and 
to strengthen resilience of ecosystem and socio-economic sectors.  

Adaptation aims to reduce risks and vulnerabilities for the following sectors: 

*  Animal husbandry aims to maintain ecosystem balance through improving pasture management.  
*  Arable  farming  aspires  to  meet  the  total  national  need  in crops  by  reducing bare fallow  and  soil 
moisture loss, introducing medium and long-term varieties of crops, increased irrigation with water 
saving technologies including snow, and rain water harvesting.    

 
*  Water resources sector's objectives are to expand state protected areas covering especially river 
headwater  areas,  where  70%  of  water  resources  are  formed,  to  ensure  proper  use  of  water 
resources, and  to strengthen integrated water resource management in river basins. 

*  Forest  resource  aims  to  reduce  forest  degradation,  and  to  implement  re-forestation  and 

sustainable forest management strategies. 

*  Natural  disaster  management  seeks  to  build  effective  disaster  management  to  prevent 

environmental and socio-economic losses.  

Some adaptation activities under these goals will also have mitigation co-benefits: 

* 

Improving  pasture  management  would  increase  the  carbon  sink  of  CO2  equivalent  to  29  million 
tons per year, which is equal to 1/3 of emission reduction in energy sector. 

*  Reducing bare fallow to 30% in rain-fed crop land, increasing variety of crops, zero-tillage and crop 

rotation would consequently increase a carbon sink. 

* 

* 

Increasing protected areas up to 25-30% of the total territory will help maintain natural ecosystems 
and preserve water resources with a certain synergy effects for emission reduction. 

Increasing  forest  area  up  to  9.0%  by  2030  and  reducing  forest  fire  affected  area  by  30%  would 
conserve ecosystems and increase carbon sink. 

In general, carbon sinks of natural ecosystems will be increased with a capacity to  absorb almost a half of 
the  CO2  emissions  from  energy  sector  in  the  country  by  implementing  adaptation  policies  in  agriculture, 
forestry, and water resource sectors.  

4.  Current and planned adaptation undertakings 

Animal  husbandry  and  pasture:  Every  year,  around  1.0  million  USD  is  allocated  from  Government 
budget  to  facilitate  scientific,  environmentally  sound  measures  against  pasture  insects  and  rodents. 
Monitoring system for pasture and soil has been created and is being strengthened. 

Existing national policy documents include strategic objectives to protect pasture, which occupy about 80% 
of  the  territory.  These  objectives  include  improved  pasture  management,  regulation  of  livestock  numbers 
and herds' composition by matching with pasture carrying capacities, improved animal breeds, and regional 
development of intensified animal farming.  

Arable farming: As of 2015, the total cropland has been accounted as 750 thousand ha and 450 thousand 
ha is re-used cropland, which was abandoned. Drip irrigation systems have been experimented since 1997 
and currently used for limited area of vegetable field.   

Water  resource:  As  of  2015,  state  protected  area  covers  17.4%  of  the  total  national  land  including  a 
certain part of river headwater areas. Integrated river basin management plans have been developed for 7 
river basins out of the planned 29. 

Forestry:  Community  based  forest  resource  management  has  been  introduced  and  about  20%  of  the 
forest  area is  currently  under  protection  of  community  forestry  groups,  which comprise 74.8%  of  the  total 
community  groups  on  environmental  protection.  Multi-purpose  forest  resource  inventory  is  under  the 
process. 

5. Gaps and barriers  

Mongolia  faces  some  challenges  in  mobilization  of  its  full  potential  to  achieve  the  adaptation  goals  and 
targets.  Major barriers include: 

*  A lack of funding, financial incentives and investments.  

*  Challenges  to  introduce  advanced  new  technologies  and  equipment  due  to  lack  of  domestic 

 
production. 

*  Weak  management  of  disaster  risks  at  local  level,  weak  and  inadequate  early  warning  systems  for 

prevention of droughts and dzuds, a lack of an enabling legal environment. 

*  Weak coordination and integration among various sectors. 

* 

Insufficient  human  resources  capacity  and  a  lack  of  technical  training  on  climate  change  and  limited 
engagement of academic institutions.  

*  Weak monitoring and evaluation system for sectors, climate events and programmes.  

6. Summary of adaptation needs  

Based on current adaptation undertakings and gaps, the needs to achieve adaptation goals and targets for 
2021-2030 are given in (Table 3). 

Rough estimations  of  adaptation  measures,  listed  in  Table 3,  shows  that  in  the  future Mongolia  will  need 
around 3.4 billion USD for funding in technology and capacity building. Up to 80% of total need expected to 
be financed from international sources and donor institutions.

7. Monitoring and reporting process  

Monitoring  of  climate  change  adaptation  measures  will  be  conducted  in  an  integrated  way  as  per  the 
existing national programmes.   

Required  funding  for  adaptation  measures,  listed  in  Table  3,  could  be  provided  from  State  budget, 
Government special funds, international funds and through other financial mechanisms.  

Monitoring  will  be  based  on  achievement  of  adaptation  goals  and  targets.  Baselines  and  targets  for 
indicators will be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively at every phase of its implementation.
