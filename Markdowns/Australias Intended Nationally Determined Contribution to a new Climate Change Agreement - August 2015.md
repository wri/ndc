Australia's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to a new Climate Change 
Agreement | August 2015 

 
 

I. Australia's commitment  
 
Australia wants the United Nations climate change conference in Paris to deliver a strong 
and effective new global climate change agreement, applicable to all UNFCCC Parties.  
 
Australia has a strong record of meeting our commitments, and we are on track to meet our 
2020 target. Our direct action policy, including the Emissions Reduction Fund, is supporting 
businesses and the community to reduce emissions, while improving productivity and 
sustaining economic growth.  
 
Australia will continue to play our part in an effective global response to climate change. 
Under a Paris Agreement applicable to all, Australia will implement an economy-wide target 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The 
details of Australia's contribution are set out in the attachment to aid transparency, clarity 
and understanding. 
 
Australia's target is unconditional based on assumptions set out in the attachment. We will 
implement the 28 per cent target should circumstances allow, taking into account 
opportunities to reduce emissions and factors such as the costs of technology. Australia 
reserves the right to adjust our target and its parameters before it is finalised under a new 
global agreement should the rules and other underpinning arrangements of the agreement 
differ in a way that materially impacts the definition of our target.  
 
II. A fair and ambitious contribution to deliver the Convention's objective  

 

Australia's intended nationally determined contribution is an ambitious, fair and responsible 
contribution to global efforts toward meeting the objective of the UNFCCC with the goal of 
limiting global average temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius.  
 
The target is a significant progression beyond Australia's 2020 commitment to cut emissions 
by five per cent below 2000 levels (equivalent to 13 per cent below 2005 levels). The target 
approximately doubles Australia's rate of emissions reductions, and significantly reduces 
emissions per capita and per unit of GDP, when compared to the 2020 target. Across a range 
of metrics, Australia's target is comparable to the targets of other advanced economies. 
Against 2005 levels, Australia's target represents projected cuts of 50 to 52 per cent in 
emissions per capita by 2030 and 64 to 65 per cent per unit of GDP by 2030. 
 
The target represents serious and ambitious effort for Australia. This effort takes account of 
Australia's unique national circumstances, including a growing population and economy, role 
as a leading global resources provider, our current energy infrastructure, and higher than 
average abatement costs. The target places Australia on a stable pathway towards longer 
term emissions reductions in the context of future global action and technological 
innovation. 

 
 

 
III. Planning processes towards achieving Australia's target 
 
Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund supports Australian businesses to reduce emissions 
while improving productivity. The first auction under the Fund was held in April 2015, and 
successfully purchased over 47 million tonnes of abatement at an average price of 
AU$13.95. The Government is finalising a safeguard mechanism to ensure emissions 
reductions purchased under the Fund are not offset by significant rises in emissions 
elsewhere in the economy. Australia has additional policy measures in place to promote the 
deployment of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency. Under Australia's 
Renewable Energy Target scheme, over 23 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from 
renewable sources by 2020.  
 
The Australian Government is working to build climate resilience and support adaptation to 
climate change. Australia will develop a National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy 
during 2015.  
 
The Australian Government is commencing the development of a range of policies that will 
reduce emissions into the post-2020 period, including a National Energy Productivity Plan 
with a National Energy Productivity Target of a 40 per cent improvement between 2015 and 
2030, the investigation of opportunities to improve the efficiency of light and heavy vehicles, 
and the enhanced management of synthetic greenhouse gas emissions under ozone 
protection laws and the Montreal Protocol. 
 
Building from these measures, the Australian Government will in 2017-2018 undertake 
consultation to determine further post-2020 domestic emissions reduction policies. The 
Government will ensure that policies used in the post-2020 period are efficient and 
complementary with one another, and are appropriately calibrated towards achieving 
Australia's 2030 target. As a part of this process, the Government will consider a potential 
long term emissions reduction goal for Australia, beyond 2030, taking into account 
international trends and technology developments.

100 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and removals in Australia's

Assumptions and methodological approaches for emissions estimates and accounting 

Metrics 

Australia intends to apply 100 year Global Warming Potentials 
(GWPs) as contained in inventory reporting guidelines, currently IPCC 
Fourth Assessment Report 100 year GWPs, or as otherwise agreed. 

Emissions estimation 
methodology 

Australia intends to apply the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and IPCC 2013 
Revised Supplementary Methods, or as otherwise agreed. 

Accounting approach 

Australia intends to account based on UNFCCC inventory reporting 
categories using a net-net approach. Australia will apply IPCC 
guidance for treatment of natural disturbance and variation.  
Australia's INDC assumes that accounting provisions under the Paris 
agreement will: 

-  Preserve the integrity of the agreement by ensuring claimed 

emissions reductions are genuine and are not double 
counted; and 

-  Recognise emissions reductions from all sectors. 

Australia reserves the right to adjust our target and its parameters before it is finalised under a 
new global agreement should the rules and other underpinning arrangements of the 
agreement differ in a way that materially impacts the definition of our target.
