The  Bahamas  is  pleased  to  communicate  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined 
contribution  and 
facilitate  clarity, 
transparency and understanding under decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20.  
 
 
Introduction 
 
The  vulnerability  of  The  Bahamas  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  is  well 
known  given  its  geographical  vulnerabilities  (limited  land  masses,  low-relief 
and  dispersion  of  islands),  environmental  vulnerabilities  (high  temperatures, 
storm  surges,  sea  level  rise,  flooding,  tropical  cyclones  and  non-tropical 
processes),  the  concentration  of  socio-economic  activities  and  critical 
infrastructure  in  narrow  coastal  zones,  its  dependence  on  tourism  and  the 
limited  human  and  institutional  capacity.  The  Bahamas  is  also  highly 
dependent on the imports of fossil fuels for energy needs which places a heavy 
burden on its economies as a result of the vagaries of global petroleum prices. 
 
Based  on  the  available  scientific  consensus  we  can  expect  more  frequent  and 
intense impacts over time.  
 
It is within this context that The Bahamas is expected to adapt to the impacts 
of  climate  change  while  at  the  same  time  pursue  a  low  carbon  pathway  in 
conformity  to  growing  international  and  public  pressure  for  environmentally 
friendly  development  that  reduces  their  "carbon  footprint"  and  exposure  to 
climate change, while also increasing energy security.   
 
In  response  to  the  challenges  faced  by  climate  change,  The  Bahamas  has 
developed a National Climate Adaptation Policy (2006), a National Energy Policy 
(2013)  and  amended  its  Forestry  Act  (2014).  The  Bahamas  has  also  worked 

 

1 | Bahamas 

together  with  other  CARICOM  countries  to  form  an  implementation  plan  to 
deliver the strategic elements and goals of a Regional Framework for Achieving 
Development Resilient to Climate Change (2009-2015) which was developed to 
manage the effects of climate change on development.  
 
Under preparation is a pilot project in Harbour Island to test and demonstrate 
ways  of  transitioning  to  a  low  carbon  and  climate  resilient  development 
pathway.  
 
Despite these efforts, in order to respond to rising sea levels, the salinization of 
fresh  ground  water  resources  and  the  loss  of  potable  water  across  The 
Bahamas  a  rapid  transition  to  the  use  of  reverse  osmosis  facilities  to  provide 
for this essential service has resulted in an increased dependence on processed 
water to meet the needs of a tourism and services dependent economy. The net 
effect is that in responding to climate change and increased use of fossil fuels 
has resulted as well as a dependence on imported technologies. 
 
This  document  presents  The  Bahamas'  Intended  Nationally  Determined 
Contribution (INDC) in accordance with Decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, of the 
United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  that 
invites  Parties  to  communicate  to  the  Secretariat  their  INDCs  towards 
achieving the objective of the UNFCCC as set out in Article 2 of the Convention.    
 
 
The Planning Process 
 
The  Bahamas  INDC  builds  on  the  participatory  multi-stakeholder  and  cross-
sectoral  consultative  processes  undertaken  during  the  development  of  the 
Bahamas  Initial  and  Second  National  Communications  to  the  UNFCCC,  its 
National  Energy  Policy  as  well  as  the  formulation  of  a  mitigation  assessment 
using  the  Long  Range  Energy  Alternatives  Planning  (LEAP)  model  for  the 
Commonwealth of The Bahamas.  
These  processes  created  genuine  national  ownership  of  the  INDC  and 
highlighted synergies with other UNFCCC-related processes. 
 
 
National Circumstances 
 
The  Bahamas  consists  of  an  archipelago  of  700  islands  and  more  than  200 
cays,  islets  and  rocks  in  the  western  Atlantic  Ocean.  The  islands  cover 
approximately  100,000  square  miles  (mi2)  of  ocean  between  latitudes  21°  and 
27° North and longitudes 72° and 79° West with a total land area of only 5,382 

2 | Bahamas 

 

mi2 (13,940 km2). Much of the land is a few metres above  mean sea level and 
the  highest  point  is  only  206  ft  (63  m)  above  mean  sea  level  and  the 
hydrological  records  indicate  that  sea  level  has  risen  over  the  past  century  by 
one foot (or 0.3 meters). 
 
The  economy  is  mainly  based  on  Tourism  which  is  the  major  contributor  to 
GDP and foreign exchange earnings of The Bahamas with the financial services 
sector  being  the  second  largest  contributor  to  GDP.  The  banking  and  finance 
sector  accounts  for  approximately  15%  of  GDP.    The  Bahamas  is  one  of  the 
world's  fastest  growing  of  the  larger  ship  registry  centres,  with  nearly  1,600 
vessels.  There  is  a  small  but  growing  industrial  sector,  and  Grand  Bahama  is 
home  to  several  industries  that  include  crude  oil  storage  for  trans-shipment. 
New Providence, the island on which the country's capital is located, is home to 
brewing, distilling and light manufacturing. There are a number of companies 
that  produce  paper  products,  furniture  and  bedding,  and  a  small  food 
processing  industry.  The  agriculture  and  fisheries  sectors  combined  account 
for 3 to 5% of GDP. 
 
Statistics  from  the  World  Bank  show  that  The  Bahamas'  contribution  to  the 
total global greenhouse gas emissions is almost negligible  - 0.01%. Significant 
sources of GHG emission come from the energy and transport sectors.  
 
 
Adaptation 
 
Recognizing  that  mitigation  alone  will  not  protect  us  from  the  negative  effects 
associated  with  a  changing  climate;  The  Bahamas  understands  the  urgent 
need for adaptation. 
 
Adaptation  activities  are  important  to  The  Bahamas  for  the  survival  of  its 
people and alleviation of poverty. For example, sea level rise  will result in loss 
of fresh water lens which will increase the inhabitant's dependence on Reverse 
Osmosis  (RO)  for  the  production  of  potable  water.  These  plants  are  expensive 
and  fossil  fuel  intensive,  thus  increasing  GHG  emissions.  The  cost  of  doing 
business  is  predicated  on  basic  input,  energy  and  water,  which  determines 
electric supply. As these costs continue to  rise, primarily due to adaptation to 
climate  change,  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  The  Bahamas  becomes 
significantly higher. This creates a domino effect and has negative implications 
for the country's economic outlook and stability.  
 
Cognizant of the potential further impacts of climate change, The Bahamas has 
expanded  its  adaptation  focus.  Near  shore  marine  environments  play  an 
integral  role  in  the  protection  of  the  critical  infrastructure  across  the 
archipelago.    In  2008,  as  a  part  of  the  Caribbean  Challenge  Initiative,  we 

3 | Bahamas 

 

committed  to  the  protection  of  20%  of  our  near  shore  marine  environment  by 
2020,  and  have  this  year  achieved  half of  our  goal.  These  protected  areas  will 
conserve and protect habitat for Grouper and Bonefish spawning aggregations, 
coral reefs, sea grass meadows, mangrove nurseries and important bird areas.  
There are many other sectors that require extensive measures of adaptation.

Mitigation 
 
In  light  of  the  expected  climate  change  impacts  for  The  Bahamas  and,  taking 
into  account  its  tourism  based  economy,  taking  action  to  implement  climate 
change mitigation policies in the country is necessary to reduce climate change 
impacts  and  assume  responsibility  for  the  country's  GHG  emissions.  The 
Government  of  The  Bahamas  has  recognized  the  importance  of  addressing 
climate  change  both  from  a  mitigation  and  adaptation  perspective  and  is 
committed  to  playing  its  part  as  a  responsible  member  of  the  global 
community,  and  as  a  signatory  to  the  UNFCCC,  making  efforts  to  achieve  the 
objective of the UNFCCC, regardless of our contribution on a global scale.  
 
The electricity and transport sectors are the main usage sectors of fossil fuels 
in  the  country  and  the  electricity  demand  is  expected  to  increase  in  the 
medium  term.  Accordingly  the  Government  has  defined  the  policy  framework 
for  a  low  carbon  development  plan  through  the  National  Energy  Policy,  that 
sets  a  target  to  achieve  a  minimum  of    30%  renewables  in  the  energy  mix  by 
2030  and  will  allow  for  a  10%  Residential  Energy  Self  Generation  Programme 
within the year.  This comprehensive programme of efficiency improvement and 
energy  diversification  will  allow  The  Bahamas  to  provide  high-quality, 
affordable,  environmentally-friendly  energy  and  to  reduce  the  amounts  of 
imported  oil  that  the  country  uses.  Energy  diversification  will  involve  moving 
from  a  high  dependence  on  petroleum  to  increase  the  contribution  of  other 
sources  such  as  renewable  energy  from  solar,  ocean  and  wind.  Indeed,  The 
Bahamas  is  well  positioned  to  tap  local  renewable  energy  resources  such  as 
wind and sun.  
 
Through  Public  Private  Partnerships  and  government  funding,  The  Bahamas 
will  focus  on  the  development  of  indigenous  renewable  energy  resources  with 
the  goal  of  increasing  the  percentage  of  renewables  in  the  energy  mix  to  a 
minimum  of  30%  by  2030.  For  The  Bahamas,  as  for  many  non-oil  producing 
nations,  the  development  and  diffusion  of  renewable  energy  resources  and 
technologies  will  help  realize  important  economic,  environmental  and  social 
objectives.  Renewable  resources  such  as  wind,  solar,  waste-to-energy  and 
biomass  are  indigenous  to  the  country,  and  if  developed  adequately,  can 
provide  cleaner,  and  in  the  long  term,  more  affordable  alternatives  to  fossil 
fuels. This will not only lower the country's oil bill but also will improve energy 
security  through  diversification  of  the  energy  base.  Also,  increased  use  of 
renewable  energy  will  lessen  environmental  impacts  and  reduce  the  country's 
carbon footprint - and thus its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
The  Bahamas  National  Energy  Policy  establishes  linkages  with  other  sectors, 
(transport, construction, finance, inter alia) of the economy in order to achieve 
policy coherence and fulfill the achievement of the country's energy goals.

The transport sector will play a strategic role in ensuring that it becomes more 
energy  efficient.  To  this  end,  a  range  of  strategic  interventions  will  be 
undertaken.  For  example,  the  transport  sector  strategy  will  discourage  the 
importation  of  inefficient  motor  vehicles  by  linking  the  tax  regime  to  mileage 
per  gallon  and  the  engine  capacity  and  also  by  lowering  import  duties  on 
hybrid  and  electric  cars.  The  transportation  policy  will  encourage  the 
development and implementation of energy related measures such as: efficient 
traffic  management;  carpooling;  park  and  ride;  use  of  clean  fuels  to  minimize 
pollution; flexi-work hours and tele-commuting; an efficient public/urban mass 
transit transport system; encouraging non-motorized transport; and promoting 
vehicle  and  road  maintenance  programmes.  Supporting  legislation  and 
infrastructure for use of biofuels will be put in place. 
 
The  construction  industry  will  be  held  to  the  energy  efficiency  standards 
outlined  in  an  energy-efficiency  building  code;  this  will  require  architects  and 
engineers to design, build and renovate buildings to incorporate energy efficient 
lighting and cooling  systems and utilize  building materials and employ energy 
efficient  construction  methodologies.  Consideration  will  also  be  given  to 
providing  incentives  for  constructing  carbon  neutral  buildings  that  would  use 
no energy from the national power grid but focus more on renewable and more 
sustainable  energy  sources.  Energy  conservation  and  efficiency  and  use  of 
renewable energy also will be further promoted and facilitated for the hotel and 
tourism  industry.    This  will  lead  to  a  more  sustainable  and  green  tourism 
industry,  which  is  becoming  increasingly  important  in  the  global  tourism 
arena. 
 
The  Finance  Ministry  will  develop  and  implement  a  programme  of  incentives 
and fiscal measures to enable and support investments in modern facilities and 
infrastructure  in  the  energy  sector;  energy  efficiency  and  conservation 
initiatives;  and  the  further  advancement  of  renewable  energy  options.  The 
domestic financial sector will actively seek to participate in investing in energy 
sector  development.  It  will  be  important  for  adequate  information  to  be 
disseminated  and  incentives  to  be  created  to  enable  the  participation  of  local 
financial  institutions  in  the  financing  of  energy  projects,  particularly  those 
related to renewable energy. A system of shared decision making will be stated 
and  agreed  upon.  This  will  ensure  that  economic  decisions  that  consider 
energy-related  issues  are  collaborative  and  would  also  ensure  that  those 
decisions are consistent with the Bahamas National Energy Policy. 
 
In  addition  to  The  Bahamas  National  Energy  Policy,  the  Forestry  Act  was 
amended to allow for the establishment of a permanent forest estate. Under the 
amended Act, 20% of the land cover is designated into one of three categories 
(forest reserves, protected forests and conservation forests) and will be subject 
to  a  management  plan 
for  suitable  management  and  environmental 

7 | Bahamas 

 

conservation. The establishment of the National Forest Estate will deliver global 
environmental  benefits  along  with  domestic  livelihood  support  and  human 
development.  It  will  safeguard  future  land  degradation  on  the  Pine  Forest 
Islands  through  the  improvement  of  the  provision  of  forest  ecosystem  goods 
and  services.  It  will  reduce  GHG  emissions  from  deforestation  and  forest 
degradation  and  increase  carbon  sequestration.  Results  of  a  mangrove 
ecosystem  study  on  one  Pine  Island  (Andros)  indicate  that  approximately 
5,661,077tCO2eq  may  be  removed  from  the  atmosphere  through  the  proper 
management  of  the  ecosystem.  Proper  management  will 
improve  the 
functionality  of  our  mangrove  ecosystems  and  increase  their  carbon  sink 
ability.  It  will  also  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  forest  ecosystems  to  climate 
change  and  other  human-induced  impacts:  due  to  improved  harvesting 
practices  reducing  human  impacts  while  increasing  the  productivity  in  forest 
dependent communities.  
 
These Pine Islands and other designated National Forests across The Bahamas 
may be considered for inclusion in REDD+ activities, pending further study.

Fairness and ambition 
 
Through  various  national  policies  and  initiatives,  it  is  estimated  that  The 
Bahamas will reduce its emissions by a minimum of 30% below 2002 levels. 
 
Based on its national circumstances, The Bahamas believes its target to be fair 
and  ambitious  considering  its  genuine  efforts  to  move  forward  in  an  effective 
manner  to  maintain  sustainability  while  at  the  same  time  facilitating  its 
transition  to  a  low-carbon  and  climate-resilient  economy.  The  Bahamas' 
contribution  exceeds  the  requirements  for  Small  Island  Developing  States  as 
decided  in  Decision  1  CP/20  paragraph  11  which  states  that  "small  island 
developing  states  may  communicate  information  on  strategies,  plans  and 
actions  for  low  greenhouse  gas  emission  development  reflecting  their  special 
circumstances in the context of intended nationally determined contributions"  
 
It  is  important  to  The  Bahamas  that  in  order  to  meet  the  below  1.5-  2 C 
objective, each Party must undertake mitigation actions based on the common 
but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in accordance with 
the Convention. 
 
 
Means of Implementation 
 
Until  this  point,  The  Bahamas  collective  efforts  to  respond  to  the  climate 
challenge have been realized largely through the use of national resources. In a 
similar  manner  efforts  to  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  have 
come  with  limited  or  no  support  from  the  international  community.  The 
Bahamas intends to achieve these mitigation actions through an economy-wide 
in  GHG  emission  of  30%  when  compared  to  its  Business  as  Usual  (BAU) 
scenario by 2030. 
 
The  Bahamas  will  require  international  support  in  the  form  of  finance, 
investment,  technology  development  and  transfer  and  capacity-building  in  its 
efforts  to  capitalize  on  greater  utilization  of  renewable  sources  of  energy  and 
adapt  to  the  negative  impacts  of  climate  change  that  affect  various  sectors  of 

9 | Bahamas 

 

the economy. The implementation of the INDC is estimated to cost in excess of 
900  million  dollars  to  implement  mitigation  actions  alone,  through  2030.  The 
cost  for  implementation  is  anticipated  to  be  met  through  multilateral  and 
bilateral support from a variety of sources, instruments and on varying access 
terms.  The  Bahamas  has  limited  experience  using  market  mechanisms  under 
the  Kyoto  Protocol;  however,  it  is  open  to  the  consideration  of  market 
mechanisms.   
 
The Bahamas will undertake a cost analysis to determine the cost to implement 
adaptation actions. 

 
Additional information 
 
The  Commonwealth  of  The  Bahamas  has  since  becoming  a  sovereign 
independent  small  island  developing  state  made  tremendous  strides  in 
providing  for  its  citizenry  universal  access  to  education,  potable  water, 
telecommunications,  electricity,  transport  services  and  health  care  across  the 
entire Commonwealth of islands. 
 
The  passage  of  hurricane  Joaquin  which  devastated  the  south  central 
Bahamas  in  October  dramatizes  the  vulnerability  of  our  people.  Post  Joaquin, 
the islands in the South Central Bahamas have experienced extensive damages 
to  built  environment,  infrastructure,  homes  and  schools  and  significant 
economic  losses  in  the  tens  of  millions  of  dollars.  The  storm  has  directly 
affected  some  5  -  10  000  people.  Initial  estimates  to  replace  damaged 
infrastructure are in excess of 60 million dollars. 
 
The adverse impacts of climate change were demonstrated and exacerbated by 
our geographical (limited land masses, low-relief and dispersion of islands) and 
environmental  (high  temperatures,  storm  surges,  sea  level  rise,  flooding, 
tropical  cyclones  and  non-tropical  processes)  vulnerabilities.  Concentration  of 
socio-economic  activities,  critical  infrastructure  in  narrow  coastal  zones, 
dependence  on  tourism  and  limited  human  and  institutional  capacity  are  all 
factors that make The Bahamas vulnerable to climate change.
