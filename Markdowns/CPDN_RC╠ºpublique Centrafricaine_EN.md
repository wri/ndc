INTRODUCTION 

The  Central  African  Republic  is  a  landlocked  African  country  with  an  area  of  around  623,000  km2.  
The  terrain  consists  of  a  vast  peneplain  dominated  by  two  mountain  ranges  at  its  eastern  and 

western ends joined by a central spine that separates the two principal drainages, the Chari-Longue 

basin in the north and the Congo basin in the south.  

The  climate  is  hot  and  humid  equatorial,  characterised  by  two  seasons:  a  dry  season  and  a  rainy 

season. The rainfall varies between 800 mm in the north and 1600 mm in the south and the average 

annual  temperature  varies  between 15  °C  in  the  south  and  38  °C  in  the  north. The  future  scenario 

indicates  an  increase  in  temperature  on  the  order  of  1.4  to  2.2°C,  assuming  low  greenhouse  gas 

emissions, and 1.8 to 2.7°C, assuming high greenhouse gas emissions. The forecasts regarding change 

in precipitation are less clear. Some forecasts predict a slight increase in annual precipitation, while 

others  project  irregular  variations  in  precipitation.  The  extreme  climate  hazards,  the  probability  of 

which could increase with climate change, are torrential rains followed by floods and droughts.  

From south to north, the biological diversity is composed of five large phytogeographic zones, each 

with  a  specific  fauna:  the  Guinean  forest  zone  of  dense  humid  forests; the  Sudano-Ubangian  zone, 

sheltering dense semi-humid, open and dry forests; the Sudano-Guinean and Sudano-Sahelian zones, 

composed of various types of savannahs; and the Sahelian zone, consisting of steppes. 

The population of the Central African Republic is estimated at 5 million, with a demographic growth 

on the order of 2.5%/year. It is predominantly rural (62.1%), female (50.2%) and young (49.4% less 

than  18  years  of  age).  The  country  is  sparsely  and  unevenly  populated.  The  average  population 
density is 7.2 inhabitants per Km2. Decades of military and political crises have destroyed the nascent 
development  and  the  last  conflict  of  2012-2013  spread  insecurity  throughout  the  population, 

destroyed the productive fabric and dismantled the administrative machinery. 

The  Central  African  Republic  is  among  the  poorest  countries  on  the  planet,  with  a  human 

development index estimated at 0.341 in 2013. Poverty affects more than half the population, with 

the corollaries of food insecurity and a lack of basic social services. The Central African economy still 

relies on a primary agricultural sector with low value added and intensive use of poorly qualified and 

essentially  rural  manpower.  To  the  various  internal  constraints  to  the  country's  development, 

including the low level of industrialisation and the land-locked nature of the country, are added the 

ongoing changes in the climate, which are reflected in different impacts: slow and gradual changes in 

the  environment,  variation  in  the  seasons  and  on  occasions  extreme  climate  events  (floods, 

droughts, tropical storms etc.) that may result in natural disasters.  

The annual emissions of the Central African Republic, estimated at 116,285.49 kt eq-CO2 in 2010, or 
26 tons eq-CO2/person, represent less than 0.002% of global emissions. Despite its low rate of GHG 
emissions,  the  Central  African  Republic  reaffirms  its  adherence  to  the  principle  of  collective  but 

differentiated responsibility and, in accordance with Decision 1CP/19, is taking the present ambitious 

measures  to  respond  to  this  challenge  without  impeding  its  economic,  social  and  environmental 

development. 

However,  the vulnerability  to changes  in  the  climate  and  a  lack of  ability  to  adapt  to  their  adverse 

impacts  represent  serious  threats  to  the  management  of  ecosystems  and  other  agricultural  and 

renewable  natural  resources,  social  cohesion,  stability  and  sustainable  development.  Thus,  the 

Central  African  Republic  is  obliged  to  take  into  account  the  adaptation  of  its  land,  its  communities 

and its socioeconomic activities in this effort to contribute to the mitigation of climate change.  The 

         Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Central African Republic -INDC                       4 
 

incorporation of an adaptation component in the INDC is thus a strategic choice that is vital to the 

country. Moreover, not only do most of the adaptation measures, particularly those that help deal 

with  land  use  change  and  reduce  the  fundamentally  non-remunerative  nature  of  agriculture,  also 

contribute  to  mitigation.  However,  the  adaptation  component,  which  concerns  the  poorest,  most 

exposed  and  most  vulnerable  populations,  is  an  occasion  to  promote  throughout  the  national 

territory socioeconomic development on a fair and sustainable basis that can meet the challenges of 

improving access to the country and preventing inter-regional conflicts.  

The Central African Republic's vision is "to become an emerging country, built upon an economy that 

is  diversified,  sustainable  and  uniformly  shared  throughout  the  national  territory,  a  modern  state 

open to the world and committed to an ethic and to technological innovation." The general objectives 

of  the  Central  African  Republic's  INDC  are  focussed  on  sustainable,  low-carbon  development  and 

growing  resilience  of  the  sectors  of  agriculture  and  food  security,  health,  management  of  natural 

resources and infrastructure against the adverse effects of climate change.  

The  process  of  developing  the  INDC  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  literature,  consultation  of  the 

stakeholders  and  the  directives  for  evaluating  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  the  Intergovernmental 

Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC).  At  the  institutional  level,  a  Technical  Group  of  Multi-Sectoral 

National Experts responsible for developing the INDC has been established.

Section 1.  Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions 

General objectives 

The Central African Republic aspires to reduce its emissions by 5% and 25%, respectively, in the 2030 
and  2050  horizons  in  comparison  to  its  reference  BaU  emissions  and  to  increase  its  sequestration 
potential.  With  international  support,  it  will  emit  around  33,076.1  kt  eq-CO2  less  in  2050  than  the 
annual reference emissions. 

The  Central  African  Republic  also  aspires  to  reduce  emissions  of  short-lived  climate  pollutants 
(SLCP), which science has shown have a significant short-term climate-warming potential and harmful 
effects on health, agriculture and ecosystems.  

Reference data

Development, 2013) 

Key  (left  to  right):  INDC  emissions;  INDC  sequestration;  Agriculture;  Other  energy;  Wood  energy;  Waste; 
Industrial processes 

The  reference  data  show  the  inventory  of  greenhouse  gases  in  2010  as  published  in  the  Second 
Communication  of  the  Central  African  Republic.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  total  116,285.49  kt  eq-
CO2  with  sectoral  contributions  of  89.46%  for  land  use  change  and  forestry;  5.26%  for  agriculture; 
5.19%  for  energy  (of  which  4.91%  is  wood  energy);  0.09%  for  waste  and  marginal  amounts  for 
industrial  processes  and  use  of  solvents.  In  addition,  the  sequestration  potential  is  evaluated  at 
330,000 kt eq-CO2,, 62% for land abandoned after use and 38% for biomass. 

Reference scenario 

The assumptions of the reference scenario are based on: 

•  The  success  of  the  Emergency  Programme  for  Sustainable  Recovery  (PURD),  the 
principle  objectives  of  which  are  return  to  constitutional  order,  consolidation  of  the 
peace and security, as well as restructuring of public finances and the primary sector. 
 

•  The resumption of sustained economic growth for the diversification and intensification 
of  economic  activities,  including  increase  of  the  energy  supply  and  updating  of  the 

         Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Central African Republic -INDC                       6 
 

National  Agricultural  Investment  and  Food  Security  and  Nutrition  Programme 
(PNIASAN) and the National Industrialisation Programme.  

 

•  Development of individual, institutional and systemic capacities. 

In  2050,  the  Central  African  Republic  will  emit  around  189,271.8  ±  94,635.4  kt  eq-CO2,  i.e.  62.7% 
more than in 2010, with sectoral contributions of 68.4% for land use change and forestry; 13.4% for 
energy (10.7% of which is for wood energy); 13.4% for agriculture; 3.2% for water; and finally 1.6% for 
industrial processes and use of solvents.

Key: Light blue: Industrial processes-use of solvents (IP-US); Purple: Waste; Olive: Energy; Oragne: Agriculture; 
Green: Land use change and forestry (LUCF) 

Taking  into  consideration  the  net  rate  of  deforestation,  which  is  0.155%  (EDF  2013),  the  country's 
potential for sequestration will be 310,146.43 ± 155,073.222 kt eq-CO2 in 2050, while it was 330,000 kt 
eq-CO2 in 2010, a reduction of 6.02%.  

However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Central  African  Republic's  climate  forecasts,  which  show  an 
increase in rainfall and insolation, are favourable for the appearance of forest re-growth throughout the 
country. This phenomenon will increase the sequestration capacity of the forests.  

Greenhouse gas mitigation measures 

The national contributions consist of:: 

•  Unconditional  measures  within 

initiatives,  namely 

the  ongoing  national 

the 
development  of  industrial  forestry  sites  and  the  national  reforestation  initiated  since 
1980,  the  outreach  programme  to  gradually  abandon  slash-and-burn  agriculture  and 
burning  of agricultural  waste and the promotion of low-energy light bulbs initiated by 
the national  power company  Energie Centrafricaine (ENERCA)  within the framework 
of the energy conservation policy, and the promotion of improved cook stoves. 

                                                      
2  Uncertainties that are foreseen in the quality of the data on the activities of the land use change and 
forestry sector and the use of emission factors conform by default to the 2006 IPCC guidelines.  

         Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Central African Republic -INDC                       7 
 

•  Conditional measures, which will be implemented thanks to international support in 
the  sectors  of  land  use  change  and  forestry  (LUCF),  energy,  agriculture,  industrial 
processes and waste (table 1).

The  implementation  of  the  unconditional  mitigation  measures  will  make  it  possible  to  reduce 
greenhouse gas emission by 4,062 kt eq-CO2 and 10,410 kt eq-CO2, respectively, in 2030 and 2050. 
With the support of the international community, the Central African Republic will reduce 5,500 kt 
eq-CO2 and 47,320 kt eq-CO2, respectively, in 2030 and 2050.

Section 2. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change 

The Central African Republic is at the same time in a post-conflict situation and in political transition, 

which  exposes  it  to  a  considerable  level  of  socioeconomic  vulnerability.  Moreover,  the  entire 

national territory is exposed to extreme climate hazards represented by drought and torrential rains 

followed by floods. The torrential rains and floods affect principally the southern part of the country, 

while drought is more present in the north and northeast. The rural populations that are the poorest 

are  the  ones  that  are  most  exposed.  Thus,  climate  changes  affect  75%  of  the  Central  African 

population. 

In  this  regard,  the  INDC,  by  enhancing  resilience  to  climate  change  in  the  key  sectors,  an  essential 

element  of  sustainable  development,  can  contribute  to  national  cohesion,  stabilisation  of  the 

country,  restoration  of  authority  and  of  government  actions.  In  addition,  it  will  facilitate  a 

programmatic  approach  to  increasing  the  adaptation  capabilities  of  communities,  ecosystems  and 

the activity sectors of agriculture, animal husbandry, forests, health and other sectors vulnerable to 

the adverse impacts of climate change. 

Adaptation options and objectives  

Eight  adaptation  options  have  been  identified  from  the  27  objectives  derived  from  the  national 

priorities. Five ongoing initiatives that enjoy the support of international development partners and 

15 prospective adaptation measures are presented below as preconditions for developing a National 

Adaptation  Plan  that  defines  a  group  of  measures  to  be  taken  at  various  decision-making  levels 

(region, prefecture etc.).  

Adaptation option 1:  Adjustment of the policy framework 

Objective 1. Integrate climate change adaptation measures into the policies and programmes for 
the development of the most vulnerable priority sectors3; 
Objective  2.  Improve  awareness,  education  and  communication  regarding  adaptation  and  the 

risks associated with climate change. 

Adaptation option 2: Improve knowledge about resilience to climate change  

Objective  3.  Enhance  capabilities  for  handling  climate  change  data  at  the  national,  regional  and 

local levels.  

Objective  4.  Study the  resilience  mechanisms  of  the  agricultural,  forestry  and  animal  husbandry 

systems.   

Objective 5. Establish an early warning system.  

                                                      
3 The priority sectors that are most vulnerable to climate change in the Central African Republic are 
agriculture (including animal husbandry, fishing and forests), food security, health, basic infrastructure 
and sustainable management of natural resources.

-   Planning of drinking water supply systems in the Central African Republic. 

 
Probability of co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation measures 
 
We note that all the measures relating to the agriculture and forestry sector can generate mitigation 
co-benefits.  For  example,  the  objective  of  the  National  Programme  for  Investment  in  Agriculture, 
Food Security and Nutrition (PNIASAN) is to attain  and maintain an annual agricultural GDP rate of 
6%  and  a  food  insecurity  rate  of  15%.  It  envisages  the  mobilisation  of  70%  of  the  population  to 
initially enhance 661,826 ha of land, with a planned expansion of 28.6%, reaching 851,750 ha in five 
years.  The  inclusion  of  climate-sensitive  agroecological  approaches  (smart  agriculture)  in  the 
PNIASAN with a view to increasing productivity and yield may make it possible to keep each farmer 
on the same original parcel of land for five years, which will make it possible to minimise or complete 
avoid  increases  in  area  and  thus  capitalise  the  deforestation  (28%)  avoided  over  the  four  years 
following  the  start-up  of  the  project.  To  do  this,  it  is  necessary  to  revise  the  PNIASAN  and 
consequently  increase  its  budget  through  the  contribution  of  the  expected  conditional  funds, 
particularly from the Green Climate Fund.

The  Central  African  Republic  envisages  a  holistic  approach,  integrating  adjustment  of  national 
policies  and  strategies,  improvement  of  the  legislative  and  regulatory  frameworks,  and  capacity 
development and transfer of technology in certain priority areas.  

 Need for technology transfer and capacity development 
The target sectors and technologies are summarised in the following table:

Technology transfer will include a capacity development programme to be adopted at various levels, 

both institutional and local. 

Need for financing 

The needed financing totals US $3.802 billion over the commitment period, i.e. US $2.248 billion to 

implement  the  mitigation  measures  and  US  $1.554  billion  for  the  development  of  resilience  to 

climate change. 

Underestimation  of  the  cost  of  investments  needed  for  adaptation  may  keep  in  place  the 

development gap caused by climate hazards. The approach taken by the FUND model, which will be 

supported by the preparatory work of the National Adaptation Plan, estimates the country's needs 

for adaptation to climate change at an average of around US $34,500,000 per year up to 2030 and an 

average of US $57,500,000 per year up to the year 2050.  

Moreover, the Central African Republic, a non-Annex 1 country, supports the inclusion of international 
market instruments, such as the Clean Development Mechanism, in a post-2020 climate agreement. 
Such an instrument may be used to help finance certain investments in low-carbon infrastructure that 
is resilient to climate change.

Obstacles to be overcome  

For the financial effort expected from the Central African Republic's international partners to be fully 

effective,  the  funds  must  be  effectively  used.  Moreover,  the  following  difficulties  also  have  to  be 

surmounted: 

•  Military and political crises: for the past several decades these have contributed to 
weakening  of  all  of  the  country's  institutions,  political  instability,  insecurity  and  

extreme poverty. The ongoing programme to develop social cohesion and bring the 

country together should make it possible to stabilise the situation. 

•  The  lack  of  synergy  between  sectoral  policies  and  institutions:  this  leads  to 
jurisdictional  conflicts  and  underperformance  and  affects  the  efficiency  of  the 

government.  It  can  delay  the  achievement  of  the  INDC's  objectives.  The  ongoing 

improvement in inter-ministerial coordination should respond to this concern. 

•  The illiteracy rate (estimated at 67% in 2008): this limits access to information and 
to  opportunities,  the  acquisition  of  skills  and,  as  a  consequence,  the  level  of  the 

citizen's contribution to carrying out public policies and meeting the government's 

         Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Central African Republic -INDC                       14 
 

international commitments. Educational programmes are ongoing and basic literacy 

should be improved. 

•  The absence of interregional socioeconomic equality leads to frustration and social 
tensions.  The  government  will  implement  a  decentralisation  programme  that  will 

permit decentralised entities to play a full role. 

•  The  government's  insufficient  capacity  for  investment  does  not  permit  it to  cover 
by  itself  the  costs  of  implementing  the  INDC.  The  actions  and  support  of  the 

development partners and the improvement of the business climate are necessary to 

• 

carry out the Central African Republic's INDC.  

 Poor ability to absorb funds and deal with the lenders' procedures will affect the 

smooth  implementation  of  the  programmes.  The  enhancement  of  individual  and 

institutional  capabilities  will 

improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the 

programmes.  

•  Extreme  poverty:  when  joined  to  the  other  factors  listed  above,  this  has  been  a 
breeding  ground  for  violence  for  several  decades.  The  implementation  of  the 

antipoverty strategy is a specific priority for significantly reducing extreme poverty.  

 

 

Monitoring and notification of progress 
The  Central  African  Republic's  INDC  is  a  development  policy  with  low  carbon  emissions  and  low 

emissions  of  short-lived  climate  pollutants.  In  this  regard,  the  Central  African  Republic  will  put  in 

place  an  appropriate  national  measurement,  notification  and  verification  system.  Moreover,  the 

government  will  organise  regular  consultations  with  the  stakeholders  at  the  national,  regional  and 
local level to both update the actions and make sure that they are carried out.
