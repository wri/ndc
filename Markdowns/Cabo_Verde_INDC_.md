INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED 

CONTRIBUTION OF CABO VERDE 

 

The  "Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution"  (INDC)  of  Cabo  Verde  is  hereby 
submitted jointly by the Ministry of Environmental, Housing and Land Planning and by 
the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  with  a  view  to  contribute  to  the  process  of  the  21st 
Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Paris in December 2015. 

It responds to COP decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20 inviting all Parties to communicate to 
the  secretariat  their  INDCs  so  as  to  achieve  the  objective  set  out  in  Article  2  of  the 
UNFCCC  and  in  a  way  that  demonstrates  a  progression  beyond  their  current 
undertakings.  The  submission  draws  attention  to  the  fact  that  Cabo  Verde  is  a  small 
island  developing  state  (SIDS)  and  that  the  strategies,  plans  and  actions  for  low 
greenhouse  gas  emission  (GHG)  development  put  forward  herein  reflect  the  special 
circumstances  and  adaptation  challenges  of  Cabo  Verde,  which  require  specific 
international  support  in  terms  of  capacity-building,  technology  transfer,  and  financial 
commitments. 

The  preparation  of  this  document  was  coordinated  by  the  National  Directorate  of 
Environment  and  is  structured  as  follows:  (i)  summary  of  contributions;  (ii)  national 
context and overall vision; (iii) mitigation; and (iv) adaptation.  

Cabo  Verde´s  mitigation  contributions  listed  herein  are  expressed  in  the  form  of 
Renewable  Energy  (RE)  and  Energy  Efficiency  (EE)  Targets  and  other  Nationally 
Appropriate  Mitigation  Actions  (NAMAs).  RE  and  EE  Targets  are  proposed  for  both 
2025  and  2030,  along  with  biennial  monitoring  of  progress  based  on  pre-defined 
indicators and supported by GHG inventories.   

Where  expressly  indicated,  the  mitigation  contributions  and  adaptation  measures 
proposed  are  unconditional  unilateral  efforts.  All  other  contributions  proposed  are 
conditional  upon  receipt  of  adequate,  timely  and  predictable  international  support. 
Cabo  Verde  supports  the  use  of  market-based  mechanisms  to  implement  and  achieve 
the conditional portion of the contributions mentioned in this document. 

Finally, Cabo Verde will update, as appropriate, its INDC to account for the most recent 
GHG  inventory  currently  being  prepared  as  part  of  Cabo  Verde´s  Third  National 
Communication process, expected to be concluded in the second half of 2016. 

This  INDC  demonstrates  Cabo  Verde´s  continued  commitment  to  sustainable,  low-
carbon and climate resilient policies and the country´s contribution to global efforts to 
reduce emissions and limit the increase in global average temperatures to 2°C or 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels.

Summary of contributions 

In order to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, this first section presents 
a summary of Cabo Verde's intended mitigation and adaptation contributions.  

Cabo Verde strongly believes that, in light of its national circumstances, in particular its 
position  as  an  arid  small  island  developing  states  (SIDS)  particularly  vulnerable  to 
climate  change,  its  INDC  is  fair,  ambitious,  and  represents  a  genuine  contribution 
towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2.   
    
Table 1- Summary of contributions  
Types of contribution 

 

Both  target  and  action-based  contributions,  tailored  to 
Cabo Verde's special circumstances. Where indicated, the 
mitigation  and  adaptation  measures  proposed  are 
unconditional,  domestically  realised  commitments.  All 
other contributions proposed herein are conditional upon 
receipt of adequate and predictable international support. 

Coverage and scope 

 Specific priorities:  

 

Sectors:  Energy, 
transport,  waste,  AFOLU 
(Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Other  Land  Use),  and 
adaptation. 

  GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH4); and 

nitrous oxide (N2O). 

Time dimension of contributions 

2025 and 2030 

Planning processes 

Cabo  Verde's  planning  process  is  anchored  on  a  wide 
participatory and societal approach and has been shaped 
by a core set of programmatic documents, including:   

  Cabo Verde´s Transformational Agenda for 2030; 
  National Energy Efficiency Plan of 2015 (PNAEE);  
  National  Renewable  Energy  Plan  of  2015 

(PNAER); 

  The  Strategic  Water  and  Sanitation  Plan 

("PLENAS");  

  Growth  and    Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper 

(DCRP III); and 

  Cabo  Verde´s  Low  Carbon  and  Climate  Resilient 

Development Strategy (in preparation).   

Cabo  Verde  is  committed  to  implement  the  Sustainable 
Energy  for  All  (SE4all)  agenda  and  -  as  host  to  the 
ECOWAS  Regional  Centre  for  Renewable  Energy  and 
Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) - intends to assume regional 
leadership on energy transformation in Africa. 

Cabo  Verde  has  recently  signed  together  with  the 
European  Union,  Luxembourg,  Spain,  Portugal  and 
Austria a  Joint  Declaration  on  Reinforced Cooperation  in 
the  Field  of  Sustainable  Energy.  The  cooperation  will 
support  Cabo  Verde  on  its  pathway  to  universal  energy 
access  and  enhanced  electricity  supply  from  100% 
renewable energy sources. 

Cabo  Verde's    national  efforts  and  ambitions  respond  to

the  process  of  the  Durban  Platform  as  well  as  to  the 
Barbados  Programme  of  Action  for  the  Sustainable 
Development  of  SIDS,  the  Samoa  Pathway,  and  the  Post-
2015 Development Agenda. 

As  a  small  island  development  state  (SIDS),  Cabo  Verde 
has one of the lowest GHG emissions per capita and yet is 
among  the  countries  most  vulnerable  to  climate  change. 
In  particular,  Cabo  Verde 
faces  severe  adaptation 
challenges  associated  with  water  resources  availability, 
food and energy security, and desertification processes.  

In  light  of  these  circumstances  and  according  to  the 
country´s  capacities,  Cabo  Verde  believes  its  conditional 
and unconditional contributions to be fair and ambitious, 
effectively  contributing  to  collective  global  efforts  to 
reduce emissions and limit the increase in global average 
temperatures to 2°C or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 

Cabo Verde makes an unconditional commitment:  

* 
* 

to achieve 100% grid access by 2017; and 
to  achieve  a  30%  renewable  energy  penetration 
rate into the electric grid by 2025. 

With international support, Cabo Verde seeks to increase 
the  renewable  energy  uptake  in  electricity  to  100%  by 
2025,  with  best  efforts  to  achieve  this  goal  already  by 
2020, 
indicative 
trajectory: 

in  accordance  with  the 

following 

  35% RE penetration rate in 2016-2018; 
  50% RE penetration rate in 2018-2020; 
  100% RE penetration rate in 2020-2025. 

To  achieve  this  goal,  the  following  key  measures  are 
envisaged: 

 

smart-grid  enhancement  for  the  country's  9 
independent  networks  with  state-of-the-art 
power  conditioning,  production  and  distribution 
control; 

  built-up  of  energy  storage  facilities  (including 

through batteries and flywheels); 
  design of renewable micro-grids; 
  design of individual energy systems (solar home 

 

systems); and 
systematic  deployment  of  solar-water-heaters 
across all islands. 

The  ambitious  renewable  energy  roadmap  will  require 
close  planning  in  public-private  partnerships,  simplified 
procedures  for  licensing  and  certification  ("one-stop-
shops")  and  the  creation  of  robust  competitive  market 
conditions  and  the  consideration  of  specific 
fiscal 
incentives to attract the private sector. 

To reach the above indicative targets, investments in the 
order  of  310  million  EUR  (50%  RE  penetration)  and  1 
billion EUR (100% RE penetration) will be needed. 

Cabo  Verde  estimates  that  the  renewable  energy  target 
will  generate  annual  GHG  emission  reductions  in  the 
range of 600-700 tCO2eq.

Assumptions and methodologies 

 

Cabo  Verde  makes  an  unconditional 
long-term 
commitment to reduce overall energy demand by 10% in 
relation to the Base Scenario by 2030. 

With  international  support,  Cabo  Verde  seeks  to  reduce 
overall  energy  demand  by  20%  in  relation  to  the  Base 
Scenario  by  2030,  with  best  efforts  to  achieve  this 
indicative reduction effort already by 2025.  

To  achieve  these  goals,  the  following  key  measures  are 
envisaged: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking to reduce the proportion of technical and 
non-technical  losses  in  energy  distribution  from 
about  25%  in  2010  to  less  than  8%  by  2030  or 
before; 
improving  energy  efficiency  of  large  consumers, 
with  particular  focus  on  hotels,  hospitals  and 
public  administration  offices  by  2030  or  before, 
including  through  mandatory 
installation  of 
solar-water-heater components; 
achieving  30%  of  efficiency  improvement  in  the 
use  of  electric  power  (15%  residential,  15% 
commercial); 
improving  by  at  least  10%  fuel-usage  across 
sectors and modes of application  (except butane 
usage) by 2030 or before; 
improving  energy  performance  of  the  building 
envelop and implementing a green building code, 
seeking  to  cover  all  new  (public  or  private) 
buildings by 2030 or before; 
enhancing energy efficiency of street lighting and 
creating  energy  rating 
for  domestic; 
appliances  and  air  conditioning  by  2030  or 
before; 
further promoting the use of smaller distributed 
energy  solutions  (e.g.  solar  pumps)  for  water 
pumping, distribution and irrigation; 

labels 

  promoting  the  built-up  of  a  comprehensive 
network  of  energy  services  companies  (ESCOs) 
and clean-energy business incubators. 

The  Base  Scenario  for  the  overall  energy  demand  until 
2030  considered  the  historical  evolution  and  relevant 
variables  associated  with  energy  use,  population  and 
economic  growth.  It  projects  a  moderate  annual  growth 
rate  in  energy  demand  of  around  2%  until  2020, 
increasing to 3% per year from 2020 to 2030.     

The  overall  energy  demand  in  2030  under  the  Base 
Scenario is estimated to be around 2,700GWh.  

The  overall  GHG  reductions  corresponding  to  Cabo 
Verde´s  energy  sector-related  goals  and  other  intended 
mitigation  contributions  will  be  calculated  and  updated 
once the 3rd National Communication and GHG inventory 
is concluded (second half of 2016).

Seek to develop a NAMA that increases energy efficiency 
of  the  transport  sector,  including  domestic  shipping  and 
domestic air travel, and evaluates options for policies and 
actions  available  to  reduce  the  impact  of  GHG  emissions 
originating from this sector.   

The  NAMA  will  initially  be  focused  on  the  collection  of 
relevant data for the sector, including, among others, fuel 
type  and  consumption  per  transport  mode,  technology 
performance, fuel substitution possibilities, estimation of 
costs,  and  an  updated  GHG  emissions  profile  for  light-
duty  vehicles  as  well  as  for  freight  and  passenger 
transportation services.   

This NAMA will also consider options for boosting hybrid 
and  electric  fleet  in  the  country,  in  particular,  the 
feasibility  of  making  government  vehicles  electrically 
powered by 2030. 

Cabo  Verde  makes  an  unconditional 
long-term 
commitment to engage in new afforestation/reforestation 
("A/R")  campaigns  in  the  order  of  10,000  hectares  by 
2030. 

With  international  support,  Cabo  Verde  seeks  an  A/R 
campaign area of around 20,000 hectares until 2030. 

We estimate a planting effort of 400 trees per hectare. If 
20,000  hectares  are  successfully  planted,  this  will 
generate  a  long-term  sequestration  gain  of  360  tCO2eq 
per hectare sequestered after 30 years, corresponding to 
7.2 mtCO2eq for 20,000 hectares after 30 years. 

Cabo  Verde  also aims  at  eliminating  three  stone  cooking 
stove  (35%  of  households  still  use  three-stone  stove) 
through  improved  low-emissions  cookstoves  by  2025  at 
the latest, and thereby substantially removing demand for 
firewood.

is  dependent  on 
international  support  in  the  form  of  technology  support, 
capacity-building,  business  development,  private-sector 
involvement, and international climate finance.  

In  particular,  achieving 
the  energy-related  goals 
communicated  in  this  INDC  will  require  substantial

agenda.  To  the  extent  mentioned  above, Cabo  Verde  will 
seek the support of international climate finance through 
the involvement of both public and private sources.  

Private  and  public  financing  needs  for  implementing  the 
proposed  adaptation  measures  still  need  to  be  assessed 
and determined. 

Several conditional measures envisaged may be financed 
through  mechanisms  and/or  carbon  markets,  including 
the Clean Development Mechanism, new market and non-
market based mechanisms, and credited NAMAs.  

A proper GHG accounting system needs to be established 
to  address  the  risk  of,  and  ultimately  avoid,  double-
counting  of  outcomes,  in  accordance  with  UNFCCC 
guidance and technical specifications.  

II.  National Context and Overall Vision 

Cabo Verde is made up of ten islands and eight islets, located in the Atlantic Ocean, some 
450  km  west  of  Senegal.  It  has  a  land  area  of  4,033  square  kilometres  and  a  700,000 
square  kilometres  Economic  Exclusivity  Zone.  The  10  islands  are  grouped  into 
Windward  islands  (northern  islands  group)  comprising  Santo  Antão,  São  Vicente,  São 
Nicolau,  Santa  Luzia,  Sal,  Boa  Vista,  and  Leeward  islands  (southern  islands  group) 
consisting of Maio, Santiago, Fogo and Brava. Cabo Verde has an estimated population of 
524.832 inhabitants in 2015. 

While  the  country's  contribution  to  global  warming  has  been  negligible,  as  a  small 
island country and a dry Sahelian country with only 10% arable land area, Cabo Verde is 
particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  its  impacts,  ranging  from  extreme 
weather  conditions  to  sea-level  rise  and  the  degradation  of  fish  stocks.  Changes  in 
seasonal, weather and rain patterns are already showing. Along with a depletion of the 
country's  scarce  natural  resources,  climate  variability  in  Cabo  Verde  will  increase 
leading  to  more  storms,  floods  and  droughts,  and  an  ever-shorter  rainy  season.  With 
80% of total population live in coastal areas, Cabo Verde is particularly sensitive to sea-
level rise and coastal hazards.  

Despite  the  challenges,  Cabo  Verde  is  an  emerging  nation  with  a  strong  and 
transformative development agenda. Since achieving independence in 1975, Cabo Verde 
has  evolved  into  a  stable  democracy  and  continuously  growing  economy,  leading  to 
substantial  increases  in  per  capita  income,  widespread  education  and health,  and life-
expectancy, graduating in 2007 from the list of least developed countries. Cabo Verde's 
human  development index (HDI) grew by 11% between  2000 and 2013 and stood, in 
2014, at 0,636. 

Today's economy is mainly shaped by the tertiary sector (almost 70% of GDP), with the 
tourism industry already representing about 30% of GDP. The industry expects robust 
growth  rates,  from  half  a  million  tourists  in  2013  to  one  million  tourists  per  year  by 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
8 | P á g i n a  
 

2020.  While  a  welcome  boost  to  the  economy,  this  development  will  increase  the 
pressure on the country's fragile ecosystem and resources.   

Cabo Verde is firmly committed to a global low-carbon transformation, which decouples 
economic growth from emissions, provides for the sustainable use of natural resources, 
limits average global warming to 2  degrees Celsius, with the ultimate goal of achieving 
1.5  degree  Celsius  in  the  long-term,  and  assists  nations  with  adapting  to  the 
consequences  from  sea-level  rise,  extreme  weather  events,  and  other  effects  of  a 
changing climate. 

At the domestic level, Cabo Verde has laid the relevant groundwork to achieve energy-
independence on 100% renewable sources, integrate highest levels of water-efficiency 
and resilience to climate change, operate a fully sustainable economy and a sustainable 
tourism infrastructure, and work towards building what Cabo Verde has always carried 
in its name: a truly green island state.  

III.  Mitigation 

Energy Sector 

By 2010, the total annual energy use stood at 1,686,2 GWh. Road transport, aviation and 
shipping  (between  islands)  stood  for  most  of  energy  demand,  followed  by  the 
residential,  business  and  tourism  sector,  industries,  and  water  production  (see  Figure 
1).

Figure 1 - Energy consumption per energy subsector in 2010 

 

The entire sector is heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels (petroleum, diesel, gasoline, 
gas  butane,  and  gasoil)  and,  in  the  year  2000,  corresponded  to  around  92.9%  of  the 
CO2e emissions in the country.

However,  Cabo  Verde  is  beginning  to  gradually  increase  the  proportion  of  wind  and 
solar  energy  in  the  energy  mix,  moving  from  1.2%  of  electricity  production  from 
renewable  energy  n  2010  to  about  25%  (representing  35  MW  capacity)  today.  Cabo 
Verde supports and works closely with the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4all) Initiative 
and  -  as  host  to  the  ECOWAS  Regional  Centre  for  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy 
Efficiency (ECREEE) - assumes regional leadership on energy transformation in Africa. 

According  to  Cabo  Verde´s  National  Energy  Efficiency  Plan  (PNAEE),  today's  primary 
energy consumption will grow by about 2% until 2020 and then increase to 3% per year 
from 2020 to 2030 ("Base Scenario").  The overall energy demand in 2030 is estimated 
to be around 2,700 GWh (see Figure 2). 

 

Figure 2 - Estimates of final energy demand under the Base Scenario 

 
We  attempt  to  depart  from  the  Base  Scenario  and  its  GHG  emissions  profile  by 
transforming the electricity sector to rely on  100% renewable sources  until 2025  and 
by reducing overall consumption by 20% until 2030. 

 

 

Proposed measures 

Within  the  context  of  the  domestic  structural  reforms  planned  under  Cabo  Verde's 
Transformational  Agenda,  the  country  aims  to  achieve  a  fully  decarbonized  electricity 
system by 2030, while meeting increased demand (see Figure 3) at affordable prices.

framework 

Cabo Verde unconditionally commits to achieving a electric power penetration  rate of 
30%  by  2025.  Provided  the  necessary  international  technical  and  financial  support  is 
made available (in adequate, timely and predictable manner), Cabo Verde  will increase 
the penetration rate to 100% of the installed electric power from renewables sources by 
2025,  with  best  efforts  to  achieve  this  indicative  goal  already  by  2020.  The  indicative 
implementation  trajectory  is  (i)  35%  RE  penetration  rate  in  2016-2018;  (ii)  50%  RE 
penetration rate in 2018-2020; and (iii) 100% RE penetration rate in 2020-2025.  

Renewable sources will be based mostly on mature technologies, in particular, wind and 
solar,  without  however  ignoring  the  potential  for  geothermal  energy  and  biodiesel  in 
specific areas.

In  addition,  Cabo  Verde  unconditionally  commits  to  achieving  long-term  energy 
efficiency  gains  in  the  order  of  10%  in  relation  to  the  Base  Scenario  by  2030. 
Conditional  on  international  technical  and  financial  support,  Cabo  Verde  will  reduce 
overall  energy  demand  by  20%  in  relation  to  the  Base  Scenario  by  2030,  with  best 
efforts to achieve this indicative reduction effort already by 2025. 

With respect to the goal to achieve the 10% reduction and 20% reduction, respectively, 
in  overall  energy  demand  by  2030,  Cabo  Verde  intends  to  adopt  a  number  of  energy 
efficiency measures in several sub-sectors, including buildings, appliances, large energy 
consumers, fuel use and at household level.  

Figure  4  below  contrasts  energy  demand  under  the  Base  Scenario  with  the  potential 
energy efficient scenario communicated in this INDC. 

 

Figure 4: Energy efficiency target for 2030 (red) compared to the base scenario (blue) 

 
The high ambition of Cabo Verde's goals on renewable energy and energy efficiency will 
require a technology overhaul of the country's energy system, paired with an enabling 
regulatory environment (including the consideration of specific fiscal incentives) that is 
able  to  attract  sufficient  private  sector  interest.  Energy  grid  and  storage  capacity  will 
also  have  to  be  expanded  considerably  and  different  storage  technologies  will  be 
applied in light of the particularities of each island.   
 
Table  3  below  indicates  the  goals  and  actions  proposed  by  Cabo  Verde  in  the  energy 
sector. Monitoring and reporting of Cabo Verde´s performance will be done via Biennial 
Update Reports (BURs) and, in the case of proposed NAMAs, according to the NAMA´s 
own MRV mechanism.

With international support, Cabo Verde seeks to increase the electric 
power  penetration  rate  from  renewable  sources  to  100%  of  the 
installed electric power from renewables sources by 2025, with best 
efforts  to  achieve  this  goal  already  by  2020,  in  accordance  with  the 
following indicative trajectory: 

  35% RE penetration rate in 2016-2018; 
  50% RE penetration rate in 2018-2020; 
  100% RE penetration rate in 2020-2025. 

 
To achieve this goal, the following key measures are envisaged: 

 

smart-grid  enhancement  for  the  country's  9  independent 
networks  with 
conditioning, 
production and distribution control; 

state-of-the-art  power 

  built-up  of  energy  storage  facilities  (including  through 

batteries and flywheels); 

  design of renewable micro-grids; 
  design  of  individual  energy  systems  (solar  home  systems); 

 

and 
systematic  deployment  of  solar-water-heaters  across  all 
islands. 

("one-stop-shops"), 

 
The ambitious renewable energy roadmap will require close planning 
in  public-private  partnerships,  simplified  procedures  for  licensing 
and  certification 
the  creation  of  robust 
competitive  market  conditions,  and  the  consideration  of  specific 
fiscal incentives to attract the private sector. 
 
Seek to reduce overall energy demand by 20% in relation to the Base 
Scenario  by  2030,  with  best  efforts  to  achieve  this  indicative 
reduction effort already by 2025.  
To achieve this goal, the following key measures are envisaged: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus  on  hotels,  hospitals 

seeking  to  reduce  the  proportion  of  technical  and  non-
technical  losses  in  energy  distribution  from  about  25%  in 
2010 to less than 8% by 2030 or before; 
large  consumers,  with 
improving  energy  efficiency  of 
particular 
and  public 
administration  offices  by  2030  or  before,  including  through 
mandatory installation of solar-water-heater components; 
improving  by  at  least  10%  fuel-usage  across  sectors  and 
modes  of  application  (except  butane  usage)  by  2030  or 
before; 
achieving  30%  of  efficiency  improvement  in  the  use  of 
electric power (15% residential, 15% commercial); 
improving  energy  performance  of  the  building  envelop, 
seeking  to  cover  all  new  (public  or  private)  buildings  by 
2030 or before; 
enhancing  energy  efficiency  of  street  lighting  and  creating 
energy  rating 
labels  for  domestic  appliances  and  air 
conditioning by 2030 or before;  
further  promoting  the  use  of  smaller  distributed  energy 
solutions (e.g. solar pumps) for water pumping, distribution 
and irrigation; and 

  promoting  the  built-up  of  a  comprehensive  network  of 
energy  services  companies  (ESCOs)  and  clean-energy 
business incubators. 

Transport-specific NAMA 

 
Seek  to  develop  a  NAMA  that  increases  energy  efficiency  of  the 
transport sector, including domestic shipping and domestic air travel, 
and evaluates options for policies and actions available to reduce the 
impact of GHG emissions originating from this sector.   
 
The NAMA will initially be focused on the collection of relevant data 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

in  the  country, 

for  the  sector,  including,  among  others,  fuel  type  and  consumption 
per  transport  mode,  technology  performance,  fuel  substitution 
possibilities,  estimation  of  costs,  and  an  updated  GHG  emissions 
profile  for  light-duty  vehicles  as  well  as  for  freight  and  passenger 
transportation services.   
 
This NAMA will also consider options for boosting hybrid and electric 
fleet 
in  particular,  the  feasibility  of  making 
government vehicles electrically powered by 2030. 
 
The  Base  Scenario  for  the  overall  energy  demand  until  2030 
considered the historical evolution and relevant variables associated 
with  energy  use,  population  and  economic  growth.  It  projects  a 
moderate annual growth rate in energy demand of around 2% until 
2020, increasing to 3% per year from 2020 to 2030.     
 
The  overall  energy  demand  in  2030  under  the  Base  Scenario  is 
estimated to be around 2,700GWh.  

Base Scenario 
 

 
Forest Sector 

One  of  Cabo  Verde's  highest  economic,  environmental  and  climate  change  related 
priorities  concerns  the  country's  forests.  Forest  vegetation  and  forest  soils  prove  the 
most  effective  means  to  store  and  retain  water,  minerals  and  nutrients.  They  avoid 
erosion,  soil  degradation  and  desertification,  thus  securing  agricultural  land.  They 
provide  biomass  sources;  and  increase  resilience  against  long,  increasingly  often, 
periods  of  drought.  Water  availability  is  approximately  500  m3  a  year  per person,  the 
second lowest of any country in sub-Saharan Africa. 

After  centuries  of  degradation,  Cabo  Verde  has  successfully  engaged  in  reforestation 
and afforestation campaigns since the 1920s. Today's forested area spans some 84,000 
hectares,  roughly  a  fifth  of  the  national  land  territory,  the  vast  majority  of  it  planted 
(with  about  400  trees  per  hectare).  Despite  considerable  planting  activities, 
management  tools  such  as  inventories  and  management  plans  remain  at  an  infancy 
state. 

Degradation, too, continues. About 35% of households - virtually all of them located in 
rural  areas  -  depend  on  firewood  for  cooking  food.  Most  of  the  wood  biomass  - 
according to estimates  some 100 tonnes a year  - originate from forested lands and is 
harvested  with  scarce  regard  to  sustainable  harvesting  methods.  Pressure  from  a 
growing population, unplanned urbanization, and non-sustainable grazing contribute to 
overall degradation. Together with a notable increase in drought years since the 1960s, 
this represents the most single threat to sustainable development in Cabo Verde. 

The  leading  policy  framework  for  Cabo  Verde's  forestry  sector  includes  the  Economic 
Transformation  Strategy  (TEE),  which  proposes,  among  others,  the  sustainable 
management  of  resources  and  the  development  of  agroforestry  and  the  participatory 
management of forest areas, as well as the Strategy Document on Growth and Poverty 
Reduction (Documento de Estratégia de Crescimento e Redução da Pobreza - "DECRP") III 
-  covering  the  years  2011-2016  -  which  argues  for  a  "better  management  of  natural 
resources, including lands, water, fishing and floral resources" and for "economic, social

and physical resilience towards natural disasters and climate change related incidents 
to alleviate the associated risks" and the National Forestry Action Plan (NFAP). 
 
Proposed measures 
Table  4  below  shows  the  goals  and  actions  proposed  by  Cabo  Verde  in  the  forestry 
sector. Monitoring and reporting of Cabo Verde´s performance will be done via Biennial 
Update  Reports  (BURs)  and,  where  appropriate,  make  use  of  CDM  (and  other  widely 
applied) baseline and monitoring methodologies.

Afforestation and  
reforestation 

Proposed measures 
 
Cabo Verde makes an unconditional long-term commitment to engage in 
new  afforestation/reforestation  ("A/R")  campaigns  in  the  order  of 
10,000 hectares until 2030 by 2030; 
 
With international support, Cabo Verde seeks an A/R campaign area of 
around 20,000 hectares until 2030; 
  
Cabo Verde estimates a planting effort of 400 trees per hectare. If 20,000 
hectares  are  successfully  planted,  this  will  generate  a  long-term 
sequestration gain of 360 tCO2eq per hectare sequestered after 30 years, 
corresponding to 7.2 mtCO2eq for 20,000 hectares after 30 years. 
 
Cabo Verde also aims at eliminating three stone cooking stove (35% of 
households still use three-stone stove) through improved low-emissions 
cookstoves  by  2025  at  the  latest,  and  thereby  substantially  removing 
demand for firewood. 

Governance, strategies and  
capacity building  
 

Seek to: 

 

Improve  and  update  of  land  inventory  and  registry  (including 
demarcation services, as appropriate) by implementing: 
- 

a  fully  developed  and  operational  inventory  and  land 
registry 
an area scoping and feasibility analysis; 

- 

  Designate  priority  afforestation/reforestation  areas  based  on 
(including 
vegetation  options, 
concerning  water-retention  needs, 
fire  prevention  and 
restoration  viability),  clear  tenure  rules,  and  management 
agreements with private land holders; 

considerations

  Prepare  a  sustainable  land  management  plan  coupled  with 

performance-based subsidies. 

 

Waste Management Sector 

There  are  few  comprehensive  surveys  on  waste,  waste  management,  and  emissions 
from  waste.  Main  sources  of  wastewater  and  solid  waste  emissions  are  household 
waste,  tourism  induced,  and  agricultural  waste.  According  to  the  Second  National 
Communication,  emissions  from  the  waste  sector  accounted  for  32.4%  of  total  CH4 
emissions in 2000, and solid waste disposal corresponded to 97.0% of that portion. 
Cabo  Verde  solid  waste  management  has  traditionally  been  organized  around  its  22 
municipalities with most of the solid waste - around 113,000 tonnes per year in 2010 - 
still  going  directly  into  open  dumps,  with  the  exception  of  the  city  of  Praia  which 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
15 | P á g i n a  
 

currently operates a sanitary landfill. In addition, while there is potential for capturing 
energy in wastewater treatment plants, the use of sludge for thermal power generation 
purposes remains at concept stage. 
Cabo  Verde  initiated  an  ambitious  governance  reform  process  to  overcome  the 
deficiencies  in  the  sanitation  sector.  The  2010  the  National  Basic  Sanitation  Plan  is 
currently  being  updated  through  the  Waste  Roadmap  for  Cabo  Verde  (Roadmap  de 
Resíduos  de  Cabo  Verde).  It  also  launched  the  National  Strategic  Water  and  Sanitation 
Plan  (Plano  Estratégico  Nacional  de  Água  e  Saneamento    -  "PLENAS")  and  is  currently 
preparing  detailed  water  and  sanitation  master  plans  (Planos  Diretores  de  Água  e 
Saneamento  -  PDAS)  for  each  of  the  islands.  The  reformed  Water  and  Sanitation  Code 
(Código  de  Água  e  Saneamento)  and  the  General  Solid  Waste  Law  are  expected  to  be 
soon enacted. 
 
Proposed measures 
Table 5 below shows the goals and actions proposed by Cabo Verde in the waste sector. 
Monitoring and reporting of Cabo Verde´s performance will be done via Biennial Update 
Reports (BURs) and, where  appropriate, make use of CDM (and other  widely applied) 
baseline and monitoring methodologies.

IV.  Adaptation 

 

Due  to  its  small  insular  and  volcanic  characteristics,  Cabo  Verde  suffers  from  severe 
natural  resources  constraints.  The lack  of  arable  lands  (only  about  10% of  the  land  is 
potentially  arable)  forces  the  country  to  import  between  80%  and  90%  of  its  food 
needs. In addition, the country´s coastal lines are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise 
and  erosion.  Around  80%  of  its  population  is  currently  living  in  these  coastal  areas. 
Cabo  Verde´s  coastal  zones  are  also  crucial  to  foster  and  sustain  the  local  tourism 
industry, the main driving force behind the country´s service-oriented economy.  

Climatic models ran during the NAPA assessment for the period 2008-2012 have shown 
that  the  country´s  natural  vulnerabilities,  along  with  their  social  and  economic 
implications, are very likely to be exacerbated by climate-related disruptions in the next 
decades. These include more frequent extreme events like storms, floods and droughts, 
as well as shorter rainy seasons, with immediate impacts on livelihoods, infrastructure, 
sanitary conditions, recharge of reservoirs, and crop productivity.  

Cabo Verde is affected  by  acute water scarcity (both surface and underground). Mean 
annual  precipitation  levels  are  erratic  and  have  decreased  considerably  since  1970. 
Rainfall  projections  to  2020  reveal  values  below  the  historical  pattern.  As  result,  the 
country has implemented and regularly maintains around 20 highly costly and energy-
intensive water desalination units. Daily water needs of population centres, tourism and 
agriculture is predicted to increase fourfold,  from around  50,000m3 to  160,000m3 by 
2030  and  thus  the  potential  of    various  sustainable  water  supply  and  mobilization 
solutions will need to be better explored going forward.   

Despite  the  existence  of  wastewater  treatment  facilities  in  the  main  urban  areas, 
wastewater  remains  scarcely  managed  across  the  islands  of  Cabo  Verde.    Cabo  Verde 
plans  an  ambitious  operational  overhaul  of  its  sanitation  management  system  to 
overcome infrastructure challenges, in particular, extending the water supply network, 
improving  sewage  collection  and  disposal,  and  properly  harvesting  and  storing 
rainwater/storm water runoffs.  

Adapting its fragile ecosystems to climate change is a key priority for Cabo Verde. Table 
6  below  summarizes  existing  policies  and  actions  to  increase  the  country's  adaptive 
capacity. 

 
Table 6 - Cabo Verde´s existing adaptation policies and actions 

Description 

Existing policies and actions 
 
National  Strategic  Water  and  Sanitation  Plan 
(Plano  Estratégico  Nacional  de  Água  e 
Saneamento - "PLENAS") 
 
  

Through  Resolution  10/2015,  of  February  20th,  Cabo 
Verde  passed  the  PLENAS,  kick-starting  a  water  and 
sanitation  reform  in  the  country.    The  Plan  provides 
strategic  guidance  to  the  different  government  levels 
and a detailed planning process to be carried out in the 
islands.  A  key  strategic  objective  the  PLENAS  is  to 
ensure  that  every  citizen  has  minimum  daily  water 
consumption  level  of  40l  and  a  maximum  of  90l.  The 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
17 | P á g i n a  
 

to 

expansion  in  water  supply  is  to  be  aligned  with 
measures 
improve  overall  sanitation  system, 
optimize  the  use  of  the  resources,  reduce  water 
distribution  losses,  and  promote  rainwater  harvesting 
and water re-use. 
   
With  assistance  from  UNDP  and  GEF,  this  project  aims 
to  create  a  more  systematic  response  to  climate 
disruptions  by  developing  adaptation  policies  and 
measures to better manage climatic vulnerability and by 
implementing targeted demonstration investments. 
 
With  support  from  Japan  International  Cooperation 
Agency  (JICA),  Cabo  Verde  is currently  implementing  a 
project  that  aims  to  meet  water  demand  of  several 
communities  in  the  island  of  Santiago.  The  project 
includes  the  construction  of  wells  and  promoting 
efficiency in water use and allocation. 
 
Within  the  Millennium  Challenge  Account  framework, 
the  WASH  project  seeks  to  improve  water  supply  and 
sanitation  services  to  companies  and  families  in  Cabo 
Verde. 
  
Approved through Resolution 52/100, the Plan seeks to 
set  a  new  path  for  sanitation  in  the  country,  with 
particular  focus  on  improving  institutional  framework 
and basic sanitation infrastructure. 
 
Cabo  Verde  elaborated  its  NAPA  covering  the  period 
2008-2012.  The  NAPA  focuses  on  three  strategic  areas 
for action: (i) water resources; (ii) agriculture practices 
and forestry; (iii) coastal zones and tourism. 

Since  2004  Cabo  Verde  elaborates  and  reassesses 
its  DECRP  containing,  among  other 
periodically 
development  strategies,  actions  to  promote 
food 
security  and  protect  the  environment.  The  DECRP  I 
considered the planning cycle for the period 2008-2013. 
DECRP  II  covers  the  period  2011-2014.  Cabo  Verde  is 
currently implementing the DECRP III. 
 
The  PANA  seeks 
to  mainstream  environmental 
considerations  in  all  the  country´s  relevant  planning 
process.  In  2004  Cabo  Verde  launched  the  PANA  II, 
covering  the  period  from  2004  to  2014. PANA  II  offers 
strategic  guidance  to  address  key  environmental  and 
social  issues  of  Cabo  Verde:  water  scarcity,  loss  of

Following the guidelines established in the PEDA, Cabo 
Verde  launched  the  PADAs  for  the  islands  of  Santiago, 
Fogo, Santo Antão and São Nicolau and set out detailed 
sectoral guidance for local authorities on, among others, 
adaptation-related  actions  for  agriculture  and  fishing 
activities.

Proposed measures 

Based  on  the  analysis  already  carried-out  during  the  NAPA  process,  Cabo  Verde  now 
seeks  international  support  to  further  develop  the  necessary  strategies  and  national 
policies  to  establish  an  integrated  framework  that  increases  the  country's  overall 
adaptive capacity, as well as the level of resilience of those most vulnerable to climatic 
variability and climate change. 

Building on the priorities identified during the development of the NAPA process, Cabo 
Verde proposes to focus its adaptation actions on the following strategic axes:  

  Promoting integrated water resources management, guaranteeing stable and 
adequate  water  supply  (for  consumption,  agriculture,  ecosystems  and 
tourism); 
Increasing adaptive capacities of the agro-silvo-pastoral production systems 
in  order  to  ensure  and  improve  national  food  production,  and  promoting 
Cabo Verde´s blue economy; and 

 

  Protecting and preventing degradation of the coastal zones and their habitat. 

In  addition, Cabo Verde will further expand on measures and actions already initiated 
with  international  support  to  other  areas  of  the  country,  such  as  increasing 
groundwater  reserves  and  land  conservation  practices,  implementing  measures  to 
mitigate  floods  and  intercept  runoff,  and  expanding more-efficient  irrigation  practices 
(e.g.,  drip 
irrigation  monitoring,  and  crop  adaptation 
techniques). 

irrigation,  drainage  and 

Table 7 below identifies the key  adaptation  actions to be implemented by Cabo Verde 
with  a  view  to  achieve  the  above  stated  priorities.  Financing  needs  and  flows  for 
implementing  the  proposed  adaptation  activities  still  need  to  be  assessed  and 
determined.

Proposed measures 

Water and sanitation  
management  

Seek to ensure by 2030: 

 

 

 

 

that  every citizen has safe access to a minimum of 40l potable 
water per day; 
that  all  urban  households  are  connected  to  the  water  supply 
network; 
that  public  sewage  collection  system  and  proper  disposal  is 
extended  to  cover  90%  for  the  cities  of  Praia and  Mindelo  and 
50% of rural areas;   
the  construction  (or  retrofitting/expansion)  of  at  least  4 
wastewater treatment plants and water re-use facilities; 
 

Seek  to  establish  a  systematized  electronic  database  for  storage  and 
management  of  relevant water-related  information,  including a  MRV  to 
assess  water-relevant  data  and  to  better    evaluate  performance  in  the 
sector; 
 
Seek  to  build  several  new  desalination  and  water  pumping  units.  With 
progressive increase of RE penetration in the grid, overall energy costs 
are  expected  to  reduce,  decreasing  also  potable  water  supply  and 
irrigation  costs.  Decentralized  renewable  energy  solutions  and  more

efficient technologies will also be considered and tested by Cabo Verde;     
 
Seek  to  promote  new  water  storage  and  distribution  techniques  and 
build at least 5 new dams by 2030; 
 
Seek to develop water and sanitation master plans ("planos diretores") 
for  each  island  and  encourage  private  sector  participation  through 
different  policy  incentives  and  business  models,  such  as  concessions, 
privatization, leasing, among others, and equitable tariff policies;   
 
Seek  to  increase  urban  resilience  by  developing  master  plans  for 
rainwater  drainage,  improving  and  extending  drainage  infrastructure, 
and implementing flood management systems in vulnerable areas. 
 
Seek to disseminate more efficient small-scale irrigation techniques and 
promote soil conservation schemes for farmers and rural producers; 
 
Seek  to  diversify  income  generating  activities  in  rural  areas  by 
promoting  artisanal  fishing  activities  (providing  training,  equipment, 
micro-credit) in coastal areas; 
 
Seek to promote Cabo Verde´s ocean-based ("blue") economy by, among 
others, supporting new techniques of aquaculture, improving quality of 
fishery products through ecolabelling, and promoting sustainable coastal 
and maritime tourism and sports; 

 

Seek  to  strengthen  governance,  strategy  development  and  capacity 
building by, among others:  

  promoting  workshops  in  order  to  introduce  crop  varieties  and 

 

 

species more adaptable to climatic conditions; 
improving  strategies  associated  with  the  distribution  of  agro-
climatic zones and the structure of crops; and 
improving  data  collection  and  modelling  capacity  associated 
with water and soil management. 
 

 
Seek  to  rehabilitate  or  construct  infrastructures  for  the  protection  of 
coastal zones against seal level rise and beach erosion; 
 
Seek  to  implement  actions  for  the  adaptation  of  fishing  activities  and 
fishing  communities,  building  on  the  scenarios  and  strategies  already 
developed by the Fishery Development National Institute (INDP).
