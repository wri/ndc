Cambodia's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 

 
Introduction 
 
Cambodia recognises the need for respecting the principles of the United Nations Framework 
Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  in  particular  the  principle  of  ‘common  but 
differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  capabilities'  along  with  the  right  to  the 
sustainable development of developing countries.  A global limit of greenhouse gas emissions 
is also needed in order to achieve the ultimate objective of convention, which is "to stabilise 
greenhouse  gas  concentrations  in  the  atmosphere  at  a  level  that  would  prevent  dangerous 
anthropogenic  interference  with  the  climate  system".  In  response  to  the  ‘Lima  Call  for 
Action'1,  Cambodia  is  pleased  to  present  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution 
(INDC) to the UNFCCC, ahead of COP 21 in Paris, December 2015. This INDC is subject to 
revisions  to  meet  national  circumstances  as  the  country  continues  along  its  development 
pathway. 
 
Cambodia  is  a  low  emitter  and  highly  vulnerable  country  to  the  negative  effects  of  climate 
change.  Our  contribution  is  therefore  necessarily  aligned  with  our  development  priorities. 
The INDC includes both adaptation and mitigation actions based on national circumstances. 
Cambodia's INDC is composed of five sections: 
 

*  Section 1: National context, presenting national circumstances relevant to the INDC 
*  Section  2:  Adaptation,  covering  Cambodia's  vulnerability  to  climate  change  and 

prioritised adaptation actions 

*  Section  3:  Mitigation,  including  Cambodia's  intended  contribution  to  reduce 
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  with  information  to  ensure  clarity,  transparency  and 
understanding, and consideration of fairness and ambition 

*  Section 4: Planning and implementation processes, with indications of the institutions, 

policies, strategies, and plans that will support the implementation of the INDC  

*  Section 5: Means of implementation, with information on the support needed for the 

implementation of the INDC.

Cambodia  is  confident  that  through  INDCs,  which  is  a  new,  ‘bottom-up'  approach  to 
addressing  climate  change,  the  impasse  in  the  negotiations  that  have  been  experienced  in  the 
past  years  will  be  overcome.  Cambodia  also  hopes  that  the  new  agreement  to  be  finalised  at 
COP  21  will  be  successful  in  limiting  temperatures  to  a  level  that  would  prevent  dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the global climate system, and at the same time contribute to 
global poverty reduction and promote economic growth efforts. 

National Context 

 
1. 
 
Cambodia  is  highly  vulnerable  to  the  effects  of  climate  change,  in  particular  from  floods, 
droughts,  windstorms,  and  seawater  intrusion.  Agriculture,infrastructure,  forestry,  human 
health,  and  coastal  zones  are  the  most  affected  sectors.  Cambodia's  main  national 
development  priority,  enshrined  in  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP)  for 
2014-2018, is to reduce poverty while fostering economic growth at a steady rate of 7-8% per 
year2. Cambodia aims to  progress  from least-developed country (LDC) status towards a low 
and high middle-income developing country by 2018 and 2030 respectively. It is intended that 
this  goal  will  be  achieved  by  diversifying  the  economy,  including  through  industrialisation 
and the development of physical infrastructure. 
 
Efforts  in  addressing  climate  change  in  Cambodia  cannot  be  separated  from  economic 
development  and  poverty  alleviation  goals.  The  agriculture  sector  is  expected  to  grow  at  an 
annual rate of 5% in order to meet national economic growth and export targets, as well as to 
contribute to the population's food security needs. At the same time, Cambodia has more than 
57%  forest  cover,  which  the  government  endeavours  to  increase  and  maintain,  to  ensure 
livelihoods  for  forest-dependent  communities  and  future  generations.  The  pressure  on 
resources  and  land  is  high,  and  whilst  the  latest  available  GHG  inventory  suggests  that 
Cambodia was an overall net carbon sink in 20003. 
 
Despite the many challenges inherent in realising such strong ambitions, Cambodia is proud 
of  the  progress  made  in  climate  change  policy,  in  particular  since  the  accession  to  the 
UNFCCC  in  1996.  Explicit  efforts  have  been  made  in  mainstreaming  climate  change  into 
national and sub-national planning. For example, Cambodia has developed and implemented 
the  Climate  Change  Strategic  Plan  2014  -  2023  (CCCSP),  and  associated  action  plans 
developed  by  each  relevant  ministry.  These  plans  are  Cambodia's  first  ever  comprehensive 
national policy documents that illustrate not only the country's priority adaptation needs, but 
also provide roadmaps for the de-carbonisation of key economic sectors and the enhancement 
of  carbon  sinks.  Further,  Cambodia  has  developed  a  Green  Growth  Policy  and  Roadmap

Adaptation 

which  sets  the  path  to  stimulating  the  economy  through  low  carbon  options,  savings  and 
creating jobs, protecting vulnerable groups, and improving environmental sustainability. 
 
Cambodia  has  also  made  progress  in  integrating  climate  change  in  budgeting  through  the 
development  of  a  climate  change  financing  framework,  in  addition  to  producing  regular 
climate  public  expenditure  reviews  and  having  improved  tracking  of  climate  finance  in  the 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) database. There is ongoing work in priority sectors 
to strengthen climate change-related budget submissions and in integrating climate change in 
their monitoring and evaluation systems. Climate finance modules are also being integrated in 
the public financial management training courses provided for government officials.

2.1.  Vulnerability to Climate Change 
 
Cambodia is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world4. As a least developed, 
agrarian country, Cambodia's vulnerability to climate change is mainly due to its geography, 
high reliance on the agriculture sector, and low adaptive capacity, including limited financial, 
technical and human resources. Over the past decade, Cambodia has witnessed more frequent 
and severe floods, droughts and windstorms which pose serious challenges to socio-economic 
development. As well as occurring more frequently, storms have resulted in increasingly high 
physical and economic impacts, in particular in rural areas. As an example, heavy rainfall in 
October 2013 resulted in flash floods, impacting over half a million people. More than half of 
Cambodia's provinces were impacted, with the Mekong region being particularly affected, as 
the  river's  water  levels  rose  with  the  rainfall.  An  assessment  indicated  that  the  damage  and 
loss  caused  by  the  2013  floods  was  356  million  US$5,  of  which  153  million  US$  was  the 
estimated value of the destruction of physical assets (damage) in the affected areas, and 203 
million  US$  the  estimated  losses  in  production  and  economic  flows.  Similarly,  in  2012, 
drought was experienced by 11 out of the 24 provinces in Cambodia and negatively affected 
tens of thousands of hectares of rice growing areas. 
 
Meteorological modelling predicts that temperatures will rise in the future and, in addition to 
the  increased  frequency  of  severe  floods  experienced  over  the  last  decade,  rainfall  patterns 
will become more unpredictable by 2050. Agriculture, infrastructure, forestry, human health, 
and coastal zones are the most vulnerable sectors to the impacts of climate change: 
 

-  Agriculture:  The  country's  most  agricultural  production  system  is  dependent  either 
on rainfall or on the annual flooding and recession of the Tonle Sap Great Lake. The 
sector  is  therefore  particularly  sensitive  to  potential  changes  in  local  climate  and 
monsoon regimes

- 

Infrastructure:  the  increasing  occurrence  and  severity  of  floods  exacerbated  by 
climate change are resulting in high costs for the maintenance and upgrading of roads 
and  irrigation  infrastructure.  This  is  particularly  the  case  in  urban  areas  where  more 
and more assets and population are concentrated 

-  Forestry: Under emission scenarios SRESB1 and SRESA2 up to 2050 most lowland 
forest  will be exposed to a longer dry  period, particularly  forest  areas located in  the 
northeast  and  southwest.    More  than  4  million  hectares  of  lowland  forest,  which 
currently has a water deficit period of between 4 and 6 months, will become exposed 
to a greater water deficit period of between 6 to 8 months or more  

-  Human health: Climate change can have both direct and indirect impacts.  Examples 
of direct impacts include death, injury, psychological disorders and damage to public 
health 
the 
geographical range and incidence of vector-borne diseases, water-borne and infectious 
diseases, malnutrition and hunger as a result of ecosystem disturbance 

infrastructure.  Examples  of 

impacts 

indirect 

include  changes 

in 

-  Coastal zones: Coastal zone resources already face a number of pressures, including 
from  over-fishing,  over-exploitation  of  forest  resources  and  mangrove  ecosystems 
leading to increased erosion. Climate change adds to these existing challenges through 
sea level rise, shrinking arable land and decreasing availability of drinking water.  
  
Priority Actions  

2.2 
 
Adapting  to  current  and  future  effects  of  climate  change  is  a  priority  for  Cambodia. 
Cambodia firmly believes that climate change adaptation action requires an integrated, multi-
sector approach to be effective and to be able to support national development objectives.  
Cambodia has therefore selected a number of priority actions, giving prominence to ones with 
climate change impact mitigation co-benefits, as follows: 
 

-  Promoting  and  improving  the  adaptive  capacity  of  communities,  especially  through 
community  based  adaptation  actions,    and  restoring  the  natural  ecology  system  to 
respond to climate change  
Implementing management measures  for  protected  areas to adapt to climate change 

- 
-  Strengthening early warning systems and climate information dissemination 
-  Developing  and  rehabilitating  the  flood  protection  dykes  for  agricultural  and  urban 

- 

development 
Increasing  the use of  mobile pumping stations and permanent  stations in  responding 
to  mini-droughts,  and  promoting  groundwater  research  in  response  to  drought  and 
climate risk 

-  Developing  climate-proof  agriculture  systems  for  adapting  to  changes  in  water 

variability to enhance crop yields.  

-  Promoting climate resilient agriculture in coastal areas through building sea dykes and 

scaling-up of climate-smart farming systems  

 

 
 

-  Developing  crop  varieties  suitable  to  Agro-Ecological  Zones  (AEZ)  and  resilient  to 

climate change  

-  Promoting aquaculture production systems  and practices that are adaptive to  climate 

change 

-  Repairing  and  rehabilitating  existing  road  infrastructure  and  ensuring  effective 

operation and maintenance, taking into account climate change impacts 

-  Up-scaling the Malaria Control Program towards pre-elimination status of malaria  
-  Up-scaling of national programmes to address the risk of acute respiratory infection, 
diarrhoeal  disease  and  cholera  in  disaster-prone  areas.  Including  conducting 
surveillance  and  research  on  water-borne  and  food-borne  diseases  associated  with 
climate change 

-  Strengthening  technical  and  institutional  capacity  to  conduct  climate  change  impact 
assessments,  climate  change  projections,  and  mainstreaming  of  climate  change  into 
sector and sub-sector development plans. 
 

Mitigation 

The  implementation  of  each  of  the  above  actions  and  the  context  in  current  climate  change 
strategies are presented in Table 1 in the Annex.  
  
2. 
 
3.1 
 
Cambodia's contribution particularly aligns with the following requirement of the Lima Call 
for Action, paragraph 11:   

Contribution 

-  "…the 

least  developed  countries  and  small 

island  developing  States  may 
communicate  information  on  strategies,  plans  and  actions  for  low  greenhouse  gas 
emission development reflecting their special circumstances in the context of intended 
nationally determined contributions…"  

Cambodia  wishes  to  propose  a  GHG  mitigation  contribution  for  the  period  2020  -  2030, 
conditional upon the availability of support from the international community, in particular in 
accordance with Article 4.3 of the UNFCCC. Significantly, despite Cambodia's status as an 
LDC,  Cambodia  is  implementing  actions  in  accordance  with  our  sustainable  development 
needs that also address climate change:   

(i) 

(ii) 

Energy  industries,  manufacturing  industries,  transport,  and  other  sectors: 
Cambodia intends to undertake actions as listed in Table 1, the impact of which is 
expected  to  be  a  maximum  reduction  of  3,100  Gg  CO2eq  compared  to  baseline 
emissions of 11,600 Gg CO2eq by 2030. 
LULUCF:  Cambodia  intends  to  undertake  voluntary  and  conditional  actions  to 
achieve the target of increasing forest cover to 60% of national land area by 2030. 
In  absence  of  any  actions  the  net  sequestration  from  LULUCF  is  expected  to 

 

 
 

reduce  to  7,897  GgCO2  in  2030  compared  to  projected  sequestration  of  18,492 
GgCO2 in 20106.  

Tables  1  and  2  detail  the  potential  mitigation  reduction  in  these  sectors,  along  with  the 
necessary corresponding actions to realise the mitigation potential identified.

GHGs  and  removals  of  CO2  are  based  on  data  reported  in  the  draft 
Second  National  Communication 
the 
Government  of  Cambodia.  The  GHG  inventory  used  Tier  1 
methodologies  set  out  in  the  IPCC  1996  Guidelines,  IPCC  default 
emission factors and country specific activity data from 2000. 
 
Baseline  GHG  projections:  In  the  energy  sector,  projections  have 
been  generated  for  the  SNC  using  Long-range  Energy  Alternatives 
Planning  (LEAP)  modelling,  using  default  emission  factors  and 
activity  data  from  a  wide  range  of  sources.  Projections  for  the  land 
use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector take into account 
forest  and  grassland  conversions  and  land  abandonment,  and  are 
based  on  methodologies  in  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate 
Change  (IPCC)  Good  Practice  Guidance.  All  projections  took  into 
account current macroeconomic conditions, policy conditions, market 
conditions and events in other sectors. 
 
Mitigation options: These were formulated based on previous needs 
analyses,  experience  from  successful  projects,  pilot  projects, 
feasibility studies, literature reviews and expert opinion.

Fairness and Ambition 

 
3.3 
 
Cambodia  recognises  the  need  for  all  countries  to  present  fair  and  ambitious  INDCs,  and 
acknowledges the objectives laid out in the Lima Call for Action.  
 
As  an  LDC,  Cambodia  emits  a  small  share  of  present  global  emissions  and  accounts  for  a 
fraction of past global emissions. Taking into account the important role of forestry in carbon 
capture,  Cambodia  was  still  a  net  sink  in  the  year  2000.  As  per  estimates  in  draft  SNC, 
Cambodia's BAU per capita emissions in 2050 will be 2.59 tCO2eq, this is less than half of 
current  world  per  capita  emission.  The  actions  proposed,  if  adequately  supported  through 
finance, technology transfer, and capacity building, will keep the per capita emissions to  an 
estimated 2.04 tCO2eq by 2030 which is below world average for a 2oC pathway.  
Cambodia,  despite  being  an  LDC,  has  for  the  first  time  presented  a  clear  list  of  mitigation 
actions  to  limit  growth  in  GHG  emissions,  making  a  significant  deviation  from  BAU,  and 
thus going beyond existing actions.  
 
Cambodia  seeks  to  maximise  synergies  between  mitigation  and  adaptation,  and  sustainable 
development.  Hence,  the  actions  proposed  are  necessarily  integrated  with  Cambodia's 
development priorities, whilst ensuring that growth shifts towards a low carbon development 
pathway, and align with efforts to increase our country's resilience. 
 
4. 
 
The INDC has been developed under the coordination of the National Council for Sustainable 
Development.  An  INDC  Preparation  Team  has  been  appointed,  with  representatives  from 
relevant  ministries  that  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  specific  actions 
identified.   
 
This  INDC  (and  its  future  revisions)  are  to  be  an  integral  part  of  the  climate  change 
architecture of Cambodia. Hence its implementation will be aligned with that of Cambodia's 
national climate change policy, and not create unnecessary duplication. 

Planning and Implementation Processes 

 

 
 

There  are  a  number  of  existing  and  planned  domestic  processes  for  delivering,  supporting, 
and  monitoring  climate  change  policy  in  Cambodia,  thereby  facilitating  the  successful 
implementation of the actions captured in the INDC. It is clear that these strategies and plans 
will  need  to  be  revised  once  the  timeframes  expire,  after  having  assessed  the  progress 
achieved under them.  
 
Cambodia made extensive progress in developing processes for implementing climate change 
interventions  over  the  last  decade.  The  overarching  development  plan  for  the  country,  the 
National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (2014-2018),  states  the  importance  of  implementing 
Cambodia's  Climate  Change  Strategic  Plan  (2014-2023)  and  contains  indicators  to  track 
implementation  of  climate  change  actions.  Further,  the  INDC  development  is  guided  by 
theGreen  Growth  Road  Map  (2009),  developed  with  the  aim  to  support the  achievement  of 
middle-income country status by 2030. The roadmap also has priority projects for the longer 
term i.e. 2020-2030. 
 
Cambodia  intends  to  support  the  initial  delivery  of  the  INDC  mainly  through  the 
implementation  of  the  Cambodia  Climate  Change  Strategic  Plan  (CCCSP)  (2014  -  2023). 
The  following  strategic  priorities  aim  to  develop  Cambodia  towards  a  green,  low-carbon, 
climate-resilient, equitable, sustainable and knowledge-based society:   
(1) 
The  line  ministries  have  developed  Sectoral  Climate  Change  Strategic  Plans  and 
Action Plans (SCCSPs and SCCAPs) are aligned with CCCSP and cover all the main sectors 
of relevance to climate change, where identified in the NAPA and National Communications 
under the UNFCCC. Cambodia is also actively mainstreaming climate change resilience into 
sub-national planning and finance systems. 
 
(2) 
Specifically  on  adaptation,  Cambodia  has  undertaken  initiatives  to  mainstream 
adaptation  into  national  development,  and  in  specific  sectors  such  as  in  the  agriculture, 
forestry  and  human  health  sectors,  as  well  as  coastal  zone  management.  In  addition  to  the 
CCSP  and  the  SCCSPs  and  SCCAPs,  Cambodia  has  developed  the  National  Adaptation 
Programme of Action to Climate Change (2006), in which coping mechanisms to hazards and 
climate change impacts are identified, as well as key adaptation needs. 
 
(3) 
The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process is being used in Cambodia to strengthen 
the  ongoing  climate  change  adaptation  processes  through  cross-sectoral  programming  and 
implementation  at  national  and  sub-national  levels.  It  may  in  turn  inform  future  climate 
change strategies, financing frameworks, and national development planning and budgeting. 
 
(4) 
Forestry  related  actions  would  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  national  REDD+ 
Strategy.  Cambodia  is  developing  an  operational  National  Forest  Monitoring  System 
(NFMS), Reference Emission Level to more accurately quantify GHG impacts of actions in 
this sector. This will form the basis of implementing and accounting for the forestry actions 
post  2020.  Further,  Forest  Reference  Emission  Levels  and  Forest  Reference  Levels 

 

 
 

(FREL/FRL)  and  a  Safeguards  Information  System  (SIS)  will  be  used  to  account  for  the 
emissions reduced via the implementation of activities identified from 2016-2020. 

 

Means of Implementation 

 
Cambodia has already taken steps to ensure that its monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system 
includes indicators to measure progress, including INDC implementation, both for adaptation 
and  mitigation.  The  monitoring,  reporting  and  verification  (MRV)  system  will  build  on  the 
greenhouse  gas  inventory.  In  particular,  continued  support  to  develop  the  REDD+  MRV 
system is required, in order to enable Cambodia to move towards the third phase of REDD+ 
where it will receive performance-based payments. M&E for adaptation is  currently  carried 
out  at  project-level.  A  national  M&E  framework  will  be  developed,  while  activities  to 
operationalise it in key sectors have already begun. 
 
The Annex to this INDC summarises the prioritised actions on climate change mitigation and 
adaptation,  and  the  proposed  related  planning  and  implementation  processes.  It  is  expected 
that there will be stock-taking of progress and lessons learned in 2018 for the development of 
the action plans for the subsequent period.

Cambodia  requires  support  in  the  form  of  financing,  capacity  building,  and  technology 
transfer  to  implement  the  actions  set  out  in  this  INDC.  Detailed  analysis  at  the  start  of  the 
INDC implementation  will  be necessary  in  order to  align it  with  that of the  climate change 
action plans and refine the estimation of funding requirements, in particular post 2018. This 
analysis  will  determine  the  precise  nature  and  level  of  support  needed,  in  particular  with 
respect to capacity building and technology transfer. 
 
The assessment of support needs will build on the  climate change financing framework that 
has  been  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  climate  change  action  plans.  This  framework 
included an analysis of financing sources, costing, analysis of climate change impacts on the 
economy,  and  recommendations  on  financing  modalities  for  the  implementation  of  the 
CCCSP.  
 
According to the assessment of financial needs for priority activities up to 2018 included in 
the sectoral climate change action plans, Cambodia would require 1.27 billion US$ to support 
the  implementation  of  these  activities.  The  assessment  also  took  into  account  the  climate 
finance  absorption  capacity  of  Cambodia  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  investments  are 
effective.  
The international finance support needed would be additional to what Cambodia is allocating 
to  implement  its  sustainable  development  plans  to  realise  the  identified  positive  impacts  of 
GHG emission reduction activities. The Climate Change Financing Framework estimated that 
in  2012,  expenditure  on  climate  related  policies  and  actions  represented  6.5%  of  public 
expenditure, or 1.31% of national GDP. In the National Strategic Development Plan there is a 

 

 
 

plan to increase the ratio of climate expenditure on GDP from an estimated 1.39% in 2015 to 
1.5% in 2018.  
 
The  support  received  will  be  channelled  through  bilateral  and  multilateral  mechanisms, 
including market based mechanisms. Cambodia is for example making progress in readiness 
for direct access to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which may become the principal vehicle 
for  climate  finance  in  the  future.  Dedicated  climate  change  funding  from  international 
sources, either from bilateral/multilateral donors or through global climate funds, represents 
only  40%  of  total  climate  related  investment.  The  strategy  will  also  focus  on  traditional 
development  funds,  as  the  climate-relevant  portion  of  these  funds  from  domestic  and 
international  sources  too  are  an  important  financing  support.  As  stated  above  Cambodia  is 
already participating in REDD+ mechanism with respect to forestry related actions.   
 
Sectoral climate change action plans contain indications of capacity building needs. Through 
consultations carried out to develop the INDC, the development of MRV and M&E systems 
has  been  identified  as  a  priority.  Though,  as  explained  above  the  work  has  already  been 
initiated, more work is needed to develop the MRV based on identified indicators.  
 
Cambodia  has  developed  technology  needs  assessment  for  adaptation  and  mitigation,  and 
technology needs also feature prominently in the sectoral climate change action plans. At the 
start  of  the  INDC  implementation  phase  Cambodia  will  also  need  to  carry  out  a  detailed 
technology needs assessment.  
 
 

 

 
 

Annex: Further Information Related to Climate Change Related Strategies and Policies 
 
Cambodia  intends  to  support  the  initial  delivery  of  the  INDC  mainly  through  the 
implementation of the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan (CCCSP) (2014 - 2023) (see 
table  1  below)  through  the  following  strategic  priorities  aims  to  develop  towards  a  green, 
low-carbon, climate-resilient, equitable, sustainable and knowledge-based society.   
The main CCCSP strategic objectives are to: 
 

-  Promote climate resilience through improving food, water and energy security 
-  Reduce  sectoral,  regional,  gender  vulnerability  and  health  risks  to  climate  change 

impacts 

-  Ensure  climate  resilience  of  critical  ecosystems  (Tonle  Sap  Lake,  Mekong  River, 
coastal ecosystems, highlands, etc.), biodiversity, protected areas and cultural heritage 
sites 

-  Promote low-carbon planning and technologies to support sustainable development 
-  Improve capacities, knowledge and awareness for climate change responses 
-  Promote adaptive social protection and participatory approaches in reducing loss and 

damage due to climate change 

-  Strengthen  institutions  and  coordination  frameworks  for  national  climate  change 

responses 

-  Strengthen  collaboration  and  active  participation  in  regional  and  global  climate 

change processes. 
 

The CCCSP sets out strategies and actions for different phases:   

-  In  the  immediate  term  (2013-2014):  putting  in  place  institutional  and  financial 
arrangements  for  the  implementation  of  the  CCCSP,  development  of  national 
monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  frameworks  and  indicators,  and  development  of 
climate change action plans (2014 - 2018) by line ministries 

-  In the medium term (2013-2018): launch of high priority programmes with an initial 
focus  on  adaptation  and  gradual  increase  in  mitigation  actions,  and  accreditation  of 
the Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund 

-  In the long term (2019-2023): the focus will be on research and learning, but its main 
objective  will  be  to  scale  up  successful  initiatives  and  to  continue  mainstreaming 
climate change into national and sub-national programmes. 

 
Table  A1  provides  a  comprehensive  list  of  climate  change  related  strategies  and  policies 
under the CCCSP.
