<meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8'>INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (INDC)  

OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF DOMINICA 

Communicated to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 

(UNFCCC) on the 30thSeptember, 2015 

 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 

 

 
The Commonwealth of Dominica is committed to the successful conclusion of negotiations under the Ad-
Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) in order to adopt, at the 21st 
meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris, a new legally-binding agreement under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) appropriate and fair to all Parties, which 
will  come  into  effect  and  be  implemented  from  2020  onwards.  Dominica  hereby  communicates  its 
Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (INDC),  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  paragraphs  of 
Decisions  1/CP.19  and  1/CP.20,  towards  achieving  the  ultimate  objective  of  the  Article  2  of  the 
Convention,  which  provides  up-front  information  to  facilitate  the  clarity,  transparency  and  the 
understanding  of the  INDC.  Dominica is  also  pleased  to  provide  additional  accompanying  information 
relating to mitigation, adaptation planning/management and support for implementation. 
 
 
Dominica  as  a  small  island  developing  State  is  vulnerable  to current  and  ongoing  impacts  from  climate 
 
change. Facing ever escalating social, environmental and economic costs from such impacts, the priority of 
the Government of Dominica is to implement the comprehensive Strategic Program for Climate Resilience 
 
contained  in  the  Dominica  Low  Carbon  Climate  Resilient  Strategy  (2012).  For  Dominica,  there  is  little 
distinction between adaptation and mitigation measures - an integrated response is being implemented to 
 
build climate resilience in vulnerable communities, while enabling Green Growth through the transition to 
sustainable  energy  technologies.  Recognising  Dominica's  common  but  differentiated  responsibility  and 
 
limited  capabilities  to  address  climate  change,  Dominica  commits  to  progressively  reduce  total  gross 
 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 2014 levels (164.5 Ggs est.) at the following reduction rates: 
 
 
 
By 2030, total emission reductions per sector will be as follows: 
•  Energy industries - 98.6% (principally from harnessing of geothermal resources); 
 
•  Transport - 16.9%; 
 
•  Manufacturing and construction - 8.8%; 
•  Commercial/institutional, residential, agriculture, forestry, fishing - 8.1%; 
•  Solid waste - 78.6%. 
 
Benefiting  from  sound  management  practices,  Dominica  forests  will  continue  to  sequester  100  Ggs  of 
national GHG emissions on an annual basis during the period 2020 to 2030. The commercial development 
and continued harnessing of Dominica's geothermal resources will, from 2025 onwards, enable the country 
to export significant amounts of renewable energy (estimated to exceed 200 Ggs annually) to the nearby 
French  Territories  of  Martinique  and  Guadeloupe,  thereby  contributing  to  global  efforts  to  reduce  GHG 
emissions. 
 
This contribution is conditional upon receiving timely access to international climate change financing, 
technology  development  and  transfer,  and  capacity  building  support  for  priority  adaptation  and 
mitigation measures. Dominica's INDC will remain provisional pending confirmation of timely access to 
international climate change financing, technology development and transfer, and capacity building support 
for priority adaptation and mitigation measures detailed in this INDC. Dependent upon COP21 outcomes, 
Dominica reserves the right to revise the INDC.  
 

17.9% by 2020; 39.2% by 2025;    and 44.7% by 2030. 
 

´Flood swamped villages, destroyed homes and wiped out roads. Some communities are no longer recognizable…´ 
´The extent of the devastation is monumental. We have in essence to rebuild the country.´ Prime Minister, Hon. 
Roosevelt Skerrit, describing the situation in Dominica in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Erika which left many 
people dead and injured, over 500 persons homeless, and devastated the country on the morning of 27th August, 
2015, resulting in US$392.3 million in damages (representing 75.88% of GDP). 

Country Context 
Dominica has always been in a vulnerable position economically, socially, culturally, and environmentally 
given  its  susceptibility  to  natural  disasters  and  its  ecological  and  economic  fragility.  Vulnerability  to 
climate change in Dominica, like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), is aggravated by external 
pressures  affecting  its resilience  and  adaptive  capacity  such  as  terms  of trade, impacts  of  globalisation 
(both positive and negative), financial crises, international conflicts, external debt, externalization of the 
benefits of foreign direct investment at the expense of the local population, and internal local conditions 
such as population growth, reliance of fossil fuel imports, incidence of poverty, inadequate social capital, 
unemployment, limited resource base for economic development, reduced social cohesion, and a widening 
gap between poor and rich, together with the interactions between them. It is widely acknowledged that 
climate  change  exacerbates  impacts  from  natural  disasters  with  enormous  human,  environmental  and 
economic costs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recognising the threats posed by climate change, Dominica has, over the last two decades, undertaken a 
number of initiatives to respond to this threat. Dominica has established a strong track record on climate 
change adaptation, and in this regards was one of the first countries in the Caribbean region to adopt a 
National Climate Change Adaptation Policy (2002). Dominica was one of the few countries chosen to 
pilot adaptation measures under the Special Program on Adaptation to Climate Change (SPACC), and 
pioneer  the  development  of  a  strategic  programmatic  approach to  building  climate  resilience  under  the 
Pilot  Program  on  Climate  Resilience  (PPCR).  In  2012,  the  Cabinet-approved  Dominica  Low  Carbon 
Climate Resilient Strategy was developed through broad-based stakeholder engagement and input, with 
support  provided  by  the  Climate  Investment  Funds  (CIF).  Additionally,  as  a  collaborative  initiative 
between  the  SPACC  program  and  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  funded  Sustainable  Land 
Management  (SLM)  project,  Dominica  has  pioneered:  (a)  the  vulnerability  mapping  and  "climate 
proofing" of National Parks Management Plans; and (b) community-based vulnerability mapping and the 
development, through community engagement and input, of community adaptation plans. Methodologies 
for  adaptation  planning  and  management  developed  by  Dominica  under  these  programs  have  been 
promoted as models of best practices by a number of international agencies. 
 
In  the  global  context,  until  around  2005Dominica´s  contribution to  global greenhouse  gas  emissions 
was nil, due to the small size of the country's economy and population, combined with the ability of the 
large  expanse  of  the  country's  forested  areas  (comprising  63%  of  the  total  land  area)  to  sequester 
greenhouse  gases  at  levels  that  exceeded  national  GHG  emissions  from  anthropogenic  activities. 
Nonetheless,  Dominica  is  a  country  committed  nationally  and  internationally  to  addressing  climate 
change.  Due  to  the  exceptionally  high  level  of  vulnerability  to  climate  impacts,  Dominica´s  national 
priority  is  to  enhance  community,  ecosystem  and  national  resilience  to  climate  change  and  natural 
disasters,  including  through  the  implementation  of  viable  sustainable  energy  and  other  mitigation 
measures,  which  reduce  reliance  on  imported  fossil  fuels,  while  building  local  resilience,  capacity  and 
self-sufficiency. In this regard, the harnessing of the country's geothermal resources over the next decade 
will  considerably  reduce  Dominica's  reliance  on  imported  fossil  fuels  as  the  principal  source  for 
electricity, and will liberate considerable resources spent on fuel imports which can be directed to priority 
adaptation measures to build resilience in vulnerable communities and sectors.  Continued expansion of 
Dominica's  geothermal  resources  from  2025  onwards  will  enable  the  country  to  export  significant 
amounts  of  renewable  energy  to  nearby  countries,  thereby  contributing  to  global  efforts  to  reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

National Circumstances 
Dominica is located at 15 degrees North and 61 degrees West, occupying a central position in the eastern 
Caribbean archipelago. The country is bordered by the French territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique to 
the north and south respectively. The island is approximately 750.6 square kilometers and is the largest in 
the Windward and Leeward groups of the Eastern Caribbean.  
 
Figure 1: Map of Dominica 

 

 
Dominica is volcanic in origin and is characterized by very rugged and steep terrain with approximately 
ninety miles of coastline. The northern half of the island is dominated by the country's highest summit, 
Morne Diablotin, which is the highest and largest volcano in Dominica, and the second highest mountain 
in the Eastern Caribbean, measuring 22 km x 18 km at its base and towering to a height of 1447 meters. A 
chain of mountains extends from the islands center to the south, and the topography is characterized by a 
number of ridges and steep river valleys with gently sloping lands being restricted to narrow coastal strips, 
particularly in the center and northeast of the island. The islands volcanic natural history remains evident 
in continuing seismic activity, and in scenic attractions such as the Valley of Desolation and the Boiling 
Lake,  which  together  with  dense  forests  populated  with  an  abundance  of  natural  lakes  and  waterfalls, 
provide the basis for a growing eco-tourism industry.  Dominica has a forest area of 45 000 hectares - 
more than half of the island's 75 000 hectare over all land area. Dominica has rich volcanic soil and is 
well  served  by  over  365  streams  and  rivers. The  high  mountains and  deep  ravines  are  covered  in rich 
tropical  forests.  Since  1975,  an  extensive  system  of  national  protected  areas  constitutes  a  significant 
carbon  sink  and  provides  protection  for  approximately  20%  of  the  national  territory.  Protected  areas 
include one marine park, two large forest reserves (Central and Northern), and the Morne Trois Pitons 
National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
 
Dominica is part of a group of 47 countries and territories that have been classified by the United Nations 
(UN) as Small Island Developing States (SIDS). SIDS face a specific set of challenges and are especially 
highly vulnerable to the effects and impacts of climate change. 
 

 

 
Climate and Vulnerability 
Dominica's  climate  is  characterized  as  tropical  maritime  with  dominant  influences  being  the  Atlantic 
Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the northeasterly trade winds. As a result of its mountainous terrain the 
island possesses a number of micro-climates. Rainfall is distributed between a dry season from December 
to May, and a rainy season from June to November. The western Caribbean coast is in the rain shadow of 
the  various  mountain  ranges  and  average  rainfall  along  that  coast  is  significantly  less  than  in  interior 
locations.  Limitations  in  measuring  equipment  have  restricted  the  ability  to  maintain  meteorological 
records  of  interior  areas.  High  rainfall  makes  the  island  susceptible  to  landslides,  particularly  in 
mountainous areas. Dominica's rugged topography results in considerable amount of orographic rainfall. 
 
The  island's  climate  is  characterized  by  consistently  warm  year-round  temperatures  with  a  daytime 
average  of  26-27  degrees  Celsius  in coastal  areas  decreasing  to  19-21  degrees  Celsius  in  mountainous 
areas,  while  night-time  temperatures  vary  from  18-22  degrees  Celsius  on  the  coast  and  10-12  degrees 
Celsius at higher elevations.   
 
Rainfall  patterns  display  considerable  variability  both  on  annual  and  locational  basis.  Nevertheless, 
Dominica's mountainous terrain makes it the wettest island in the eastern Caribbean with annual rainfall 
totals exceeding 10,000mm (400 inches) in some of the higher elevations. The island experiences a dry 
season  between  the  months  of  February  to  June,  with  November  being  statistically  the  wettest  month. 
Relative humidity remains high throughout the year consistently averaging above 85% in  mountainous 
interior  areas.  Generally  rainfall  is  less  on  the  islands  western  Leeward  coast  which,  based  on  the 
prevailing winds, is within a rain-shadow of the mountainous interior.  
 
The island lies within the Atlantic hurricane belt. Since the late 1970s the island has been increasingly 
affected  by  a  number  of  hurricanes  and  tropical  storms.    In  1979  Hurricane  David  caused  extensive 
destruction  particularly  in  the  southern  parts  of  the  island.  In  1995,  Hurricane  Luis  also  caused  wide-
spread  damage  and  in  August  2007  Hurricane  Dean  struck  the  island  causing  widespread  damage  to 
agricultural  outputs  as  well  as  to  road  infrastructure  estimated  at  almost  20  percent  of  GDP.  Tropical 
Storm Ophelia in 2011 and Tropical Storm Erika in August 2015 resulted in loss of life and property and 
devastated the island.   
 
Dominica was originally populated by Amerindian peoples, known as Kalinago, and is the only island in 
the  Caribbean  still  to  possess  distinct  communities  of  these  indigenous  people  of  the  Caribbean. 
Population estimates for 2001 indicate that Dominica had a population of approximately 71,000 persons (a 
decline  from  74,750  in  1994),  including  two  thousand  Kalinagos,  the  remaining  survivors  of  the  first 
inhabitants of the island. 27.0% of the Dominican households live below the poverty line (based on the 
latest available figures), Topographic conditions have forced human settlements onto narrow coastal areas 
particularly in the south and west with approximately 44,000 persons (62%) living along the coast. The 
largest community is Roseau (the capital city) and its environs with 14,847 persons representing almost 
21% of the total population. 
 
Dominica, like its Caribbean neighbours, is among the most vulnerable regions to global climate change 
(IPCC, 1995, 1997, 2001, 2007). Sea level rise will combine a number of factors resulting in accelerated 
coastal erosion, increased flood risk and in some areas permanent loss of land. This may be exacerbated 
further by any increase in the destructiveness of tropical storms, the impacts of which will be greater due 
to sea-level rise even without increases in storm intensity. The impacts of sea-level rise will be further 
exacerbated by the loss of protective coastal systems such as coral reefs. The Caribbean has experienced 
widespread coral loss in recent decades due to a variety of interacting factors including bleaching, which 
has become more frequent due to higher ocean surface temperatures, a trend which will continue into the 
future as a result of climate change. Impacts attributed to climate change in Dominica are: a change in 
average  climate;  sea-level  rise;  changing  distribution  of  carriers  of  disease;  increased  incidence  of  hot 

 

 
days;  changes  in  rainfall  patterns;  more  acidic  oceans  (less  CO2  dissolved  in  warmer  ocean  water);  a 
change in the incidence and intensity of extreme weather events (storm surge, flash floods and tropical 
hurricanes).Vulnerability of human settlements in Dominica to existing weather and climate change can 
be viewed in terms of risks from coastal processes, inland flooding, and landslides. A consistent feature of 
human settlements in Dominica is the vulnerability of roads and buildings to storm surge flooding and 
landslides. Inadequate planning controls are apparent in the continuing construction of buildings, critical 
infrastructure and other facilities in active wave inundation, flood- and landslide-prone areas. 
 
Economy 
With GDP standing at US$517million (2014 - IMF estimates), the Dominica economy reflects many of 
the traditional features of a small open economy. This includes a high level of dependence on external 
trade as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), dependence on single sector export products (in 
this  case  agriculture)  and  tourism  revenue,  high  levels  of  underemployment  and  unemployment,  and 
dependence on foreign capital (both public and private sector) for investment into productive sectors and 
for  infrastructural  development.  Over  the  past  10  years,  economic  growth  in  Dominica  averaged 
approximately 3.7% per annum, dropping to 1.5% over the past 5 years. The population of the country has 
remained relatively unchanged over recent years (approximately 70,000), and is not expected to increase 
in the next 10-15 years.  Since the year 2000, contributions to GDP have increased in the agricultural, 
private  education  and  hospitality  industries,  with  declining  trends  in  manufacturing,  real  estate  and 
banking.   
 
The vulnerability of Dominica's agricultural sector - which together with tourism is the mainstay of the 
country's economy - is manifested in the risks presented by natural disasters and climate extremes, as well 
as in the sectors vulnerability to climate variability and external economic shocks. The World Bank points 
out that Dominica's real agricultural sector product and agriculture's share of GDP has fallen consistently 
with each major natural disaster with the sector failing to recover to previous levels of relative importance.  
Most  of  this  decline  is  attributable  to  the  crop  sector,  and  within  that  sector,  to  the  decline  in  banana 
production. Otherwise there has been significant growth only within the small livestock sub-sector. The 
World  Bank  indicates  that  "the  post  disaster  shift  out  of  agriculture  seems  to  be  explained  by  a 
combination of a further reduction in larger scale production (failure to invest fully in replacement), a shift 
of small shareholders into employment in other sectors, and also off-island migration".  
 
Agricultural  production  accounted  for  12.2%  of total  GDP,  and  overall the sector is estimated to  have 
declined by 10.6 percent in 2010 on the heels of a 1.5 percent growth rate for 2009. The performance of 
the  crops  sub-sector  was  severely  affected  by  the  extended  drought  in  2010.  Agriculture's  decline  has 
been particularly marked since Hurricane Hugo. Crop sector product in real terms in the late 1990s was 
20% below the 1988 peak caused primarily by the decline of the banana industry, which has maintained 
this  pattern  during  the  2000s.  Agricultural  access  roads  have  been  severely  damaged  or  destroyed  by 
Tropical  Storm  Erika  in  August  2015,  which  resulted  in  losses  to  the  agriculture  sector  of  US$30.83 
million (est), creating additional challenge to the sector. For a country that could be self-sufficient and 
provide food to neighbouring countries, Dominica's food imports constitute an increasing burden on the 
economy,  and  threaten  food  security.  Impacts  from  climate  change,  affecting  agricultural  productivity, 
continue to aggravate this situation.    
 
With  the  rapid  decline  in the  major  cash crop (bananas),  many  farmers  began moving  into  the fishing 
sector, which employs approximately 2000 registered fishermen (40% full-time).  There is a much greater 
demand  for  fish  at  the  present  time  as  a  major  source  of  protein.  Dominica's  fishery  resources  are 
relatively diverse including near-shore demersal and pelagic species, as well as deep-water pelagics and 
various  crustaceans  and  other  marine  species.  The  Dominica  fishing  industry  is  small-scale  and  of  an 
artisan nature. All the fish caught is for local consumption. Most fish landed in Dominica is sold directly 
to the public at the landing sites. The damage caused by Hurricane Lenny in 1999 on the Roseau Fisheries 

 

 
Complex were very obvious during the following fishing season when there was a marked increase in tuna 
landings, however, the lack of storage facilities posed a major problem in terms of selling the catch. This 
resulted  in  wastage  and  the  loss  of  revenue  to  fishermen.  Already  fishery  resources  face  considerable 
stresses  from  a  number  of  land  based  sources  of  pollution.  Existing  climate  stresses  especially 
hurricane/tropical  storm  systems  and  warming  oceans  present  important  challenges  for  the  health  and 
sustainability  of  the  ecosystems  that  sustain the  islands  fisheries.  Climate  change,  including  increasing 
ocean acidification and changes in sea temperatures, are affecting fisher resources and migration patterns 
with consequent impacts on the sustainability of Dominica's fishery sector, livelihoods, human health and 
prospects for food security. Climate change impacts on Dominica's vibrant diving and whale-watching 
industry are yet to be determined.  
 
The  island  has  always  been  in  a  vulnerable  position  economically,  socially,  culturally,  and 
environmentally.  Economic  developments,  in  particular,  are  significantly  affected  by  both  natural  and 
man-made external factors as is increasingly evidenced by the negative impact on the local economy of 
changes  associated  with  such  international  phenomenon  as  globalization  and  trade  liberalization.  The 
dependence of the economy on the constricting banana industry exposes its high economic vulnerability. 
Attempts  to  diversify  are  slow,  however  recent  trends  indicate  that  the  island  is  moving  towards 
tourism/ecotourism, as it markets its unique environment and culture. In doing so Dominica has become 
more  acutely  aware of  the  need  to  protect  the environment  and of the  growing  threat to its  vulnerable 
natural resources presented by climate change.  
 
The prevailing economic situation over the past twenty years has given rise to sluggish growth and little 
improvement in the levels of poverty. The present government was compelled to establish a programme of 
Economic Stabilization and Recovery in early 2001, which was aimed at, among other things maintaining 
fiscal stability and energizing economic growth. The stabilization programme,  which imposes stringent 
austerity  measures,  is  intended  to  reduce  public  sector  expenditure  to  sustainable  levels  in  line  with 
required standards set by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World 
Bank (WB). Now in 2015, while still facing  social and economic challenges, there are indications that 
Dominica is making steady progress on the road to recovery. 
 
Energy and Carbon Footprint 
Dominica  has  no  petroleum  resources,  and  energy  required  to  sustain  development  in  the  country  is 
imported. Annual import costs for energy continue to rise and are currently EC$116.65 million (US$43.39 
million) representing 11.92% of GDP (2014 - World Bank estimates). Electricity constitutes the primary 
source of commercial energy for industrial and other uses in Dominica, while approximately 8000 cubic 
meters of woodfuel are used domestically. The main end users of electricity are domestic, commercial and 
institutional customers and the pattern of consumption demonstrates the low energy use of industry and 
other non-domestic consumption at this time. The other main source of energy use in Dominica is in the 
road  transport  sector.  As  in  most  other  developing  countries  road  transport  consumes  an  increasing 
amount of petroleum.  
 
As with all other island states and territories in the Caribbean, Dominica is affected by the global crisis 
caused by its dependency on imported petroleum products with the constant fluctuations in prices. High 
electricity costs (the highest in the Caribbean), constitute a real obstacle for numerous sectors, with the 
direct  and  indirect  consequence  of  curtailing  growth  and  parallel  activities  linked  to  the  country's 
sustainable development. Dominica recognises that current high costs associated with importation of fossil 
fuel-based energy is unsustainable, a draw on the economy, diverts much needed resources from priority 
poverty  reduction  and  social  development  programs,  and  reduces  the  availability  of  funds  needed  to 
address impacts from climate change and natural disasters.   
 

 

 
Electricity Network and Demand 
The country presently (2014) has an installed capacity of 26.74 megawatts consisting of 6.64MW (28.5%) 
of hydropower and 20.1 MW of diesel powered units. The generation mix is characterized by seasonal 
fluctuations  in  supply  from  hydro-generation  as  a  result  of  changes  in  precipitation  during  the  rainy 
season. Peak demand has averaged approximately 16 MW over the past three years, with average demand 
of  11.5  MW.  Minimum  overnight  demand  has  averaged  7.3  MW  over  the  past  3  years,  requiring 
approximately 8 MW of generation online (9.6% losses).  
 
From 2012 to 2014, minimum instantaneous demand has varied between 6MW and 8.5MW, averaging 
around  7.3MW  for  the  past  3  years.  Some  large  consumers  of  electricity  (hotels,  manufacturers, 
university) self-generate using diesel engines as this provides lower costs electricity than provided by the 
domestic  electrical  utility.  The  Independent  Regulatory  Commission  (IRC)  has  established  a  limit  of 
1MW of grid connected intermitted renewable energy, of which approximately 0.5 MW has already been 
installed. An additional 125kw community renewable energy system is being considered.  
Electricity  sales  have  grown  on  average  3.7%  per  annum  over  the  past  10  years,  with  much  of  this 
between 2008 and 2010. Over the past 3 years there has been no growth due to the depressed economic 
climate. Corresponding to this has been a decline in electricity consumption in the domestic sector. The 
proportion  of  electricity  sold  in  the  commercial  sector  has  increased,  which  reflects  growth  in  the 
hospitality, tourism and higher education sectors. The 20 year forecasts for electrical sales provided by 
Dominica  Electric  Company  (DOMLEC)  indicates  average  growth  rates  of  1.3%  and  0.8%  for  yearly 
electricity generation and peak demand respectively, based on assumed economic growth rate of 1.6%.   
 
Development of Alternative Energy Sources 
The  Government  of  Dominica  in  seeking  to  reduce  the  increasing  costs  of  electricity  generation  and 
ensure a cleaner, more environmentally friendly energy source is aggressively exploring the possibilities 
of alternative energy. While hydroelectric generation does occur (contributing up to ~ 38% of electricity 
generation),  and  Dominica  has  considerable  additional  potential,  hydro-power  development  is  severely 
affected by changing precipitation patterns association with climate change. Dominica, being a volcanic 
island has tremendous potential for geothermal energy. Site assessments, and feasibility studies have been 
carried out that indicate that the energy capacity in the Roseau Valley Geothermal Resource area is at least 
300  MW,  The  current  production  capacity  based  on  Wells  already  drilled  is  approximately  10  MW. 
Further generation capacity can be added with the drilling of additional production wells as assessed and 
necessary. 
A limited amount of solar and wind energy is used in Dominica, mainly at the residential and commercial 
levels  for  both  water  heating  and  electricity  production.  It  is  hoped  that  hydro,  solar,  wind,  wave  and 
biomass as alternative energy sources, will eventually be considered on a commercial scale. Dominica's 
Low  Carbon  Climate  Resilient  Development,  National  Energy  Policy  (draft)  (2014),  and  Sustainable 
Energy Plan (draft) (2014) establishes indicative targets for renewable energy in Dominica.  
 
GHG Projections for 2015-2030 
The Graph below depicts: 

•  The Business as Usual (BAU) case from 2005 to 2030; 
•  The total emissions from 2005 to 2030; 
•  The emissions trends by Sector and year from 2005 to 2030. 
 

The BAU case used Table 2.6 from Dominica's Second National Communication (SNC), which provides 
emission changes from 2000 to 2005, as its starting point. It provides emissions data on four of the five 
sectors. The data for the fifth sector, solid waste, was also obtained from the SNC. The projections for 

 

 
emissions post 2014 for each sector were derived from the application of the energy intensity value for 
each of the mitigation measures analyzed and further breaking down this data by reporting year. The total 
emissions for each year were the total of the sector emissions for that year.  
 

 
 
Proposed Mitigation Measures to Enhance Resilience 
In order to achieve the GHG targets contained in this INDC, Dominica intends to implement the following 
measures to enhance resilience, which amounts to approximately US$99 million in costs. 
 
 
1. New Geothermal Generation Plants. 
It  is  the  intention  of  the  Government  of  Dominica  to  develop,  with  concessionary  climate  change 
financing provided under the Green Climate Fund or Clean Technology Fund, a geothermal generation 
plant to provide electricity to the domestic market. The first phase of this plant will comprise 2 X 3.5MW 

 

 

 
electricity generation units, with the physical plant designed to accommodate another 3.5MW generator in 
the future. The first, 2 X 3.5MW plant is planned for operation before 2020, with the third 3.5MW 2025. 
The Government of Dominica seeks to harness geothermal resources in manner and at a cost that will 
ensure that electricity charges to consumers do not increase.  
Program Timing: 1st Plant; 2020, 2nd (expansion); 2025;  
Forecasted Emission Reductions: 39.3Gg;  
Capital Cost Estimate: US$75,000,000. 
 
2. Energy Efficiency (EE) Programme 
This EE program will be country wide, and will include the Manufacturing, Commercial and Institutional 
sectors. Such programmes carried out in other jurisdictions in the Latin America and Caribbean Region 
have resulted in energy savings in the order of 15 to 20% of total energy usage, and should achieve similar 
results  in  Dominica.  Market  based  mechanisms  are  to  be  introduced  to  enhance  the  uptake  of  these 
programmes. The EE programme for Dominica will be designed and implemented to address the specific 
issues  of  this  country  and  shall  focus  on  retrofitting  of  energy  efficient  lighting,  air-conditioning, 
appliances, and a vigorous education and awareness drive. Estimated installation costs have been based on 
the results of the audits of similar facilities in the LAC Region. 
Program Timing: 2016-2025;  
Forecasted Emissions Reduction: 5.2 Gg; Installation; 
Cost Estimate: US$2,300,000. 
 
3. Solar Photovoltaic (PV) conversion program for Hotel Sector 
This sector includes hotels and guesthouses. There are approximately 29 such facilities in Dominica, but 
there is insufficient detail provided to determine size and individual energy usage. Estimates have been 
made to derive the quantity of systems that may be involved and anticipated GHG reductions based on 
lessons learned from similar conversions undertaken in the region. The solar PV programme will comprise 
the installation of solar PV panels and related equipment on the roofs (and in some cases, the grounds) of 
buildings in this sector. 
Program Timing: 2016-2025;  
Forecasted Emissions Reductions: 0.24Gg; 
Capital Cost Estimate: US$1,000,000. 
 
4.  Solar  Photovoltaic  (PV)  conversion  program  for  Commercial,  Institutional  and  Manufacturing 
Facilities 
This program will include: schools, universities, hospitals, commercial buildings, manufacturing plants, 
government  buildings,  municipal  facilities,  etc.  Estimates  have  been  made  to  derive  anticipated  GHG 
reductions based on lessons learned from similar conversions undertaken in the region. 
Program Timing: 2017-2025;  
Forecasted Emission Reductions: 0.86Gg:   
Capital Cost Estimate: US$2,700,000. 
 
5. Off-Grid Hybrid Micro-Hydro, Wind, Solar PV, DG Back-up for Ross University 
Ross  University  is  the  single  largest  electricity  user  in  Dominica,  with  significant  annual  electricity 
charges. In order to compute possible emission reductions and estimate costs, 200kW of in-stream micro-
hydro, 100kW of solar PV and 500kW of wind (assuming a site is available and a reasonable wind regime 
is available), and 500kW of back-up diesel generation, connected as a hybrid power plant in an off-grid 
mini-grid configuration have been calculated as being required to meet average projected power demand 
at the University.  
Program Timing: 2017-2022;  
Forecasted Emission Reductions: 1.71Gg;  
Capital Cost Estimate: US$3,300,000. 

 

 
6.  Off-Grid  Hybrid  Wind, Solar,  Biodiesel  Generator  Back-up in  Off-grid Mini-Grid  Configuration for 
South-East and East Coast of Dominica (three separate projects) 
Based  on  lessons  learned  from  Tropical  Storm  Erika  and  other  recent  extreme  events,  this  region  of 
Dominica is particularly vulnerable to storm damage, and the power systems in this area are vulnerable to 
damaged rendering communities without electricity. Since the amount of remaining availability of grid 
connected intermitted renewable energy (IRE) systems is very limited, to increase power system reliability 
and reduce energy costs for the residents in these locations, off-grid mini-grids, powered with hybrid wind 
and solar PV power plants (and hydro if available), with bio-diesel generator back-up, are proposed as a 
possible  viable  alternative.  Three  separate  mini-grids,  estimated at 500kW  each,  comprising  500kW  of 
wind energy and 200kW of PV, with bio-diesel generator back-up for each, are proposed. 
Program Timing: 2017-2025;  
Forecasted Emission Reductions: 2.92Gg;  
Capital Cost Estimate: US$9,000,000. 
 
7. Replace Streetlights in Portsmouth with Off-grid Light Emitting Diode (LED) Fixtures. 
There  are  some  368,  100W  HPS  streetlights  in  Portsmouth  at  present.  This  project  comprises  the 
replacement of these with smaller, off-grid LED streetlights. 
Program Timing: 2016-2025;  
Forecasted Emission Reductions: 0.36Gg;  
Installation Cost Estimate: US$1,200,000. 
 
8. Transport Sector Emissions 
11,167 vehicles were imported into the country between 2005 and 2014. During that same period, 6,624 
older vehicles were retired, for a net increase of 4,543 vehicles over this period. The largest percentage of 
these  were  sport  utility  vehicles  (SUVs),  with  an  increase  of  2,950  of  these  during  this  period. 
Accordingly, GHG emissions during this period increased from 46.8Gg in 2005 to 71Gg in 2014.  This is 
a  very  serious  problem,  which  if  not  arrested,  will  prevent  Dominica  from  adequately  reducing  GHG 
emissions in the future. Currently, import duties and charges amount to approximately 140% on motor 
vehicles imported into Dominica. Additionally, there is an environmental tax added on imported vehicles, 
which  ranges  from  1%  of  the  total  value  (including  freight  charges)  on  vehicles  less  than  5yrs,  to 
EC$3,000  on  vehicles  older  than  5yrs.  Two  priority  steps  are  proposed,  starting  as  soon  as  practically 
possible: 
(i)  Introduce a policy that, all government vehicles, at their time of replacement, will be replaced by 

(ii)  Introduce  market  based  mechanisms  to  motivate  the  private  sector  to  buy  hybrid  vehicles  when 

hybrids vehicles; 

replacing current vehicles. 

It  is  expected that  these actions  will be  implemented  before  2020,  and  will  continue to  the  end of the 
reporting period, 2030, and beyond. 
Program Timing: 2016-2030;  
Forecasted Emission Reductions: 12Gg 
 
9. Reduce Methane Emissions from Landfill 
Dominica's  existing  landfill  commenced  operation  in  2005.  It  is  a  modern,  engineered  landfill,  with  a 
liner, leachate collection, and capping. Methane collection vents were installed from the start, and have 
been venting the methane produced from the organic waste decomposition process ever since. This project 
will abate most of this methane by: (a) diverting organics from the waste stream that is currently deposited 
in  the  landfill;  and  (b)  suitably  preparing  the  landfill,  and  installing  a  flaring  system.  In  addition,  the 
present landfill needs to be expanded if it is expected to receive more waste within the next 5 years. The 
previous  dumpsites that  were  closed  off  also  need to  be  considered  for  methane  collection  and  flaring 
system. These are the Point Ronde and Stockfarm dumpsites which were closed when the new site was 
commissioned. In order to further reduce methane emissions and reach our target, the present volume of 

 
 

organic  waste  brought  into  the  landfill  (40%  of  all  waste)  has  to  be  reduced.  This  can  be  done  by 
implementing a fully integrated solid waste management program that involves the following: 
(i) 
(ii)  Curbside pickup of organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); 
(iii)  Curbside  pickup  of  individual  types  of  non-organic  waste  (separation  from  source  with  revised 

Public awareness and extension program throughout the island;  

collection system); 

(iv)  Material recovery facilities and composting facilities in selected regions on the island. 
Upgrading only the landfill will not solve the problem of methane gas emissions unless what is actually 
brought to the landfill is managed systematically. In order to achieve this goal, upgrades and equipment 
will be required to the amount of US$3,008,921.00. 
Program Timing: 2016-2021;  
Forecasted Emission Reductions: >11Gg;  
Capital Cost Estimates: $4,508,921 
 
10. Other Measures 
The following are other high priority measures that will commence during the 2016-2020 period, as part 
of the energy efficiency program: 
•  Education and awareness program, at school level, as well as an awareness building program for the 

general public; 

•  Make  energy  efficient  appliances  more  readily  available,  include  their  importance  in  the  programs 

above; 
Institutional strengthening at the government level, and capacity building for the private sector (e.g. 
contractors, maintenance personnel, and other personnel); 

•  Develop  and  implement  a  climate  resilient  energy  efficient  building  code  (Green  Building  Code) 

• 

including a training and capacity building program; 

•  Sustainable  Energy  programs  for  private  residences,  including  solar  PV  and  solar  thermal,  using 

innovative financing mechanisms to offset capital costs for home owners;  
Measures to reduce GHG emissions from the Agriculture Sector including through the harnessing of 
biomass. 

 
 
Building Climate Resilience (Adaptation) 
Dominica's  Low  Carbon  Climate  Resilient  Development  Strategy  provides  an  overview  of  the  country 
circumstances, the development context and identifies climate change vulnerabilities in key sectors, for 
specifically vulnerable groups, for the private sector, important eco-systems and natural resources. It also 
provides  an  overview  of  linkages  to  existing  development  plans  and  programs,  most  importantly 
Dominica's  Growth  and  Social  Protection  Strategy  (GSPS)  and  Dominica's  National  Climate  Change 
Adaptation Policy. Section 5 of Dominica's Low Carbon Climate Resilient Development Strategy contains 
a policy, legal and institutional analysis that list key agencies involved in managing climate change risks, 
together with the associated legal/policy framework.  
 
Dominica's Low-Carbon Climate Resilient Development Strategy and compendium Strategic Programme 
for  Climate  Resilience  (SPCR)  were  developed  through  an  extensive  consultative  process  that  was 
supported under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) funded under the Climate Investment 
Funds (CIF). As part of the process to develop Dominica's Low-Carbon Climate Resilient Development 
Strategy and SPCR, various assessments and studies were undertaken and reviewed with and by national 
stakeholders to provide the technical foundation for the preparation of the Strategy and this compendium 
SPCR. Key steps in Dominica's SPCR prioritization planning process included:  
(a)  Document  stocktaking,  review  and  analysis  including  a  critical  review  of  Dominica's  Climate 
Change Adaptation Policy and Action Plan(2002) (endorsed by Cabinet in 2002) that was developed 
with support under the Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Climate Change project, and analysis of 

 
 

current  and  ongoing  national  development  policies,  programs  and  initiatives  in  particular  the 
Government  of  Dominica's  Growth  and  Social  Protection  Strategy  (GSPS)  which  articulates  a 
medium-term strategy for growth and poverty reduction over the next five years and sets priorities to 
make poverty reduction the principal focus of Government's economic and social policy;

(b)  Broad-based  stakeholder  climate  change  risk  assessment  (including  prioritization  and  ranking  of 
climate 
assessment 
approach/methodology/guidelines which were developed under the Adapting to Climate Change in the 
Caribbean (ACCC) project and based on climate change trend analysis and projections contained in 
Dominica's Initial National Communication (INC) and Second National Communication (SNC) to the 
UNFCCC; 

affecting  Dominica) 

(c)  Critical review of Dominica's National Capacity Self Assessment (NCSA) and an  Adaptive Capacity 
Assessment  (assessing  institutional,  systematic,  individual  capacity)  for  public  and  private  sector, 
vulnerable communities/sectors that served to update and validate recommendations contained in the 
NCSA; 

(d)  Community  Surveys  undertaken  to  identify  climate  change  vulnerabilities,  capacities  and  priority 
needs  that  built  upon  community  vulnerability  mapping  and  adaptive  capacity  assessments, 
undertaken  under  Dominica's  Sustainable  Land  Management  project  and  Special  Program  on 
Adaptation to Climate Change (SPACC) project; 

(e)  Identification of priority needs and investment opportunities to facilitate Dominica's transformation 
to a climate-resilient development path, that was undertaken during the SPCR National Consultative 
Workshop; 

(f)  Cost-benefit Analysis of proposed SPCR investment opportunities that was undertaken with technical 
support/methodologies  provided  by  the  Caribbean  Community  Climate  Change  Center  (CCCCC) 
under Phase 1 of the regional track SPCR program.  

 
The climate change risk assessment built upon the Stocktaking and Institutional Analysis undertaken 
under  the  National  Capacity  Self  Assessment  (NCSA)  and  the  vulnerability  assessments  undertaken  to 
develop  Dominica's  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Policy,  Initial  National  Communication  and  Second 
National  Communication  (SNC).  The  climate  change  risk  assessment  was  modeled  on  the  process 
outlined in the Risk Management Guidelines for Climate Change Adaptation Decision Making1. Using a 
multiple  criteria  analysis,  each  PPCR  Technical  Working  Group  (TWG)  undertook  a  sector  specific 
assessment as follows: 
 
(a) 

Identification  of  event  risks  and  outcomes  risks  based  on  vulnerability  assessments  contained  in 
Dominica's  Initial  National  Communication,  National  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Policy,  and 
Second National Communication; 

 
(b)  Ranking of event/outcome risks in terms of severity of social/ economic/ environmental/ impacts 

(11 indicators used for ranking);   

 
(c)  Probability/frequency analysis on prioritized event/outcome risks that scored the highest in terms of 

severity of social/economic/environmental/impact; 

 
(d)  Once  each  sector  TWG  had  completed  the  sectoral  risk  assessment  -  stakeholders  during  the 
National Consultative Workshop verified the outcomes and developed the list of national priority 
risks based on top ranked risks for each sector.

Caribbean" (ACCC) projects funded by GEF/World Bank/CIDA. 2003. 

 
 

Through this climate change risk assessment, national stakeholders identified the following as priority 
risks from climate change:

As  part  of  the  SPCR  Adaptive  Capacity  Assessment,  a  National  Adaptive  Capacity  Assessment  was 
undertaken to evaluate national adaptation capacity needs/ priorities. This assessment highlighted the fact 
that Dominica has made considerable progress in implementing Stage 1 adaptation measures. However, 
the  implementation  of  Stage  2  and  Stage  3  measures  have  not  been  possible  due  to  serious  resource 
(human,  technical,  financial)  constraints.  The  PPCR  National  Adaptive  Capacity  Assessment  also 
identified  considerable  limitations  in  climate  change  risk  management  capacity  at  the  systematic, 
institutional and individual levels, at the national, sectoral, district and local level, and within the public 
sector and civil society, highlighting the need for considerable capacity building. The National Adaptive 
Capacity  Assessment  confirmed  the  need  for  improved  levels  of  earmarked  financial  resources  for 
climate change risk management and resiliency building as articulated in the NCSA, and the need for 
improved  coordination  amongst  key  state  and  non-state  actors  involved  in  climate  change  risk 
management.  
Additionally, using the household survey piloted under the SLM/SPACC projects, a community survey 
was undertaken during the SPCR prioritization planning process which served to refine and validate the 
risks/needs  of  vulnerable  communities  as  articulated  during  community  vulnerability  mapping  and 
adaptation  planning  undertaken  during  the  SLM/SPACC  projects.  Building  upon  earlier  analysis 
undertaken on climate change impacts on gender and other vulnerable segments of society (outlined in 
Section  9  and  the  Annex  of  Dominica's  Low  Carbon  Climate  Resilient  Development  Strategy)the 

 
 

household and community surveys highlighted concerns over food security, the urgent need to provide 
vulnerable communities with micro-insurance and micro-finance to address risks from climate change 
extreme  events  (floods,  drought,  landslides,  crop  damage,  loss  of  fishery)  affecting  subsistence 
agriculture/fishery  production,  and  the  urgent  need  for  community  based  early  warning  systems, 
community-based  vulnerability/hazard  mapping,  community  multi-use  emergency  shelters,  and 
community  risk  management  frameworks.  Improved  access  to  readily  available  financing  to  support 
priority community-based adaptation projects was also been highlighted as a priority. These investments 
are urgently needed to support transformational change in vulnerable communities whereby households 
and  individuals  assume  the  lead  role  in  building  resilient  communities  rather  than  relying  on 
overstretched  government  resources.  Lessons  learned  from  Tropical  Storm  Erika  that  devastated 
Dominica  in  August  2015  has  highlighted  the  need  to  implement  these  priority  interventions  which, 
despite US$20 million being secured under the SPCR program, remains largely unfunded.  
By addressing the deficiencies identified during the SPCR priority planning process, SPCR interventions 
were intended to support the establishment of an appropriate enabling framework to guide and facilitate 
Dominica's transformation to a low-carbon climate resilience development pathway that can serve as a 
model  for  other  small  island  developing  States  in  the  region.  By  positioning  climate  change  as  a 
development  issue  rather  than  an  environmental  issue,  Dominica's  SPCR  provides  the  opportunity  to 
demonstrate  viable  interventions  to  address  climate  change  risks  within  the  context  of  a  national 
development framework that establishes the country firmly on the path to a Green Economy.  
SPCR 
that  climate  change 
planning/management  becomes  an  integral  part  of  the  national  development  planning  process  under 
Dominica's  Growth  and  Social  Protection  Strategy  (GSPS)  and  Low  Carbon  Climate  Resilient 
Development Strategy, the latter having been formulated during the SPCR planning process. In supporting 
the  transition  from  the  situation  whereby  government  is  solely  responsible  for  climate  change  risk 
management to a country where this is a shared responsibility, SPCR interventions have to opportunity 
to  demonstrate  a  model  for  transformation  changes  that  could  benefit  other  developing  countries. 
Sustainability will be achieved by establishing effective partnerships with all stakeholders (public sector 
and civil society, technical and financial partners, local governments, vulnerable communities, grass-roots 
organizations) to transform Dominica to a low-carbon climate resilient country that will make a significant 
contribution to sustainable development in the country, and add value by ensuring that the SPCR is not a 
standalone activity, but becomes a responsibility assumed by all stakeholders.   
 
 
Priorities for Building Climate Resilience 
While there are several sectors and issues identified by national stakeholders as being important to address 
climate  change  risks  in  Dominica,  there  are  a  few  that  require  priority  attention  if  building  of  climate 
resilience is to be achieved. Outlined below are the issues considered by national stakeholders during the 
SPCR planning process and INDC development process to be a priority for Dominica, that have not yet 
been  funded  or  implemented,  and  which  possess  the  greatest  potential  to  contribute  to  the  successful 
transformation of the country to a climate resilient low carbon development path.  
 
(a)  Addressing climate change mitigation measures on the basis that savings in energy costs will allow 

long-term  by  ensuring 

interventions  are 

Dominica to invest more in priority and much needed adaptation measures; 

to  be  sustained 

in 

the 

(b)  Establishing  community  off-grid  mini-grid  or  micro-grid  renewable  energy  electrical  supply 
systems  (backed  up  by  emergency  alternative  energy  systems  (such  bio-diesel generators, should 
local conditions allow for the operation to be efficiently established) in vulnerable communities on 
the east and south east coasts that are periodically without electricity as a consequence of storm and 
hurricane events;    

 
 

(i) 

(j) 

(c)  Establishing early warning systems, multi-use disaster shelters (powered by renewable energy and 
back  up  bio-diesel  generators)  and  emergency  preparedness  training  programs  in  vulnerable 
communities; 

(d)  Facilitating  capacity  building  through  education,  awareness  and  training  programs  on  climate 
change risks and resiliency measures in order to strengthen capacity at the community and sectoral 
level, within municipalities and local authorities, and the private sector; 

(e)  Promotion  of  Food  Security  through  Climate  Resilient  Agricultural/Fisheries  Development  to 
build  climate  resilient  communities  by  strengthening  capacity  to  address  climate  change  risks  to 
food security associated with changing precipitation patterns; 

(f)  Establishing the enabling legal/institutional framework to facilitate coordination/implementation 
of  priority  climate  change  measures  and  the  mainstreaming  of  climate  change  activities  into 
national, sectoral and community planning/development; 

(k) 

(g)  Creating the supportive enabling framework whereby communities and vulnerable segments of 
society (women,  youth,  elderly,  people  with  disabilities)  can manage  their  own  climate  change 
risks,  thereby  addressing  climate  change  impacts  on  vulnerable  sectors  (particularly  agriculture, 
fisheries  and  water  resources)  and  threats  to  food  security,  human  health,  poverty  alleviation, 
sustainable livelihoods and economic growth; 

(h)  Establishing a sustainable financing mechanism to ensure timely and direct access to international 
climate change financing to implement priority climate change risks management measures by the 
private sector and vulnerable communities; 
Legal establishment of the Department of Climate Change, Environment and Development and the 
financing  of  key  technical  personnel  needed  to  ensure  effective  and  timely  implementation  and 
coordination  of  the  SPCR  program  and  other  climate  resilient  programs  under  Dominica`s  Low 
Carbon  Climate  Resilient  Development  Strategy,  and  to  serve  as  National  Implementing  Entity 
(NIE) to facilitate direct access to and management of international climate change financing under 
the Green Climate Fund; 
design and implementation of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management education 
and  awareness  program  at  all  levels  to  be  coordinated  by  the  Department  of  Climate  Change, 
Environment and Development; 
legal establishment of Climate Change Trust Fund in addition to US$5 million seed funding to the 
Climate  Change  Trust  Fund  to  provide  support  to  priority  community  climate  change  risks 
management  measures  identified  through  community  vulnerability  mapping  and  adaptation 
planning  and  the  establishment  of  micro-finance  and  micro-insurance  for  private  sector  and 
vulnerable  segments  of  society  (farmers,  fisher-folk,  women  and  vulnerable  communities  in 
particular the Kalinago people). 

 
Costs for the abovementioned priority adaptation measures that are to be implemented over the next 5 
years are US$25 million. 
 
 
Implementation 
Implementation of priority climate change programs is a joint responsibility led by the Ministry of Health 
and  Environment.  The  Council  for  Environment,  Climate  Change  and  Development  (CECCD)  and  the 
Department of Climate Change, Environment and Development (currently the ECU) that are to be legally 
established  under  the  proposed  Climate  Change,  Environment  and  Development  Bill  2015  (which  has 
been developed through broad-based consultation and is to be presented for enactment before the end of 
2015) will be responsible for coordinating climate change programming in Dominica. It is proposed that 
the Climate Change, Environment and Development Bill be enacted prior to COP21 meeting in Paris as a 
demonstration of Government of Dominica's commitment to the establishment of the enabling framework 
to  mainstream  climate  change  into  national  planning  processes.  The  Department  of  Climate  Change, 
Environment  and  Development  is  to  establish  and  manage  the  National  Climate  Change  Trust  Fund 

 
 

established  under  the  Climate  Change,  Environment  and  Development  Bill  2015,  which  together  shall 
serve as the National Implementing Entity (NIE) for climate change programs in Dominica. Dominica will 
seek  assistance  under  the  "Readiness"  program  operated  by  the  Green  Climate  Fund  to  establish  the 
necessary  legal,  institutional  and  fiduciary  management  framework  and  accredit  the  Department  of 
Climate Change, Environment and Development as the National Implementing Entity (NIE) to facilitate 
direct access, thereby reducing dependence upon intermediary agencies for the design and implementation 
of priority adaptation interventions. 
 
The Department of Climate Change, Environment and Development will report to the CECCD to provide 
regular reports on the implementation and administration of climate change programming in Dominica. 
Given the very substantial volume of climate change investments proposed and the additional institutional 
capacity  required  to  undertake  climate  change  programming,  implementation  capacity  will  be  closely 
monitored  and  assessed  periodically  throughout  implementation.  The  Government  of  Dominica  is 
committed to providing the necessary resources to ensure the timely and successful implementation of the 
Low-Carbon  Climate-Resilient  Development  Strategy  and  compendium  SPCR,  which  have  been 
endorsed by the Hon. Roosevelt Skerrit - Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (letter of endorsement 
as of 5th April 2012) and approved by Cabinet on Tuesday, 11th April, 2012.  However, when proposing 
its contribution, Dominica recognizes that the country faces its own challenges and its contribution has 
been  assessed  in  parallel  with,  and  subject  to  the  country  priorities  in  term  of  poverty  alleviation, 
sustainable  economic  development  and  equitable  GDP  growth.  In  light  of  limited  resources,  the 
implementation of the climate change program outlined in this INDC is conditional upon receiving timely 
access  to  international  climate  change  financing,  technology  and  capacity  building  support  for  priority 
adaptation/mitigation measures. 
 
Equity 
In order to ensure the fair and equitable distribution to local communities of benefits from the harnessing 
of renewable resources to facilitate the transition to a low carbon development pat, the Government of 
Dominica  will  establish  an  appropriate  royalty  regime  for  the  commercial  exploitation  of  hydro  and 
geothermal  resources.  To  assure  fair  and  equitable  compensation  for  self-generation  owners,  the 
Government of Dominica will promote the establishment of a net metering program. This will assist in 
ensuring fair and equitable payment for excess power delivered to the grid from self-generators. 
Dominica continues to suffer considerable economic, social and environmental loss and damage due to 
impacts from climate change. The sound and sustainable management of forests in Dominica has ensured 
that GHG emissions generated in the country have been sequestered, thereby making no net contribution 
to  global  greenhouse  gas  levels.  As  a  developing  country  with  limited  economic  output  facing  serious 
challenges to implement long-standing poverty eradication programs, Dominica cannot afford to continue 
financing the loss and damage resulting from global climate change. Having made no net contribution to 
global GHG emissions, and making every effort to harness geothermal resources in a manner that will 
permit  the  country  to  export  significant  amounts  of  renewable  energy,  Dominica  seeks  an  equitable 
transfer of international climate change financing to sustain priority adaptation and mitigation programs 
that will support green growth, social development and poverty reduction in the country.
