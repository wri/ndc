Section 1. Introduction 

France  will  host  the  21st  Conference  of  Parties  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on 
Climate Change (COP21/CMP21), which will take place in Paris in December 2015 and should result 
in  a  new  international  agreement  on  the  climate  that  is  applicable  to  all  countries.    The  entire 
international  community  expects  this  agreement  to  be  universal  and  lasting.  It  should  give  the 
economic and political signals for our planet's economic development model to set out on a new path 
leading to carbon neutrality before the end of the century and to observance of the 2°C objective (i.e. 
keeping global warming at temperatures below +2°C). 

The principal goal of COP21, from November 30 to December 11, 2015, is to conclude an agreement 
that will commit 195 countries to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The end objective  is 
for  the  contributions  by  these  countries  (which  vary  from  country  to  country)  to  make  it  possible  to 
stabilise climate warming due to human activities below 2°C between now and 2100 (in comparison to 
the  pre-industrial  era).  Each  country  will  renew  its  commitments  to  the  Climate  Change  Convention 
(UNFCCC) in a document called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDC (CPDN in 
French) between now and the end of October 2015. 

Section 2. Context and institutional framework 

2.1. 

Institutional context 

The national objectives encompass two types of objectives: 

*  The mitigation objectives, the aim of which is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example 
by modifying the production techniques that are used. The Burkina Faso INDC gives quantifiable 
factors and notes the reference year, the period of commitment and the implementation schedule 
and specifies the methodologies used to estimate GHG emissions. 

*  The adaptation objectives, the aim of which is to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human 

systems to the effect of current or expected climate changes.  

The contribution to this second part of the objectives is voluntary, but important to Burkina Faso, and 
thus is to be presented in a separate scenario: Integrated Adaptation.  

Insert #1 

According  to  the  ministry  in  charge  of  sustainable  development,  the  principles  on  which  the  national 
contributions are based are:  

Ambition: The contributions will have to go beyond the countries' current national commitments. The 
current  commitments  are  part  of  the  second  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  -  notably  the 
case  of  the  European  Union  --  or  correspond  to  voluntary  national  actions  under  the  Copenhagen 
agreement and the Cancun accords. 

Fairness and differentiation: The contributions are examined in light of the national circumstances of 
each  country.  The  least  developed  countries  (LDCs)  and  the  small  island  developing  states  (SIDS) 
benefit  especially  from  a  certain  degree  of  flexibility  in  preparing  their  INDC  in  view  of  their  limited 
capabilities. 

Transparency: The contributions reported by the countries are published as they are readily available 
on  the  UNFCCC  site.  A  synthesis  report  of  all  the  parties'  contributions  will  be  presented  by  the 
UNFCCC secretariat on November 1, 2015, on the basis of the INDC's received as of October 1st.

2.2.  National strategies and policies, a sustainable development framework 

Burkina  Faso's  National  Assembly  on  the  Environment  and  Sustainable  Development,  held  in 
November  2011,  strongly  recommended  the  development  of  a  National  Sustainable  Development 
Policy (NSDP) accompanied by a law. Prepared in 2013, the NSDP was an effective framework for the 
Strategy  for  Accelerated  Growth  and  Sustainable  Development  (SAGSD).  This  economic  framework 
document, together with "Outlook Burkina 2025" and policy framework instruments, contribute to place 
the  concept  of  sustainability  at  the  heart  of  public  action  and  the  activities  of  other  non-state  actors 
(technological and financial partners, civil society  organisations, non-governmental organisations and 
the private sector) in a socioeconomic development drive that generates growth and fairly distributes 
revenues in the medium and long term in climatically high-vulnerability sectors such as those identified 
in National Communication 2.  

2.3.  Organisations and programs put in place for adaptation and mitigation  

Burkina Faso ratified the UNFCCC in 1993 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. Up to now, in response to 
the  provisions  of  these  protocols,  it  has  developed  and  adopted  a  number  of  policy  and  strategy 
documents relating to climate change. These include: 

*  The National Strategy for implementing the Climate Change Convention adopted in 2001.  

*  The National Action Program for Adaptation to Climate Change (NAPA) in 2007. 

*  The development of a framework NAMA (2008). 

*  The National Adaptation Plan (NAP, 2014). 

To address and follow up climate change issues, a Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for 
Management of the Environment (SP/CONAGECE) was created within the ministry responsible for the 
environment and which will subsequently be transformed into the National Council for the Environment 
and Sustainable Development (SP/CONEDD) with expanded responsibilities. 

In  1995,  Burkina  Faso  established  the  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  to  Implement  the  Actions  of  the 
United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change (IMCIAC).  This  committee has  been  fully 
involved in the preparation of the first National Communication on climate change. 

2.3.1  From NAPA to NAP 

Faced with the degradation of the ecosystems, the recurrence of food crises and the adverse impacts 
of  climate  change  on  the  environment,  populations  and  livestock,  the  Government  of  Burkina  Faso, 
with  the  support  of  the  UNDP  as  the  executive  agency  for  the  World  Environmental  Fund  (WEF), 
initiated  in 2005  the formulation of  its  National  Action  Program for  Adaptation to  climate  change and 
variability.  The  NAPA  was  adopted  at  the  national  level  in  2007.  In  this  context  and  under  the 
leadership of SP/CONEDD, three adaptation  projects were developed and carried out  between  2008 
and  2013  with the  support  of  Denmark  and Japan and  the World  Environmental  Fund  (WEF).  Thus, 
NAPA responded to an urgent situation in which adaptation was principally directed to those who are 
most vulnerable, particularly rural populations. 

Building  on  the  achievements  of  the  NAPA,  on  the  one  hand,  and,  on  the  other,  to  initiate  a 
comprehensive  medium-  and  long-term  approach  to  adaptation  to  climate  change    and  expand  the 
national  process    to  all  of  the  stakeholders  in  development,  Burkina  embarked  on  the  process  to 
develope a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) structured around the results of analysing the vulnerability 
to  climate  change  of  the  sectors  identified  as  priority  (agriculture,  livestock  breeding,  water,  forests 
and natural ecosystems, energy, infrastructure and housing, health etc.) and climate change scenarios 
in the 2025-2050 time period.

Burkina Faso INDC - Final INDC Report - Deliverable 7 

2.3.2  The need for a NAMA framework 

The  need  for  quantitative evaluation of  the  mitigation  potential  led  Burkina  Faso to develop  a NAMA 
framework in 2008, in this case the National Rural Sector Program (NRSP). The NRSP is part of the 
drive  for  short,  medium  and  long-term  development  programming  carried  out  through  the  Outlook 
Burkina 2025 study, the development of the National Land-Use Planning Scheme (NLUPS) and, more 
recently  (2010),  the  adoption  of  the  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Growth  and  Sustainable  Development 
(SAGSD), which replaced the Anti-Poverty Strategic Framework (APSF). 

The NRSP, which targeted the  year 2015, is a federation of sectoral programs of the departments of 
agriculture,  livestock  raising,  water,  the  environment  and  quality  of  life.  Within  this  framework,  the 
mitigation  potential  for  the  period  2008-2015  was  estimated  at  9,174,816  eq.t.CO2  of  GHG,  or 
1,200,000 eq.t.CO2 per year. 

The  proposed  mitigation  measures  contribute to  the  achievement  of  the  Government's  objective, i.e. 
the restoration of degraded land at the rate of 30,000 ha/yr, the increase of natural forests from 170,00 
to  500,000  ha,  the  reduction  of  forest  areas  burned  by  wildfires  from  30%  of  the  national  territory  to 
20%, the development of village hunting areas through the awareness and training of the population, 
and the spread of knowledge regarding techniques for sustainable management of natural resources. 

2.3.3  The Second National Communication 

Pursuant  to  article  4  and  12  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change 
(UNFCCC),  Burkina  Faso  developed  a  National  Communication  containing  the  measures  aimed  at 
mitigation  or  appropriate  adaptation  to  climate  change.  In  this  context,  a  Second  National 
Communication was developed in 2014 in accordance with the directives of decision 17/CP 8 adopted 
by  the  eighth  session  of  the  Conference  of  Parties  to  the  UNFCCC.  Since  the  process  of  its 
development began after 2006, the inventory data was based on the data for  2007 as the reference 
year.  Pointing  out  the  changes  in  climate,  the  Second  National  Communication  completes  and 
updates  certain  data  already  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  international  community  in  the  initial 
Communication of 2001, which the UNFCCC web site refers to May 2002. 

2.4.  The peculiarities of Burkina Faso's INDC 

The INDC of Burkina Faso, a weak emitter country, is one of the few that have both characteristics of 
the INDCs, namely an outcomes approach and an actions/projects/activities approach.  

This results in a Mitigation component that has taken into consideration only the activities that lead to 
credited  emission  results,  the  objectives  of  which  have  been  oriented  from  the  start  toward  the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and in particular the carbon equivalent. One example of these 
initiatives is represented by the REDD + / FIP, the NAMA initiative and the potential CDM projects in 
the  growth  sectors  such  as  mining.  These  initiatives,  dedicated  principally  to  the  reduction  of 
greenhouse gas, make up the Conditional Hybrid Mitigation / (Adaptation) scenario.  

Furthermore,  Burkina's  INDC  contains  an  Adaptation  component  that  makes  this  INDC  somewhat 
unique and ambitious since the analysis  of the  adaptation options  with their special  investments and 
"vulnerable" sectors to the search for resilience has led to an Integrated Adaptation Scenario. It is from 
this component that the projects/activities/actions approach emerges. It is strongly justified by the fact 
that  the  "rural  sector",  consisting  of  the  water-agriculture-forest-land  use  subsectors,  is  at  the  same 
time the  principal engine of the  Burkina economy (it  provides  the livelihood of  more than 80%  of the 
population) and the sector most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  

Thus, this component consists of projects whose objective is not PRINCIPALLY the reduction of GHG 
(mainly through carbon sequestration),  but the enhancement of environmental services such as food 
security, water and soil conservation, sustainable agriculture, the development of non-ligneous forest 
products,  including  medicinal  plants,  the  promotion  of  wood  and  metal  free  architecture  ("Nubian

vaults"),  etc.  As  a  bonus  to  the  mitigation  component,  these  projects  result  in  the  medium  and  long 
term in considerable reductions of GHG, which even exceed the results of mitigation efforts. 

Section 3. Mitigation projections and options 

3.1.  Methodology 

The "Mitigation" team carried out its work on the basis of the following methodology: 

*  Use  of  the  2007  GHG  inventory  by  sector  (i.e.  agriculture;  energy,  including  the  transportation 

sector; waste; industrial processes; land use; land use changes and forestry (LULUCF). 

*  Determination of the socioeconomic indicators for the "Business as Usual (BaU)" scenario for the 

GHG emissions projection at the 2030 horizon. 

*  Construction of GHG emissions projection scenarios by sector. 

* 

Identification of mitigation actions that is underway or scheduled, by sector. 

*  Analysis of the  impacts of adaptation  actions (if any)  in order to integrate their  indirect  emission 

reductions in the mitigation outcome. 

*  Evaluation of the Burkina Faso contribution in terms of mitigation. 

*  Recommendations for mitigation actions by sector. 

*  Coverage level  of the contribution: the scenarios are  based  on  data covering the entire national 

territory. 

This methodology is reflected in the report as follows: 

*  A  GHG  outcome  approach  offering  the  greatest  flexibility  in  the  way  of  reaching  the  GHG 
reductions,  without  necessarily  specifying  all  of  the  actions  the  emissions  reduction  will  entail. 
This  approach  permits  transparency  in  the  calculations  and  projections  and  assures  that  the 
progress  achieved  with  regard  to  the  actions  will  be  better  monitored  since  the  GHG  targets 
generally  take  into  consideration  the  baseline  (2014)  national  GHG  inventory  and  more 
specifically the most detailed possible sector data.  

*  As  a  result  of  point  1,  the  Government  could  commit  itself  to  quantified  results  capable  of 
providing  better  understanding  of  the  future  emissions  reductions  and  the  emissions  levels 
associated  with  the  contributions,  which,  when  combined,  facilitates  an  evaluation  of  future 
emissions  (conditional  mitigation  and  adaptation  scenario).  These  global  results  also  permit 
progress  in  carrying  out  INDC  follow-through  and  offer  greater  credibility  for  the  purpose  of 
receiving  financing  and  accessing  markets,  as  well  as  improving  comparison  between  the 
INDC's.  It  is  also  simpler  to  estimate  the  effects  and  co-benefits  under  the  GHG  outcome 
approach and/or the GHG actions approach.   

* 

In  the  Burkina  Faso  INDC,  both  approaches  have  been  used:  outcomes  in  most  cases  for 
mitigation and outcomes and projects (actions) for adaptation. 

*  Thus,  this  results  in  three  scenarios:  one  BaU  scenario,  one  unconditional  scenario  and  one 
conditional scenario that includes the adaptation project whose main objective is the reduction of 
"credited" GHGs. 

*  The Mitigation section presents these three scenarios and their descriptions by  key sectors with 
respect  to  GHG  contributions,  while  at  the  same  time  attempting  to  keep  the  same key  sectors 
throughout  the  analysis  of  the  three  scenarios  and  also  in  the  Adaptation  section  and  the 
socioeconomic section. The rest of the sectors are used only to provide an investment cost if the 
secondary projects/actions are asked to contribute to an even greater GHG reduction  at different 
horizons up to 2030 (compared to 2015).  

*  The  sectors  identified  are:  agriculture,  waste  and  energy,  including  electricity  production, 
transportation, residential and tertiary, as well as manufacturing industries, housing etc. In terms 
of representation in the report, each of these sectors will show:

3.2.  Objective: Burkina Faso contribution level 

Three  Mitigation  scenarios  have  been  considered  in  order  to  evaluate  the  emissions  trends  and  the 
possible reductions on the basis of a reference situation and the potential for financing: 

*  A  "trend"  scenario  (Business  as  Usual  -  BAU),  which  corresponds  to  continuation  of  the  past 

under the assumption that economic development continues without interruption. 

*  An  "unconditional"  scenario  taking  into  account  all  the  public  policies  adopted  after  2007, 
technological developments and recent studies, with financing that has been acquired or is being 
acquired. 

*  A  "conditional"  scenario  that  takes  into  account  all  the  mitigation  projects  that  have  been 

developed and/or are being developed, but without any acquired financing. 

3.2.1  Analysis  of  the  reference  situation  for  GHG  and  identification  of  the  reference 

year  

The chosen reference year is 2007, the date when the second report on greenhouse gas inventories 
in Burkina Faso was completed. The future projections under the various scenarios are made on the 
basis of this reference year and the appropriate parameters resulting from the previous development 
of  the  socioeconomic  situation  (trend-based)  or  the  forecast-based  assumptions  (unconditional  and 
conditional scenarios).

3.2.2  Determination and justification of the target year 

Burkina has chosen 2030 as the target year, given that this date coincides with the second Millennium 
Development  Goals  meeting.  In  addition,  the  government  of  Burkina  Faso  has  adhered  to  the 
"Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL)" initiative of the United Nations Secretary General, which aims to 
achieve three major objectives between now and 2030: 

*  Assure universal access to modern energy services. 

*  Double the rate of improvement of energy efficiency. 

*  Double the share of renewable energy in the world energy mix. 

3.2.3  Choice of the projection parameters 

The  parameters  that  can  influence  the  trends  have  been  reviewed.  In  cooperation  with  the  agency 
responsible  for  statistics,  the  National  Institute  of  Statistics  and  Demography  (INSD),  the  following

Analysis of the current trend scenario shows that Burkina's GHG emissions are going to continue to grow 
significantly. At the 2030 horizon, the emissions level will increase by a factor of five compared to 2007 and 
by a factor of almost 1.6 compared to 2015 (table 4 below).

3.2.5  Results of scenarios and analyses 

With regard to the projects and programs selected in the unconditional and conditional scenarios, the 
results of the projections shown below give the portion of reductions  that occur in comparison to the 
current trend scenario, which is also called "Business as Usual" (BAU). It should be recalled that, like 
several  developing  countries,  the  low  level  of  ownership  and  mastery  of  technologies  goes  hand  in 
hand  with  the  very  low  level  of  development  of  countries  such  as  Burkina  Faso  and  the  low  level  of 

Framework contract No 2015-AC-001-15DDU0C006-CPDN-Support Facility-Burkina Faso

their  GHG  emissions.  Despite  all  efforts,  the  urgency  of  dealing  with  recurrent  crisis  situations  in 
several sectors requires the use of low-cost technologies available in the market, which are quite often 
less  appropriate  for  local  or  global  environmental  protection  (emergency  thermal  power  plants  very 
frequently  financed  at  the  time  of  large-scale  load  shedding  and  social  movements,  dependence  on 
obsolete  means  of  transportation,  agricultural  techniques  with  little  technological  input  that  consume 
space  and  manpower,  poor  waste  management  etc.).  Hence  there  is  a  preference  to  think  of  GHG 
reductions in comparison to a possible trend rather than in comparison to a reference year that we see 
as unrealistic.

Table 6 below gives a breakdown of the reductions in the unconditional scenario. It may be seen that 
the  sectoral  mitigation  is  principally  due  to  projects  and  programmes  in  agriculture,  forestry  and 
changes  in  land  use  (between  6  and  7%  from  2020  to  2030),  technology  choices  in  the  electrical 
industry  (between  20  and  12%  from  2020  to  2030)  and  energy  efficiency  in  the  manufacturing 
industries (3% in both 2020 and 2030). These reductions are relative to the BAU trend in the sector.

Similarly, table 7 below gives a breakdown of the reductions under the conditional scenario. It may be 
seen  that  in  2030,  again  in  comparison  to  the  BaU  scenario,  the  sectoral  mitigation  would  come 
principally  from  projects  and  programmes  in  agriculture,  forestry  and  changes  in  land  use  (10% 
reduction in comparison to the sectoral trend), reduced consumption of hydrocarbons in transportation 
(42%),  technology  choices  in  the  electrical  industry  (4%)  and  efficiency  in  residential  and  tertiary 
(21%) due to mass replacement of traditional lighting with low-consumption light bulbs. The reductions 
mentioned here are in relation to the BAU trend of the sector.

Over the  last 15  years, Burkina has been at the head of the countries of the West African Economic 
and  Monetary  Union  (WAEMU)  with  an  average  annual  growth  of  5.5%,  despite  a  number  of 
exogenous shocks. The Burkina economy is heavily dominated by agriculture, which employs close to 
80%  of  the  active  population.  Cotton  is  the  country's  most  important  cash  crop.  The  bulk  of  the 
greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector come from the categories of enteric fermentation 
and agricultural land. 

In 2007, the agricultural sector contributed 88% of the national GHG emissions. Animal husbandry, in 
the  form  of  enteric  fermentation activity,  is  the  category  that  contributes  the most  the  GHG  emission 
(almost  half  annually).  Agricultural  land  occupies  second  place  in  terms  of  contributions  to  these 
emissions.

Section 4. Adaptation projections and options 

4.1.  Burkina's long-term adaptation strategy 

Globally,  development  planning  is  based  on  the  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Growth  and  Sustainable 
Development (SAGSD). From the beginning, Burkina Faso's economy has been based on the primary 
sector,  the  sector  most  exposed  over  the  past  40  years  to  the  effects  of  climate  variability  and  the 
sector  that  is  now  considered  the  one  to  be  most  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  This  is  why  the 
government of Burkina Faso has become engaged specifically with issues of climate change since the 
great  droughts  of  the  1970's,  through  a  sustained  action  against  the  desertification  that  severely 
impacts the rural world.  

In  2014,  within  the  National  Partnership  Program  for  Sustainable  Land  Management,  Burkina  Faso 
has  developed  and  validated  a  Strategic  Framework  for  Investment  in  Sustainable  Land 
Management (SFI-SLM). The vision  in regard to Sustainable Land Management (SLM),  which takes 
the year 2025 as its projection horizon, is as follows: "Sustainable rural production systems which, by 
taking  into  consideration  local  knowledge  and  know-how,  (i)  preserve  the  fertility  of  the  soil,  (ii) 
increase plant and animal productivity per unit of area in use and/or by volume of water consumed, (iii) 
improve  the  well-being  of  the  people  living  on  the  land  and  (iv)  restore  preserve  the  integrity  and 
functioning of ecosystems."  

Considered  as  an  action  plan  of  the  NRSP  in  the  area  of  Sustainable  Management  of  Natural 
Resources (SMNR), the SFI-SLM is supported by all of the programmes and actions within the NRSP 
that are financed or are seeking financing.  

The  objectives,  results  and  outputs  expected  from  the  SFI-SLM  broadly  coincide  with  the  themes 
classified  as  priority  within  the  National  Adaptation  Plan  (NAP).  Because  it  has  defined  quantitative 
goals for the country at the 2025 horizon in the sectors of the GDRN, as well as their costs, the SFI-
SLM  may  be  considered  as  an  operational  action  plan  for  adaptation  in  the  sectors  of  agriculture, 
animal husbandry, forests and land use, water management and biomass energy.  

4.2.  Strategic adaptation objectives 

The greatest concern for Burkina Faso, as for any other country, is that the climate changes foreseen for 
the next 50  years are now inevitable. Hence, the primary interest of Burkina Faso, which is not a large 
GHG emitter, must necessarily be improvement of the people's capability to adapt to the conditions that 
will exist from now to 2025, 2030 or 2050: a significant rise in the average temperature, more severe dry 
seasons,  strongly  and  less  predictable  rainy  seasons,  a  growing  problem  of  drought,  lowering  of  the 
groundwater  table  and  an  increase  in  the  frequency  of  certain  diseases.  The  only  scenario  to  be 
prepared for is the trend situation, "business as usual", because the climate effects which Burkina must 
confront have already begun and the positive effects of the possible  mitigation actions to be envisaged 
from  this  point  forward,  either  at  the  local  or  global  level,  will  not  be  felt  until  after  the  period  of 
applicability of the INDC (2030). 

The objectives of the adaptation measures foreseen in the country's NAP (National  Adaptation Plan) 
are to (i) reduce the  vulnerability to the impacts of climate change on the  development of adaptation 
and  resilience  capabilities,  (ii)  facilitate  the  coherent  integration  of  adaptations  to  climate  change  in 
policies,  programmes  or  activities,  new  or  already  existing, in the  specific  processes  of  development 
planning and in the strategies of the relevant sectors at different levels. 

4.3.  Sectors involved in adaptation projects 

On  the  basis  of  the  adaptation  actions  identified  in  the  National  Adaptation  Plan  for  the  principal 
sectors vulnerable to climate change, national experts (from the public sector, the civil society and the 
private sector) participating in a kick-off and consultation  workshop for the present study  were asked 
to classify those actions that they consider of high priority in view of their knowledge of the country's 

Page 10 

Framework contract No 2015-AC-001-15DDU0C006-CPDN-Support Facility-Burkina Faso

environmental  and  socioeconomic  context.  Since  the  classification  exercise  is  at  the  same  time 
individual  and collective,  it  is  assumed  that  an  action  receiving the support  of more  than  50%  of  the 
participants  could  be  considered  to  be  of  significant  importance.  The  results  of  this  exercise  are 
presented in the following table.

4.4.  Selected adaptation actions by concerned sector 

It  is  useful  to  note  that  the  themes  given  a  priority  classification  by  the  experts  participating  in  the 
consultation workshop almost completely match the objectives and actions developed and proposed in 
the Strategic Investment Framework for Sustainable Land Management (SIF-SFM) (see 4.1).  

Table  9  below,  based  on  the  scaling  model  of  Sustainable  Land  Management  technologies  (CILSS, 
2015), summarises the adaptation actions  proposed  in the INDC for the sectors of agriculture,  water 
management, animal husbandry, biomass energy, forests and land use changes in general (AFOLU). 

They  incorporate  the  transversal  actions  associated  in  particular  with  adaptive  research  within  these 
sectors. 

As to table 10, it shows adaptation actions in sectors or areas such as: 

*  Housing and urban development. 

*  Health. 

*  Management of extreme climatic events. 

The basic data serving as the input for the model come from the reviewed relevant documentation that 
is available or has been provided by the national experts of the competent ministries. 

Annex 2 provides details on the adaptation projects proposed for the INDC.

Section 5. Socioeconomic analysis of INDC projects 

5.1.  Economic and financial options for mitigation and adaptation projects 

The adaptation and mitigation options in the case of a developing country such as Burkina Faso are a 
complex function of multiple factors, the most important of which are: (i) the cost of technology, (ii) the 
ease  of  applying  or  adopting  the  technology,  (iii)  the  social  benefit  and  (iv)  the  abundance  of  the 
consumption factor (or raw materials that can be used by technology). 

Since  the  financial  factor  is  the  constraining  determinant,  in  particular  for  investment  projects  of  a 
nature  that  is  more  social  than  economic,  the  analysis  of  the  implementation  of  mitigation  and 
adaptation  projects  places  greater  emphasis  on  cost  factors  (implementation of  the  technology)  than 
on other factors.  

Thus, a country such as Burkina Faso, so long as the mitigation constraints are not too high (as is the 
case  for  developed  countries  with  high-intensity  emissions),  must  gauge  its  projects  by  the  order  of 
increasing project implementation costs.  

Hence, three options are possible: 

*  Option 1: Mitigation and adaptation projects that can be carried out at negative cost. 

*  Option 2: Policies/measures/projects that can be carried out at net negative or  zero cost, taking 

into consideration the associated social, economic and environmental benefits. 

*  Option  3:  Mitigation  projects  with  a  positive  cost  that  are  feasible  on  condition  of  receiving 

international assistance. 

5.1.1  Mitigation  and  adaptation  projects  that  can  be  carried  out  at  a  negative  cost 

(BaU scenario) 

Negative-cost projects are defined as investments that produce economies of scale sufficient to cover 
invested  capital,  maintenance,  operating  costs  and  interest  charges  throughout  the  life  cycle  of  the 
project. This option is desirable in all the mitigation and adaptation scenarios, but especially in 
the  BaU  (Business  as  Usual)  or  unconditional  scenarios,  because  of  the  certainty  that  each 
project that is invested in will give its investors a return, particularly where there is no outside 
support or where the investment is made through domestic borrowing. 

In  the  mitigation  area,  reforestation  and  stove  improvement  projects  can  generate  negative  costs. 
Indeed,  association  with the Carbon Fund  can  provide financial  benefits  that  may  compensate  for  or 
counterbalance the amounts invested to implement the projects, in such a way as to make the project 
costs negative. 

5.1.2  Policies/measures/projects that can be carried out at net negative or zero cost, 
taking  into  consideration  the  associated  social,  economic  and  environmental 
benefits (equivalent to the Unconditional Scenario) 

It  is  sometimes  difficult  to  determine  the  quantitative  and  monetary  benefits  of  a  social  policy.  The 
difficulty  of  extrapolating  social  or  environmental  gains  as  financial  gains  explains  the  difficulty  in 
understanding  negative or  zero  costs.  The projects  within  this option  have an  absolute financial 
value that is negative, but an overall absolute value that is zero or positive when one takes into 
account  the  economic  and  productive,  public  health  and  environmental  effects  that  they 
produce. Their implementation is optional in the context of the unconditional and current trend 
(BaU) scenarios. 

The  examples  of  obvious  interest  concern  the  "improved  cook  stove"  and  "advanced  cook  stove 
projects.  

Framework contract No 2015-AC-001-15DDU0C006-CPDN-Support Facility-Burkina Faso 

Page 23 

Burkina Faso INDC - Final INDC Report - Deliverable 7 

5.1.3  Mitigation  projects  with  a  positive  cost  that  are  feasible  on  condition  of 
international  assistance  (equivalent  to  the  Hybrid  Conditional 

receiving 
Scenario)  

These  projects,  the  principal  objective  of  which  is  generally  the  mitigation  and  reduction  of  GHG 
(MPD,  REDD+  NAMA  projects),  are  of  two  types  and  relate  to  investments  that  are  feasible  in  the 
context of the conditional (external financing) scenario: 

*  The  project  is  very  costly  and profitable at  a certain  scale because of  the  economies  of scale it 

will generate, but external support would be needed because of its high investment cost. 

*  The project is not financially profitable, but its economic, public health and environmental benefits 
are  significant  and  its  implementation  would  almost  necessarily  require  external  financial 
assistance because of its high cost. 

5.1.4  Relationships  between  economic  options  and  mitigation  and  adaptation 

options 

When investments in mitigation and adaptation projects are financially profitable, the country does not 
need an external contribution because the invested capital is going to be recovered and the investors 
will  get  back  their  investment.  This  type  of  project  is  to  be  financed  and  carried  out  in  a  BaU  or 
unconditional  scenario  through  financing  provided  by  the  central  government  along  with  its  local 
partners (including the private sector in the context of domestic borrowing). 

However,  if  a  project  is  not  financially  profitable  (but  nevertheless  has  enormous  socioeconomic 
impacts  or  co-benefits),  or  even  profitable  with  enormous  socioeconomic  impacts  or  co-benefits,  the 
investments will be made within the framework of a hybrid conditional scenario, i.e. the requirement for 
external or international support to finance the project. 

An example of the type of project within the framework of a conditional scenario, where the  financing 
requires external financial support, is the "improved cook stoves" project. 

Improved  cook  stoves  for  which  the  performance  varies  as  a  function  of  technological  innovations 
(improved cook stove or advanced cook stove), will yield more or less positive financial profitability as 
a function  of  their  use (households  or  producers).  In the  case of  household use  for  domestic  needs, 
the  profitability  is  less,  while  in  the  case  of  use  to  produce  dolo  (sorghum  beer),  the  profitability  is 
much greater. 

Nevertheless, in both modes of use, the impacts and co-benefits of using the improved cook stove are 
enormous: 

*  Use  of  the  improved  cook  stove  makes  it  possible  to  save  15%  to  45%  of  the  energy  used  in 
cooking,  depending  on  the  level  of  technology.  This  means  that  in  the  above  cases,  the 
destruction of biomass is 15% to 45% less, which is of broad large-scale significance. 

*  The cooking speed resulting from the use of an improved cook stove allows the user of the stove 
to save 50% to 75% of the original time devoted to cooking or producing dolo (depending on how 
much the improved cook stove is used). This means that the user of the cook stove can devote 
more  than  half  of  the  original  time  to  other  profitable  activities  and  thus  increase  his  or  her 
income. 

*  The use of improved cook stoves permits households and other users to reduce their exposure to 
respiratory diseases caused by smoke or the inhalation of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, as 
the  case  may  be.  Persons  previously  exposed  increase  their  health  "capital"  and  the  income 
previously devoted to health care is saved. 

Thus, because of the enormous associated benefits cited above, such projects are financed within the 
framework of a conditional scenario, with the need for external financial help.

5.2.  Operational methodology of the analysis 

5.2.1  Objectives  

The aims of the socioeconomic analysis of the options and project within the INDC are to: 

*  Determine the feasibility of the projects. 

*  Perform  an  analysis  of  the  total  impact  of  the  "green  development"  options  on  the  overall 

economic growth of the country. 

*  Make it possible to prioritise projects that are already identified and are going to be implemented. 

*  Define the indicators of project relevance. 

*  Determine the socioeconomic benefits and costs inherent in their implementation. 

*  Evaluate the effects and impacts of the potential projects that have been identified. 

*  Validate  the  relevance  of  the  identified  projects  for  purposes  of  planning,  financing  and 

implementation. 

*  Prepare  a  relative  analysis  of  the  net  cost-benefit  ratios  associated  with  optional  project 

technologies. 

The  analysis  is  carried  out  in two  phases  and is  based  on  all  the  projects  identified  in the mitigation 
and adaptation components: 

*  Definition of a general framework for assessing the projects, based on previously defined criteria 

and indicators. 

*  Analysis  of  the  financial  cost-benefit  ratios  and/or  the  socioeconomic  and  environmental  co-

benefits of the projects. 

In the case at hand, the analysis of the projects will be based in the OECD-DAC principles: relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability  and impacts. A cross analysis of INDC  project sectors/OECD-
DAC  criteria  will  make  it  possible  to  identify  a  certain  number  of  expected  indicators  for  which  the 
various viable and profitable projects should be significant. 

5.2.2  General framework of socioeconomic analysis of the projects 

The  general  framework  for  analysis  of  the  projects  emphasises  their  contributions  to  the  country's 
overall development: 

* 

* 

In  terms  of  the  project's  contribution  to  green  growth  and  the  maintenance  and  revitalisation  of 
the stock of natural resources capital by facilitating the processes of mitigation of GHG emissions 
and the adaptation of the population to climate change. 

In terms of the contribution of the projects to the creation of wealth (growth), the multiplication of 
national income and the reduction of poverty. 

*  And in terms of the ease of acquisition and ease of adoption of the technology and other inputs of 

the projects. 

For this purpose, the criteria identified in table 11 below will serve as analytical indicators of the overall 
contribution to development, evaluated on the basis of a weighted score of 0 to 100. 

For each of the three contributions mentioned above, a project will be graded from 1 to 10 on the basis 
of  its  strength  with respect  to that  contribution  and  will  be  given a  weighted  grade  between  100  and 
1000 on the basis of its relevance and effectiveness in terms of its overall contribution to development.

Operationally, the socioeconomic analysis of the projects will focus on linked evaluations: 

*  Of the rate of return on the financial investment in the projects. 

*  Of the projected social and economic benefits of the projects. 

*  Of  the  positive  or  negative  environmental  externalities  associated  with  implementation  of  the 

projects.

5.3.  Results  of  socioeconomic  analyses  and  implementation  of  conditional 

projects within the INDC 

5.3.1  Implementation costs and net co-benefits generated 

In distinction to investment  costs,  which represent  the costs  of  acquiring  all  of  the  productive capital 
(production  factors,  including  raw  materials)  of  the  production  units,  the  implementation  costs  of  the 
projects represent expenses for the operation and follow-up of the production units. 

The implementation costs of the project consist of: 

*  The costs of designing the projects (feasibility and design studies). 

*  The costs of operating the projects (administrative costs of operating the management unit of the 

various projects), including the costs of capacity building. 

*  The  costs  of  supporting  the  implementation,  including  any  costs  for  information,  education  and 

communication (IEC). 

*  The costs of project follow-up and evaluation. 

Here we consider that the implementation costs represent around 40% of the costs of a project. Table 
12 below provides an estimate of the implementation costs of the various projects by INDC sector.

Co-benefits associated with implementation of the sectoral projects 

> Annual growth in agricultural production, more specifically the amounts of cereals produced, leading in 
turn to an improvement in the levels of food security and the levels of farmer income, which reduces the 
incidence of poverty. 

> The  proposed  actions  make  it  possible  to  sequester  carbon  in  the  soil  (more  than  5,150  Gg  eq  CO2 
sequestered at the 2030 horizon), contributing to the restoration of degraded land and mitigation of the 
effects of climate warming, with the end result of preserving ecosystems and water resources. 

>  The  use  of  biodigesters  makes  it  possible  to  produce  compost  for  the  fertilisation  of  agricultural  land 
(things which increase agropastoral production and the income of the producers). This provides energy 
to rural households, contributing to an increase in their standard of living. 

> The use of biodigesters contributes to saving biomass energy because the stocks of wood used for the 

energy needed for cooking and lighting are saved. 

> Development of grazing areas will preserve biodiversity and the mobilisation of surface water, which up 

to now has been better developed in intensive animal production zones (IAPZ's). 

> The  use  of  improved  cook  stoves  will  make  it  possible  to  save  the  wood  energy  that  is  consumed  (in 
comparison to traditional cook stoves), and the associated speedier cooking will permit the household or 
preparer of the meals to save time and use it for other income producing work, so much so that it could 
be double counted as a financial benefit.  

> The use of improved cook stoves permits local and rural populations to improve their health (because of 
the respiratory diseases caused by the inhalation of carbon monoxide that they avoid). The households, 
and principally the women, can then save the costs incurred for health care. 

> Transformation of methane waste is an additional source of energy (as well as a new source of regular 

jobs) and the cities will be able to get rid of their wastes for the good of the population. 

> Forest investment are an invaluable contribution to agroforestry and the preservation of biodiversity and 

a suitable response to environmental degradation and climate warming. 

> Forest  projects,  even  in  disadvantaged  communities,  make  it  possible  to  harmoniously  combine 
preservation of the forests and agricultural development by emphasising agricultural crops in a dynamic 
of local income growth. 

> Projects  to  create  forests  and  develop  natural  forests  make  it  possible  to  conserve  soil  and  water,

with  important  social  and  economic  information  that  makes  it  possible  to  adapt  their  systems  of 
production and protect their persons, their means of subsistence and their products. 

> Actions to transfer climatic, meteorological and environmental monitoring technologies make it possible 
to  readjust  production  and  consumption  factors  as  a  function  of  climate  change  and  improve  the

5.4.  Sources and conditions of financing  

There are multiple sources for financing projects within the INDC.  

The  availability  of  financing  sources  will  depend  on  the  ability  of  Burkina  Faso  to  develop  active 
cooperation  with  financing  partners  and  institutions.  To  finance  adaptation  and  mitigation  projects, 
Burkina  Faso  could  rely  on  access  to  the  Green  Climate  Fund  (GCF)  and  on  the  availability  of  the 
Environmental Action Fund created by the government, provided that this fund conforms to the rules of 
transparency, neutrality and good governance that permit a GCF window to be created within them.  

The strengthening of bilateral relations with friendly countries and multilateral relations with institutions 
such as the World Bank, the European Union, the GEF, the UNDP, the UNEP, the ADB, the IDB, the 
BOAD, the ECOWAS or WAEMU, all potential financial partners for the various projects through funds 
already  in  place,  may  permit  Burkina  Faso  to  finance  these  projects  within  the  framework  of  climate 
change and international agreements and conventions. 

The Burkina Faso private sector will contribute a large part (almost 50% of the financing) on condition 
that the commercial banks are made aware of these types of financing.  

Burkina  Faso  supports  the  use  of  market  mechanisms  such  as  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism 
(CDM)  as  an  effective  monitoring,  reporting  and  verification  tool  for  mitigation  activities  and  an 
instrument  for  results-oriented  financing.  Thus,  Burkina  Faso  supports  the  use  of  certified  emission 
reduction  units  (CER's)  delivered  by  CDM  project,  programmes  and  activities  to  reach  the  pre-2020 
mitigation goals. Hence, payments for carbon such as to make this economically viable in the specific 
context  of  the  less  advanced  countries,  the  developing  countries  and  the  small  developing  island

states is a priority. To do this, the establishment of new accounting rules within the framework of the 
UNFCCC  is  necessary  to  guarantee  the  environmental  integrity  of  market  mechanisms  and  avoid 
double  counting.  These  accounting  rules  will  also  be  introduced  for  the  EIF  in  order  to  achieve  the 
required financial transparency.

Section 6.  Implementation and monitoring and evaluation of projects 

listed within the INDC 

6.1. 

Implementation system and actors  

The  implementation  of  the  projects  listed  within  the  INDC  will  require  the  establishment  of  an  INDC 
Coordination  Unit  to  report  to  the  SP-CONEDD.1  The  Coordination  Unit  will  be  responsible  for 
coordinating  and  supervising  (monitoring)  the  implementation  of  the  various  actions  identified  in  the 
INDC  and will consist of three technical entities: 

*  A  coordination  entity  responsible  for  scheduling  the  implementation  activities  of  the  various 

projects. 

*  A  Technical  Adaptation  Cell  that  will  be  concerned  with  coordinating  the  implementation  and 
follow-up of the adaptation projects and which could become a Designated National Authority for 
Adaptation (DNA-AD). 

*  A  Technical  Mitigation  Cell  that  will  be  concerned  with  coordinating  the  implementation  and 
follow-up  of  the  mitigation  projects  in  coordination  with  or  on  behalf  of  the  Burkina  Faso  DNA 
(Designated National Authority). 

The staff and experts within these units will cooperate closely with the staffs of the various ministries in 
charge of the projects, which are: 

*  The Ministry of Agriculture 

*  The Ministry of Water Resources 

*  The Ministry of Animal Resources 

*  The Ministry of Environment and Forests 

*  The  ministry  and  public  institutions  responsible  for  scientific  research  and  technological 

innovation 

*  The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development 

*  The Ministry of Health 

*  The Ministry of Energy 

*  The Ministry of Transportation 

The Coordination Unit will work with the above departments and other cross-cutting ministries, such as 
the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  the  Promotion  of Women  and  Gender  and  the 
Ministry of International Cooperation, within the framework of the financing agreements. Finally, it will 
coordinate with the civil society structures and the institutions representing the private sector. 

6.2.  Follow-up and evaluation system and actors 

The  Coordination  Unit  will  be  responsible  for  overall  follow-up  of  the  implementation  activities  of  the 
INDC2. For this purpose, it  will have to have  a manual of administrative  procedures and a harmonised 
system  of  follow-up  and  evaluation  of  the  projects,  detailing  the  principal  responsibilities  and  the 
objectives that have been assigned. 

The  project  evaluation actors  are  external  and  will  come from  the  technical  and financial  partners  of 
the projects to be implemented. These evaluations will take place annually or at given intervals and, at 
certain  stages  in  the  implementation  of  the  projects,  will  consider  the  work  of  the  independent 
evaluators. 

                                                      

1   According to the options for a national sustainable development policy, the CONEDD will evolve into a National Council for 

Sustainable Development (NCSD).  

2  Each  project  will  have  within  it  a  follow-up  and  evaluation  mechanism  using  tools  that  are  harmonised  (and  if  necessary 

standardised) with the other INDC projects.

Section 7. Conclusion 

In Burkina Faso's INDC, the mitigation and adaptation themes have been integrated, the two of them 
being  closely  linked:  to  "mitigate"  it  is  necessary  in  principle  to  "adapt"  since the  agriculture-forestry-
land use (AFOLU) sector is an emission sector but also a major sequestration sector. Consequently, 
adaptation  contributes  to  a  great  extent  to  mitigation  revenues  (CO2  sequestration  and  emissions 
avoided x the price per ton of carbon on the exchanges).  

However, adaptation necessitates substantial funding. Although the price per ton of CO2 has collapsed 
on  the  global  markets,  the  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  remains  an  excellent  indicator  of  the 
performance  and  impact  of  the  mitigation  programmes  and  projects  in  Burkina  Faso.  But  CO2  is  not 
the only source of life in Burkina Faso (food security, atmospheric pollution, air and water quality). One 
molecule of water (H2O) is just as vital to the soil as CO2 for food security and the life cycle chain. For 
adaptation, the conservation of water (H2O) (runoff water, groundwater etc.) is an adaptation indicator 
just  as  CO2  is  in  the  case  of  mitigation.  Therefore,  CO2  and  H2O  can  both  be  counted,  CO2  for  its 
market value and H2O for its economic value.  

In the case  of  mitigation  (approach and  results),  and  for  the  purpose of  reducing carbon emissions 
and  increasing  sequestration,  the  three  scenarios  are  clear  and  obvious.  The  issue  is  to  prioritise 
these  scenarios  by  linking  them  to  investments  in  adaptation,  clean  technology  and  projects  whose 
end objective is a society with low carbon emissions and a greener rural world.  

In the case of adaptation, the options are above all varied and it is also necessary to prioritise them in 
a  summary  table  based  on  mitigation  projections,  adaptation  options  and  the  investments  required. 
For example, adaptation in the area of water resource management is multi-sectoral, with initiatives to 
conserve this resource with regard to both quality and quantity. In addition, collection, recycling, reuse, 
water  treatment  technologies  and  innovative  schemes  for  water  efficiency  and  good  water 
management  would  aid  to  the  "clarity"  of  this  water.  Other  ideas  would  form  part  of  the  Strategic 
Framework  for  Investment  in  Sustainable Land  Management  (SFI-SLM),  with  a  budget  of  869  billion 
CFA francs for five years that is both ambitious and conservative. With one-third of the land degraded 
and  thus  9,316,000  ha  in  distress,  the  application  of  good  land  use  practices  and  the  sustainable 
management  of  land  are  also required, given  that these funds  affect  directly  the  people  who are  the 
most vulnerable (the users of these lands) and the fact that this activity directly attacks the problem of 
management of natural resources at all levels. Thus, developing an Integrated Adaptation Scenario for 
this INDC is ambitious.  

In  terms  of  co-benefits,  and  in  order  to  maximise  them,  the  regions  of  the  north  and  the  animal 
husbandry sector will need more attention and greater investments. Here also, as in the forests sector, 
the mitigation and adaptation actions operate both symbiotically and in parallel. 

Climate  change  will  amplify  their  impacts  where  there  is  already  population  pressure,  that  is  in  the 
heavily populated urban areas.  

The  G7  countries  have  committed  to  contribute  100  billion  dollars  per  year  from  now  to  2020  to  the 
fight against climate change, part of which is to pass through the Green Climate Fund (GCF). 

This  sum  promised  by  the  international  community  is  to  support  the  developing  countries  in  the 
limitation  of  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  their  adaptation  to  the  effects  of  climate  change. 
However,  this  commitment  does  not  cover  all  that  is  needed  to  finance  worldwide  reduction  of 
greenhouse gases, an amount estimated at between 650 billion and 1,950 billion US dollars per year.  
Burkina Faso through its INDC should position itself among the community of nations to have access 
to these funds.

Burkina Faso INDC - Final INDC Report - Deliverable 7 

In terms of financing, the Environmental Intervention Fund (EIF) established by Burkina Faso appears 
to be an excellent tool provided that the operating rules of this fund are flexible and transparent in a 
way to make it a tool of good governance. The income from emissions reductions could be paid into 
this  fund.  And  since  adaptation  is  at  the  heart  of  mitigation  and  gives  rise  to  it,  one  could  logically 
imagine  that  a  percentage  of  the  mitigation  revenues  would  be  mobilised  to  finance  the  adaptation 
options (up to 75%, for example), depending on the innovative mechanisms. One could also imagine 
more  broadly  that  a  percentage  of  the  EIF  (40%)  would  go  to  implement  adaptation  and  mitigation 
measures  (15%),  cutting-edge  follow-up  and  evaluation/certification  technologies  (15%)  and  applied 
research (10%, for example). 

From the beginning, Burkina Faso's INDC was intended to be participative, particularly workshops 1 
to  3  and  the  ad  hoc  working  group,  robust,  fair,  ambitious  and  transparent,  not  to  mention  other 
qualifiers. 

The  INDC  is  robust  because  of  its  range  of  data,  multiple  analyses,  summary  tables  and  in-depth 
thinking on the environment, climate change, mitigation and adaptation, and social and socioeconomic 
areas and in the scenarios that give meaning to such thinking. 

To be fair and engender fairness, the INDC was intended to demonstrate to the community of nations 
that, despite this country's low emissions of carbon and GHG in comparison to worldwide emissions, 
Burkina  Faso  assumes  responsibility  for  the  emissions  it  emits,  particularly  in  the AFOLU  sector.  To 
do  this,  despite  the  fact  the  cost  of  reducing  emissions  and  the  ratio  of  investment  cost  to  benefit 
(health, social  benefits,  food security)  are  high  in  Burkina,  the  government  fully  intends  to undertake 
major mitigation actions in the energy sector and adaptation actions in the rural sector and the sectors 
of  health  and  housing  in  order  to  help  reduce  its  emissions,  while  significantly  reducing  the 
vulnerability of the strategic sectors of its economy. 

The  INDC  is  ambitious  because  it  goes  beyond  the  BaU  scenario  and  moves  toward  two  other 
scenarios,  Unconditional  and  Hybrid  Conditional  that  integrate  mitigation  with  adaptation.  In  the 
Unconditional  Scenario,  Burkina  explores  new  targets  and  presses  hard  for  the  mitigation 
opportunities  that  the  country  would  be  expected  to  have  if  it  took  the  technical  and  economic 
measures necessary to achieve ambitious economic growth to follow an upward curve that has still not 
been achieved in all sectors of development. In this Hybrid Conditional Scenario, Burkina Faso moves 
toward  sustainable  development.  And  the  Integrated  Adaptation  Scenario  lends  itself  well  to 
transforming  the  resource  consumption  economy  of  Burkina  Faso  into  a  gradually  green  (or  almost 
green) economy and into a society with low carbon emissions. In this scenario, it is estimated that the 
total  value  of  the  environmental  services  provided  by  the  actions  that  are  proposed  in  the  AFOLU 
sectors over the 15 years up to 2030 would be at least US $11,500,000,000, which would give a return 
on  investment  of more  than 400%  (which,  when  compared  with the  solely  financial  return  of  primary 
production  of  64%,  is  six  times  greater).  These  environmental  services,  although  invisible  in  a 
consumption  economy  measured  in  GDP,  are  real  in  a  circular  or  natural  capital  economy  and 
contribute greatly to the national economy. 

While being fair and ambitious, the INDC aims to be transparent and aspires to reach the objectives of 
the Climate Convention by aligning itself with the 2°C objective and taking into consideration the need to 
limit  cumulative emissions  over  this  period  to  almost  zero.  Once  again,  this  objective is  ambitious  and 
requires total transparency. Technically and economically, this means for Burkina Faso an economy with 
low carbon output (a  low carbon emission society) and a country covered  with green and  with a green 
economy. With  its  semi-arid  nature  and  climate  conditions  that  are  still  more  uncertain  in  the  years  to 
come,  this  transformation  will  demand  considerable  efforts  and  huge  investments  in  adaptation, 
particularly  in  the  agriculture-forests-land  use  (AFOLU)  sectors.  The  adaptation  solutions  exist  to  help 
the population foresee and prepare to face the effects of climate change that will inevitably arise because 
of the GHG emissions that have already taken place since 1900.

As  it  turns  out,  many  adaptation  actions  rely  on  clean  technologies  that  in  turn  contribute  to  the 
lowering  of  GHG  emissions.  The  most  important  are  connected  with  land  management  and  the 
conservation of  water,  soil  and forests  in order  to  increase the resilience of  the  population. It  is  thus 
important that the government, its partners and international donors support these initiatives and make 
possible,  through  reasonable  and  proper  investments,  their  greatest  possible  spread  throughout  the 
country.

Section 8. Commitments / recommendations 

Burkina Faso's commitment comes about through three scenarios. 

A  first  scenario,  Unconditional  (annex  1),  the  objective  of  which  is  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  by 
7,808  Gg  per  year  in  2030,  i.e.  6%  when  compared  to  BaU,  for  ongoing  investments  of  US  $1.25 
billion. 

A  Hybrid  Conditional  scenario  (annex  1),  which  aims  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  by  11.6%,  which 
corresponds to 13,766 Gg per year in 2030, for investments of US $756,032,667. 

A  third  scenario,  Adaptation  (annexe  2),  which  aims,  among  other  things,  to  restore  and  develop 
5,055 million ha of degraded lands at the 2030 horizon, corresponding to 55% of the total current area 
of degraded lands in the country and making it possible to feed more than 6 million additional persons 
at  the  2030  horizon.  Moreover,  these  adaptation  projects  will  contribute  to  a  reduction  in  GHG 
emissions of 43,707 Gg of CO2, i.e. 36.95% when compared to BaU, for an overall investment of US 
$5,804,949,915.  

The recommendations may be summarised as:  

*  Guarantee  the  use  of  the  Environmental  Intervention  Fund,  the  financial  transparency  of  which 
will  be  beyond  question,  to  receive  and  distribute  the  receipts  from  the  sale  of  carbon  resulting 
from mitigation. 

*  Clearly  promote  renewable  energy,  at  least  by  eliminating  fossil  fuel  subsidies  and,  at  best,  by 

subsidising investments in renewable energy. 

*  Promote  architectural  structures  that  use  materials  that  are  local,  renewable  and  insulating  and 
have  a  low  energy  cost  for  all  public  construction  and,  through  subsidies  and  tax  breaks,  for 
private residences. 

* 

In  the  agricultural  sector  at  large,  move  resolutely  toward  sustainable  and  adapted  agricultural 
practices, particularly for family operations and small producers. 

*  For the large private and public farms, review the value chain in terms of climate change and, in 
particular, evaluate in the most rigorous and complete way  the  new biotechnology programmes, 
especially GMO's.
