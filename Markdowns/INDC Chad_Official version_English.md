Section 2.  National circumstances 
Chad, a landlocked sub-Saharan country, lacking a coastline, covers a surface area of 1,284,000 km2, the 
majority of which is desert. The country's main economic activities are those associated with the primary 
sector, such as subsistence agriculture, livestock rearing and fishing. Despite the oil industry being relative 
new, with exports only having started in 2004, it is already booming. An oil refinery, which opened in 2011, 
meets domestic demand for oil products. 

Table 1.Key data for 2010 (reference year)

Population 

Three climate zones: Saharan, Sahelian and Sudanian 

11,679,974 inhabitants (2nd National Census, 2009 including refugees), 
of which 21.9% live in urban areas and 46.4% are of working age. The 
natural rate of growth is 3.6% per year 

GDP 

5,249.6 billion FCFA

Rate of access to drinking water

Over the last ten years, Chad's Saharan and Sahelian zones have spread 150 km south. This has resulted 
in reduced farming and pasture areas, which, in turn, has lead livestock rearers and farmers to move to 
more suitable areas to work, leading, in general, to a reinforcement of existing inequality and discrimination 
amongst certain populations. Likewise, Lake Chad has reduced in size from 25,000 km² in 1960 to 2,500 
km² today. This reduction has considerably impacted upon crop and fish production, and forced inhabitants 
to move to wetter areas. 

With the increase in oil exploitation, exporters of agro-pastoral products have lost ground to oil exporters, 
with oil representing 88% of exports in 2010, against 6% for livestock, 2% for cotton fibre and 4% for other 
products. 

The state of the National Electricity Company's (SNE), production facilities exclusively thermal, explains 
the high cost of electricity production, which represents an obstacle to the competitiveness in the Chadian 
economy, in particular in terms of industrial and commercial activity. The absence of an interconnected 
national  grid  makes  economical  pooling  of  the  energy  generated  impossible,  instead  favouring  the 
proliferation of isolated and onerous production facilities to supply the different cities across the country, 
which makes electricity expensive. 

In line with its Government policy guidelines for development, Chad aspires to become an emerging country 
by  2030.  In  this  regard,  the  Government  intends,  amongst  other  things,  to  reinforce  environmental 
protection, GHG emissions mitigation measures and adaptation actions in respect of climate change. 

 

Page 2 

INDC Chad 

The issue of environment protection is enshrined in articles 47 and 52 of the Constitution of Chad, and Act 
N°014/PR/1998 defines the general principles for protecting the environment. In 1992, Chad signed the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was ratified on 30 April 1993. 
Since then, the country has produced the Initial and Second National Communications relating to climate 
change, in accordance with the relevant UNFCCC provisions. This demonstrates Chad's desire to make 
an  effective  contribution  to  the  global  effort  to  combat  global  warming,  to  which  the  country  is  highly 
vulnerable given the fragility of its ecosystems and its economy, which is highly dependent on sectors that 
are sensitive to climate change. 

In the face of development  challenges, Chad is ready  to fight  against climate change and adapt to  its 
impacts  by  making  efforts  to  protect  the  environment,  in  particular  through  activities  such  as  planting 
thousands of trees each year and implementing the national programme for the development of green belts 
around Chadian cities. In addition to these green belts, ten million trees are being planted as part of the 
African Great Green Wall initiative, and National Tree Week has been officially launched. Chad has also 
established a Special Fund for the  Environment (FSE) in 2013, in order to mobilise  its own resources 
through the establishment of specific taxes. 

Under this INDC, Chad intends to reaffirm its determination to contribute to the global effort to reduce GHG 
emissions and reinforce its resilience to climate change, implementing coherent programmes which will 
enable it to become an emerging country by 2030, whilst favouring low-carbon development, as far as 
possible with the means available. The largest challenge to overcome is the move, between now and 2030, 
from a development model based on oil revenue, to a model based on a more diversified economy with 
sustainable utilisation of resources and an energy transition. 
Chad supports the Lima summit's call for action on climate change, as cited in the decision 1/CP.20, which 
called  for  each  Party  country  to  establish  a  nationally  determined  contribution  in  order  to  achieve  the 
Convention's objective. Chad's contribution is based on measures and results.

Section 3.  Adaptation 

Impacts and vulnerability 

The impacts of climate change are significant on the large hydrographic systems of the basins of Lakes 
Chad and Niger: natural, agro-silvo-pastoral, fishery and human systems. They include changes to the 
agricultural  seasons,  disturbances  in  the  biological  cycles  of  crops  and  a  reduction  in  cereal  crop 
production. Depending on the geographic zone, climate change exposes certain sectors and social groups 
to a medium to high level of vulnerability (1 = very high, 6 = lower), according to the NAPA and consultations 
carried out during the workshop launching the INDC preparation process. 
•  Saharan Zone 

-  Sectors: 1) livestock, 2) agriculture, 3) trade, 4) natural resources, 5) water 
-  Groups: 1) The sick, 2) isolated elderly people, 3) women and children, 4) disabled heads of family, 

5) displaced persons 

•  Sahelian Zone 

-  Sectors: 1) water resources, 2) agriculture, 3) livestock, 4) fishing, 5) gathering, 6) handicrafts, 8) 

forestry 

-  Groups: 1) women and children, 2) isolated elderly people, 3) the sick, 4) displaced persons and 

refugees, 5) returning persons 

•  Sudanian Zone 

-  Sectors: 1) water resources, 2) agriculture, 3) livestock, 4) fishing, 5) fishery resources, 6) forestry 
-  Groups: 1) women and children, 2) isolated elderly people, 3) displaced persons, 4) refugees, 5) 

rural populations, 6) returning persons2 

National priorities in terms of adaptation to climate change 

Whilst the actions are applicable to all of Chad, it appears that the priority target zones (Kanem, Barh El 
Ghazal, Batha, Guéra, Hadjer Lamis, Wadi Fira; Ouaddai, Dar Sila, Lac, Moyen-Chari, Borkou, Tibesti, 
Ennedi Est, Ennedi Ouest) are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change and, in part, to the 
arrival of displaced populations. There are approx. 700,000 displaced people in Chad, including refugees 
and Chadians returning from Sudan, the Central African Republic, Nigeria and Libya (OCHA, 2015).  
•  Cross-cutting priorities: 

-  Reinforce the capacities of the stakeholders (farmers, fishermen and livestock rearers) and their 

- 

- 

revenue-generating activities; 
Improve  production  techniques  by  developing  water  infrastructure,  access  to  improved  and 
adapted inputs(food crop and fodder seeds, animal gene banks, manure management, compost 
management, etc.), develop storage and conservation units to limit high post-harvest losses; 
Inform,  educate  and  communicate  information  relating  to  climate  risk,(improve  the  observatory 
used to forecast meteorological events and develop the population's ability to react in the event of 
a catastrophe); 

-  Create an observatory for policies for adapting to climate change; 
- 
Improve the seasonal forecast of precipitation and surface runoff; 
-  Manage climate risks. 

•  Priorities by sector (NAPA, 2009 and June 2015 Workshop): 

-  Water: manage water through the creation and development of agricultural irrigation structures 
including retention ponds, irrigated perimeters,  artificial lakes, and the application of Integrated 
Water Resources Management (IWRM) and Water Governance 

                                                      
2  A = supplements indicated during working groups "adaptation launch workshop, 15 June 2015" 

 

Page 4 

INDC Chad 

-  Agriculture: develop intensive and diverse cultivation, using improved inputs, (organic fertilisers 
including  composts,  adapted  plant  varieties),  agroforestry,  land  and  water  conservation, 
(implementation  of  soil  restoration  works)  and  preparation  and  distribution  of  new  cropping 
calendars 
Livestock: securing pastoralism and transhumance through common  grazing  zones, as  well as 
creating and popularising fodder banks and crossbreeding of animal species 

- 

-  Fish: development of enclosed fish farming areas 

The cost of national priorities, in terms of adaptation to climate change, are met on the one hand by the 
National Investment Plan for the Rural Sector (PNISR), covering the period 2014 - 2020 and validated in 
2014, and on the other by the meeting held by the Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA) in March 2015, 
which put forward the Country Resilience Priorities (PRP) AGIR CHAD for implementation by 2020, which 
would help approx. 6.5 million people escape food and nutritional insecurity. 

The PNISR, using an initial amount of 2,301.7 billion CFA francs for the period 2014-2020, estimate that, 
by 2030, by applying an annual population growth rate of 3.6% and an annual inflation rate of 2.9% 3, this 
amount will be 4,321 billion CFA francs. The overall cost of the AGIR CHAD PRP will be 775 billion CFA 
francs for a period of 5  years until 2020. By 2030, the total necessary funding to implement the INDC 
adaptation component would be 14.170 billion USD, in order to establish development resilient to climate 
change. 

Current and planned initiatives to support adaptation 

On the national level, the initiatives to support adaptation have just started within the National Adaptation 
Programme of Action for Climate Change (NAPA adopted in2009), in particular with financing by the EU 
(~5.26 billion CFA francs or 8 million Euros through the AMCC -Global Climate Change Alliance project-) 
for the following priority projects: 
•  Development of intensive and diversified crops that are adapted to extreme climate risks 
•  Soil restoration and defence against degradation caused by climate change 
• 

Improvement  of  intercommunity  grassland  areas,  in  order  to  reduce  migratory  movements  due  to 
climate change 

•  National Agency for the Great Green Wall 

In addition to these, adaptation will be supported by the 11th European Development Fund for the period 
2014-2020.  This  foresees  the  provision  of  297  million  euros  for  "rural  development,  nutrition  and  food 
safety", and an amount of 53 million euros for "sustainable management of natural resources". 
Finally, adaptation is supported by the Project to Improve the Resilience of Agricultural Systems in Chad 
(PARSAT). The PARSAT with total funding of 36.2 million USD, co-funded by IFAD, GEF, ASAP and the 
Chadian government was put in place in 2015, for a period of 7 years. 
At a regional level, there are: 
•  The Lake Chad basin sustainable development programme (PRODEBALT with funding from ADB) 
•  The nutrition and food insecurity resilience reinforcement programme in the Sahel (P2RS, based on 

African Development Funds amounting to 15 million USD) 

•  The Project in Support of the Lake Chad Basin initiative to reduce vulnerability and the risks associated 

with STIs/HIV/AIDS (PAIBLT, ADB) 

•  The  regional  "Adaptation  to  climate  change  in  the  Lake  Chad  Basin"  project  (German  Ministry  for 
International  Cooperation 

Economic  Development  and  Cooperation/Federal  Enterprise 
cooperation) covering the period 2013-2018 

for 

•  The Lake Chad preservation project: contribution to the Lake development strategy (GEF-ADF)

•  The regional programme to reinforce the resilience of countries in the Sahel (26 million US, IDB) 

Gaps and barriers 

Gaps: 
•  Poor understanding of the concept of climate change by the vast majority of society 
• 
•  Lack of involvement from women 

Illiteracy 

Barriers: 
•  Poor integration of policies relating to climate change into national and sectoral policies 
•  Besides the Directorate-General of Meteorology and the Directorate leading the Fight Against Climate 

Change, there is no other climate governance structure 

•  Poor livelihood capacity, (physical, national, social, institutional, etc.) of communities 
•  Slow implementation of measures 
•  Failure to consider climate change in the general State budget 
• 

Insufficient international funding 

Summary of adaptation needs 

In  order  to  reduce  vulnerability  and  increase  resilience,  adaptation  needs  include  the  reinforcement  of 
human, institutional and technical capacities, as well as financial support and technology transfer. 

Needs for reinforcement of human and institutional capacity: 
• 

Inform,  educate  and  communicate  information  regarding  climate  risks  and  adaptation  technologies 
(develop the population's ability to react) 

•  Reinforce stakeholder attitudes, (in particular in relation to women and farmers), with regards to new 

techniques in terms of intensive and sustainable methods of production 

•  Support research and encourage the transfer of technology between research bodies and agro-silvo-

pastoral stakeholders 

•  Support  institutions  in  defining  adaptation  priorities,  for  each  socio-economic  sector,  based  on  the 
needs of the population and favouring coherence between sectors, in particular during the preparation 
of the National Adaptation Plan

Assumptions and methodology 

Methodology 

The accounting method for GHG  inventory in each sector is  the same as  that  used in the IPCC 2006 
Guidelines on national GHG inventories. The values used, with regards to the Global Warming Potential 
(GWP) for the different greenhouse gases, are those published in Appendix 3 of Decision 24, adopted by 
the Conference of the Parties during their 19th meeting between the 11th and 23rd November 2013. Energy 
demand projections for 2030 are based on the Blueprint for Chad's energy sector. For the waste sector, 
the  projections  reflect  the  demographic  and  migratory  forecasts  published  by  the  National  Institute  of 
Statistics for Economic and Demographic Studies (INSEED). In  the calculations of GHG gases for the 
agriculture, livestock, land use and forestry sectors, in the absence of national data, the values published 
by the statistical division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) are 
used.  The  reference  scenario  was  built  considering  the  assumptions  cited  in  the  vision  and  strategy 
documents in place in Chad, in particular: 
• 
•  ECCAS 2025 strategic vision on the environment 
•  ECCAS General Environment and Natural Resources Management Policy 
•  Order No. 89 PR/PM/MAE/SG/DGE/2015 relating to the establishment of a Core Working Group (GTR) 

"Vision 2030, The Chad we want" 

responsible for preparing Chad for the COP 21 

•  Chad Energy Sector Blueprint 
•  Five-year Agricultural Development Plan for Chad (2013-2018) 
•  National Development Plan 2013-2015 
•  National Livestock Development Plan (2009-2016) 
•  Food Security Profile 
•  National Poverty Reduction Strategy document 
•  The Niamey declaration on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) for the agricultural, 

livestock and forestry sectors in April 2015 

•  Project to Improve the Resilience of Agricultural Systems in Chad (PARSAT), launched in 2015 
•  Regional Programme for the Promotion of Household and Alternative Energies in the Sahel (PREDAS) 
•  National Food and Nutrition Policies 2014-2025 

Carbon offsets 

As a Non-Annex I Party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 
Least Developed Countries (LDC), the Republic of Chad does not intend to appeal to the international 
carbon markets in order to compensate for its own emissions. The country hopes, by contrast, to encourage 
investment  in  mitigation  projects  on  its  own  territory,  notably  by  means  of  the  Clean  Development 
Mechanism  (CDM)  and  the  REDD+  programme.  These  initiatives  must  particularly  focus  on  sharing 
benefits  with  the  local  population,  for  example  in  terms  of:  (i)  access  to  sustainable  energy  for  all  (ii) 
generation of local jobs, (iii) reducing impact on health and on the environment, (iv) reducing inequalities, 
including gender-based inequality and (v) respecting human rights.

Accounting / verification system 

The monitoring and assessment system will entail quantifying GHG emissions on a national level, as well 
as  their  evolution  over  time,  with  the  aim  of  periodically  providing  robust  data  reflecting  the  country's 
progress  with  regards  to  mitigation  and  sustainable  development.  A  measurement,  reporting  and 
verification system (MRV) must be drawn up, with the aim of being precise but also simple. In order to 
reduce inherent institutional, technical, political and financial risks, it will be necessary to reinforce technical 
capacity,  as  well  as  research  and  stakeholder  coordination,  in  order  to  carry  out  this  activity.  Chad 
encourages  the  Parties  cited  in  Annex  I  of  the  Convention  to  technically  and  financially  support  the 
establishment of follow-up and assessment initiatives in Chad. 

Institutional arrangements for implementation 

Implementing mitigation actions and reaching the GHG emission limitation objectives set out in Chad's 
INDC include aspects which are conditional on the availability of international support in terms of funding, 
technology  transfer  and  reinforcement  of  capacity.  To  prepare  and  implement  mitigation  projects,  the 
country intends to request international aid from different available sources, in particular from agencies for 
development  assistance,  bilateral  and  multilateral  financial  institutions,  UNFCCC  financial  mechanisms 
(Green Fund for the climate, adaptation funds, GEF etc.) and the private sector. Funding needs have been 
estimated at approx. 21.233 billion US$. Implementation of Chad's INDC will place particular emphasis on 
better taking account of human rights and equality between the sexes. 

Ambitious and fair nature of the intended contribution 

Limiting the growth of GHG emissions represents, in itself, a great challenge for Chad, considering national 
circumstances. In economic terms, Chad is classed amongst the Least Developed Countries (LDC), having 
a GDP per inhabitant of 676 USD. 

Chad suffers significant structural vulnerabilities, due in particular to the country's isolation and its exposure 
to natural and climatic hazards. According to statistics from the United Nations, Chad has an Economic 
Vulnerability Index of 52.8, compared to an average of 45.7 in 2012 among all of least developed countries. 
In the face of these developmental challenges, the contribution from the Republic of Chad is ambitious, as 
it establishes an allowance of 2314.66 GgCO2e, on average, per year for 15 years, for the unconditional 
scenario. This objective will be achieved by various means, including increasing the renewable electricity 
supply from 0 to 750 GWh/year in 15 years, i.e. to a level equivalent to double the current total national 
production  for  all  sectors  included  and  introducing/reinforcing  sustainable  practices  in  the  waste 
management, agriculture, livestock, land use and forestry sectors. 

The established contribution is also fair as GHG emissions per inhabitant in Chad are around 0.732 tCO2e, 
placing  them  amongst  the  lowest  in  the  world.  In  line  with  the  unconditional  objective,  emissions  per 
inhabitant in 2030 will be 1.028 tCO2e, whereas they would be just 0.364 tCO2e if means are acquired to 
enable the country to reach the conditional objective of a 71% reduction. 

Chad intends to achieve this established contribution whilst pursuing its development objectives and using 
its available resources in a sustainable manner.
