"Climate change deepens inequalities and multiplies threats. It is our 
obligation to address this problem before its consequences become 
irreversible. Future generations will judge us not only for the growth 
of our economy and its social impacts, but also for our capacity to 
face the climate change challenge"

Michelle Bachelet, President of Chile.

PROLOGUE

Chile has positioned itself in the internatio-
nal arena as a country that seeks to support 
strong climate action. We are convinced that 
strong and consistent signals must be provi-
ded in order to secure the necessary agree-
ments  to  address  the  challenge  of  climate  
change.

Achieving  this  position  meant  taking  lea-
dership as a country to facilitate - and pio-
neer - the operation of international carbon 
markets. In recent years this has been confir-
med through the  generation of a portfolio 
of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions 
(NAMAs), an unprecedented carbon tax that 
will take effect in 2017, the recently updated 
Biennial Report presented at the COP20, and 
the national and sector specific adaptation 
plans approved by the Chilean Governmen-
t´s Committee of Ministers for Sustainability 
and Climate Change. 

In  this  context,  Chile  faced  the  challenge 
of  preparing  a  robust  and  coherent  Inten-
ded  Nationally  Determined  Contribution 
(INDC) that would consider a comprehensive 
approach to address the various facets of cli-
mate change affecting the country.

gy transfer and development pillars as well 
as climate finance.
Chile  undertook  the  process  of  preparing 
its INDC as an opportunity to systematica-
lly  work  on  climate  management  from  an 
inter-ministerial public policy approach. The 
INDC  draft  was  first  prepared  by  experts 
from a group of ministries and then submit-
ted to a four month formal public consulta-
tion process. Chile´s final INDC was ratified 
by the Committee of Ministers for Sustaina-
bility and Change Climate. This process de-
monstrates the true vocation of the Chilean 
government to work in coordination to ad-
dress the climate challenge.

Through its INDC, Chile wants to materialize 
a formal expression of interest not only by 
contributing  to  mitigation  and  adaptation, 
but  also  by  highlighting  contributions  in 
other areas of the international climate ma-
nagement agenda.

In particular, we are collaborating in the de-
velopment  of  South-South  joint  actions  to 
support the building and strengthening of 
climate capacities for coordinated action by 
the Convention. We are preparing strategies 
related to climate technology transfer along 
with national climate finance.

Chile´s INDC is built on three key areas: "Re-
silience  to  climate  change",  including  the 
pillars of Adaptation and Capacity Building; 
"Control of greenhouse gas emissions", com-
prising the Mitigation pillar; and "cross-su-
pport for climate action", including technolo-

Through  the  development  of  these  impor-
tant tools in the coming years and the adop-
tion a long-term approach, we will be better 
prepared to systematically address the cha-
llenges posed by climate change to countries 
around the world.

NATIONAL CONTEXT

Chile  is  highly  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  Climate  Change. The 
country's low coastline, the snow and glacier regime of its rivers, the 
forests which Chile is trying to protect and restock, its ocean waters 
-which supply the fishing industry, a key resource for the country- are 
all encompassed within the 9 criteria set forth by Article 4 of the Uni-
ted Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 

Along the same lines, the 5th Report of the Intergovernmental Pa-
nel on Climate Change1 highlights the severe impacts faced by the 
country's resources and ecosystems, particularly by its fishing, aqua-
culture, forestry, livestock and farming sectors, water resources, and 
biodiversity, , as well as its temperature and rainfall levels. These vul-
nerabilities and impacts have also been documented in the national 
communications2 to the UNFCCC Secretariat and are being duly in-
corporated to the National Climate Change Action Plan3.  
   
In addition, Chile suffers from other non-environmental vulnerabili-
ties. In the last decade, mining has averaged 57% of total national ex-
ports, with copper accounting for almost all of them. This shows that 
Chilean exports are strongly concentrated on primary goods, whose 
prices, being commodities, are highly dependent on the fluctuations 
of international markets.
 
Chile's vulnerability is also heightened by its technological needs, in-
cluding those required to mitigate and adapt to Climate Change, as a 
result of a still partial absorption of technology transfer and the low 
incentives to Research and Development. Furthermore, the current 
average cost of electricity for Chileans is one of the highest among 
OECD countries.

On the other hand, our economy is still at the mercy of the interna-
tional market, given its high level of economic integration, both in 
commercial and financial terms, which exposes it to external tur-
moil. Despite all of the above, the soundness of public funding and 
the financial standing of the Government, as well as the credibility

attained by the country during the years of application of economic 
policy based on the Structural Balance Rule, has allowed Chile to stay 
on the road of sustained growth. 

Despite Chile's progress in the 90s in providing coverage in services 
such as health and education, improving the quality of such services 
remains an issue. In this regard, reducing the high levels of inequality 
in the Chilean economy as well as providing security to vulnerable 
groups with little social protection are still pending tasks. These are 
important challenges for Chile, which is trying to look to the future 
and make progress, searching for climate resilient low-carbon grow-
th opportunities that will allow it to increase economic growth and 
the welfare of its population increasing less its greenhouse gas emis-
sions.  

Along  these  lines,  Chile  has  made  major  efforts  to  fight  Climate 
Change. These include the incentive to Non-conventional Renewa-
ble Energies (NCRE), which, pursuant to Law 20.698, requires that, by 
2025, 20% of the energy under supply contracts subject to said law be 
generated from non-conventional renewable energies. 

The energy agenda run by the current administration considers the 
active involvement of all sectors of society, including the private sec-
tor and the civil community, and seeks to transition to a cleaner ma-
trix and raise the barriers faced by NCRE in the country. The goal is 
for 45% of all the electric generation capacity installed in the country 
between 2014 and 2025 to be generated from this type of sources. In 
2014, the installed capacities of non-conventional renewable ener-
gies doubled with respect to 2013, and the recent tenders called for 
electricity supply awarded to this type of technology proves that this 
sector will continue to expand, driven by the investments made by 
the private sector.

Chile has also pioneered the use of greenhouse gas mitigation tools, 
by including the first tax over CO2 emissions from fixed sources in 
a tax reform passed in 2014, thus contributing to counteract envi-
ronmental external factors. Specifically, the country introduces a tax 
both on global contaminant emissions (CO2) and local contaminant 
emissions (SOx, NOx, PM).

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF CHILE TOWARDS THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT OF PARIS 2015Government of Chile In the case of global contaminants, a US$5 tax is set per ton of CO2. 
In addition, a tax on new cars was imposed, based on urban perfor-
mance and NOx emissions. All this is encompassed under Law 20.780, 
which since its enactment on December 28, 2014 has resulted in a re-
duction of inefficient and contaminating cars in the last year.

The social consequences of Climate Change are crucial for establi-
shing goals to face this phenomenon, and require a joint effort by 
the Government, the private sector and civil society. Environmental 
degradation, and climate change in particular, takes its deepest toll 
on the most vulnerable sectors of the population and is, thus, a factor 
which enhances social inequality. Therefore, it is important to adopt 
perspectives which allow to counteract such effects, including the 
protection and promotion of all the human rights potentially under-
mined by this phenomenon.

According to the International Energy Agency, the average global per 
capita CO2 emissions had reached 4.5 tons per person by 2012. Chile 
was very close to this global average, and was well below the 9.7 tCO2 
per capita average of OECD countries. With respect to Latin Ameri-
ca, in 2012 Chile was responsible for 4.7% of the region's emissions, 
below Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. Globally, its contribu-
tion was about 0.25% of global emissions.

Chile's intended contribution to the UNFCCC objective is based on 
the country's current situation and is based on five basic pillars: i. 
Mitigation, ii. Adaptation, iii. Capacity Building and Strengthening, iv. 
Technology Development and Transfer, and v. Financing.

2.1 Context

Chile's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) on mi-
tigation is committed to a quantified reduction of the intensity indi-
cator of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for 2030.

This reduction is based on the sectorial analyses and the mitigation 
scenarios developed with MAPS Chile (Phase 2)4, the results of the Na-
tional Greenhouse Gas Inventory (1990-2010)5, and additional infor-
mation provided by the Ministries of Environment, Energy, Agricultu-
re and Finance, as well as the observations received during the Public 
Consultation of the Intended National Contribution6.

Chile hopes to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while decreasing 
poverty and inequality as well as continue advancing toward sustai-
nable, competitive, inclusive and low-carbon development. To con-
front these challenges successfully, the country should direct all its 
domestic efforts and international alliances to decoupling economic 
growth from greenhouse gas emissions. 

The priority sectors for mitigation in Chile are those identified in the 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (1990-2010), namely:

- 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
 
- 

Energy, which includes the generation and transport of elec 
tricity, transportation, industry, mining, housing,  among
other fossil fuel consuming sectors
Industrial processes
Use of solvents and other products
Agriculture, including the livestock sector
Use  of  the  land,  change  of  use  of  the  land  and  forestry 
(LULUCF)
Waste

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 

2.2. 
to Mitigation

Chile has chosen to report its contribution in the form of emis-
sions  intensity  (tons  of  CO2  equivalent  per  Gross  Domestic 
Product  (GDP)  in  million  CLP$2011).  In  terms  of  methodolo-
gy,  it  was  decided  to  separate  the  LULUCF  sector  from  the  na-
tional  mitigation  commitment,  due  to  the  high  annual  va-
riability  of  the  sector's  sequestrations  and  emissions,  and 
because  it  is  less  dependent  on  the  path  of  economic  growth. 

Along these lines, two types of commitments were defined:
A  carbon  intensity  target,  expressed  in  greenhouse  gas 
- 
emissions per GDP unit, which includes all the  
sectors quanti-
fied in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (1990-2010), ex-
cept for the LULUCF sector.
- 

A target expressed in CO2eq tons from the LULUCF sector.

Carbon intensity target, not including the LULUCF sector:

a) Chile is committed to reduce its CO2 emissions per GDP unit by 
30% below their 2007 levels by 2030, considering a future economic 
growth which allows to implement adequate measures to reach this 
commitment7.
b) In addition, and subject to the grant of international monetary 
funds8, the country is committed to reduce its CO2 emission per GDP 
unit by 2030 until it reaches a 35% to 45% reduction with respect to 
the 2007 levels, considering, in turn, a future economic growth which 
allows  to  implement  adequate  measures  to  achieve  this  commit-
ment.

Specific contributions to the LULUCF sector: 

a)  Chile has committed to the sustainable development and recovery 
of 100,000 hectares of forest land, mainly native, which will account 
for  greenhouse  gas  sequestrations  and  reductions  of  an  annual 
equivalent of around 600,000 of CO2 as of 2030. This commitment 
is subject to the approval of the Native Forest Recovery and Forestry 
Promotion Law.

ve species, which shall represent sequestrations of about 900,000 
and 1,200,000 annual equivalent tons of CO2 as of 2030. This com-
mitment is conditioned to the extension of Decree Law 701 and the 
approval of a new Forestry Promotion Law.

Target of the LULUCF sector:

The contribution related to the first commitment of the sector is ba-
sed on sustainable development and recovery of degraded forests,

adequate forestry measures will be taken (such as supplementary 
planting and exclusion of animals). 

In addition, measures are being considered aimed at reducing emis-
sions to reduce or prevent forest degradation, which will be applied 
in forests with non-existent or low levels of anthropic origin deterio-
ration, but with an apparent risk potential. These activities will con-
sider, for instance, preventive forestry against wildfires and compre-
hensive biomass sustainable use measures, mainly timber. Wildfires 
and the illegal harvest of timber are the main precursors of forest 
degradation in Chile, based on the last updated report by the INGEI.

In relation to the second commitment of the LULUCF sectors, this 
could  be  achieved  through  plantation  (forestation)  of  degraded 
lands in an average surface of 100,000 hectares, mainly with native 
species.

2.4.  Assessment  of  compliance  with  the  intensity 
target and the LULUCF sector

2.4.1. Greenhouse gas emissions

This will be determined using the National Greenhouse Gas Inven-
tory  submitted  by  Chile  to  the  Secretariat  of  the  United  Nations 
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  through  its  national 
communication and/or biennial update report in 2027, and with the 
progress of the report for the year 2032, discounting emissions and 
sequestrations of the LULUCF sector. Units: million CO2 equivalent 
tons.

2.4.2. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

It shall be determined based on the annual growth rate of the Gross 
Domestic Product as published in the series of National Accounts of 
the Central Bank of Chile. The Gross Domestic Product shall be carried 
to constant 2011 prices. Units: million Chilean pesos by 2011, CLP$ 2011.
2.4.3. Specific contribution to the LULUCF sector

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF CHILE TOWARDS THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT OF PARIS 2015Government of Chile16

In order to assess compliance with the commitments of the LULUCF 
sectors, the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) and the Forestry 
Institute (INFOR) are working on the corresponding Monitoring, Re-
porting and Verification (MRV) tools. 

For complying with these commitments, Chile has a series of tools. 
The main one is the Native Forest Recovery and Forest Promotion 
Law (Law 20.283), which awards credits for activities which favor the 
regeneration, recovery or protection of native forests. 

Furthermore,  the  National  Forestry  Corporation  (CONAF)  is  imple-
menting the National Climate Change and Vegetation Resource Stra-
tegy. This plan, proposes climate change mitigation and adaptation 
measures aimed at supporting the recovery and protection of native 
lands and xerophytes. In addition, it promotes the plantation of vege-
tation in apt soils belonging to small and medium-sized producers. A 
state mechanism will be designed and implemented to facilitate ac-
cess by communities and owners to the benefits associated with the 
environmental services generated by these recovered ecosystems. 
2.5. Mitigation contribution implementation and fo-
llow-up processes
 
The processes for the implementation and follow-up of Chile's con-
tributions include the following tools:
 
- 
Chile's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory System, which 
contains all the institutional, legal and procedural measures set 
forth for the biennial update of the country's national inventory.

- 
National  Climate  Change  Action  Plan  2016-2021,  which 
is  currently  being  prepared  with  a  cross-sectional  integrated 
approach to mitigation, adaptation and capacity-building, which 
aims at implementing actions and allocating mitigation respon-
sibilities.

National Energy Agenda led by the Ministry of Energy, which 
- 
includes the following targets: 30% reduction in the marginal costs 
of  electric  energy  by  2018,  20%  of  the  energetic  matrix  should  be 

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF CHILE TOWARDS THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT OF PARIS 2015Government of Chile17

made up of non-conventional renewable energies by 2025, a 20% re-
duction in the energy consumption forecast by 2025, and the design 
of a long-term energy development strategy.

- 
 National Sustainable Construction Strategy, led by the Mi-
nistry of Housing and Urban Development, which will set forth the 
guidelines to integrate the concept of sustainable development to 
the  construction  sector.  This  strategy  seeks  to  articulate  and  link 
effective energy and environmental plans by establishing goals and 
objectives in the area of energy, water, waste and health for the long, 
medium and long-term.
 
- 
tors of the economy.

Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in all sec-

- 
CO2 emission tax approved by the Tax Reform, Law 20.780 
dated October 2014, which shall become effective on January 1, 2017. 
The reform establishes an annual tax benefit lien on carbon dioxide, 
among other gases, produced by facilities whose stationary sources, 
made up of boilers or turbines, have an aggregate thermal power 
equal or higher than 50 MWt (thermal megawatts). The tax shall be 
equivalent to 5 US Dollars for every ton of CO2. 

- 
Tax on the initial sale of lightweight vehicles pursuant to Law 
20.780, which has been implemented since December 28, 2014 and 
which taxes CO2 emissions indirectly, by charging a higher tax inver-
sely proportional to vehicle performance.
2.6. Chile's work on short-lived climate pollutants

In the same way as other countries, Chile recognizes that the actions 
aimed at reducing short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) entail a subs-
tantial contribution to the mitigation of the causes of Climate Chan-
ge. In addition, these actions have known concomitant benefits, in 
terms of reducing the levels of local atmospheric pollution in urban 
centers. 

Black carbon, which is considered a SLCP, accounts for a substantial 
part of the particulate (PM2.5) measured in Chilean cities. Main sour-

ces of black carbon in Chile come from diesel transport, heating and 
residential wood fired cooking. The 2014-2018 Atmospheric Decon-
tamination Strategy of the Chilean Government contemplates the 
implementation of atmospheric decontamination plans for fine par-
ticulate matter.
 
Our country considers that the efforts made in reducing black carbon 
in the regions which have high levels of this substance will make a 
significant contribution to the sustainability of Chile's development 
and various forms of technical cooperation and international finan-
cing to support such initiatives will be welcome.

ADAPTATION

3.1. Context

Chile  is  highly  vulnerable  to  Climate  Change.  Forecasts  indicate  a 
decrease in rainfall and a temperature rise in most of the country, 
especially in the mid-northern region. As regards rainfall, an impor-
tant decrease is anticipated for the central region. An increase in the 
frequency and magnitude of extreme events, such as droughts and 
floods, is also expected. 

All these changes shall have a direct or indirect impact on our cities, 
our lifestyles, the ecosystems and the country's productive activities. 
For this reason, adaptation has been identified as one of the main 
axis of Chile's Climate Change strategy, so as to minimize the threats 
to its social and economic development. 

Our  country  currently  has  a  National  Climate  Change  Adaptation 
Plan, approved by the Sustainability Ministers' Council in December 
2014. This plan defines the guidelines for adaptation in the country 
and provides an operational structure for its coordination and im-
plementation, both with sectorial and cross-sectional approaches, in 
different administrative territorial levels.

Pursuant to this national plan, two sectorial adaptation plans have 
been developed and approved (forestry and agriculture, and biodi-
versity plans), while other seven plans are scheduled: water resour-
ces,  fisheries  and  aquaculture,  health,  energy,  infrastructure,  cities 
and tourism, sectors which jointly represent Chile's priorities in ter-
ms of adaptation. The measures of the two approved sectorial plans 
are currently undergoing a process of gradual implementation, su-
pported with national and international financing.  

For instance, the forestry and agriculture plan is made up of 21 me-
asures which mainly focus around water management, research, in-
formation and capacity-building, risk management and agricultural 
insurance and forestry management.

The  biodiversity  plan  considers  50  measures  which  focus  around 
research and development of management capacities, information 
and  environmental  awareness  at  the  national  and  local  level,  the 
promotion of sustainable farming practices and the maintenance 
of environmental services, as well as the consideration of the biodi-
versity objectives in territorial planning, and lastly, the implementa-
tion of adaptation measures for ecosystems and ground and water 
ecosystem species, coastline, continental and oceanic island water 
systems, both in rural and urban areas.

3.2. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to 
Adaptation

In the process of adaptation to Climate Change, it is key for all re-
levant  players,  particularly  the  sub-national  governments  and  the 
citizens, to become involved. For the implementation of the lines of 
action described in this document, in addition to the national funds 
allocated for this effect, Chile will also seek international financing 
mechanisms. 

Adaptation actions will be structured around two different cy cles: 
the first one to be completed in 2021, and the second one to be com-
pleted in 2030.

In order to have the necessary tools to face the impacts of 

3.2.1. 
Climate Change by 2021, Chile proposes at least the following: 
Implementing specific actions aimed at increasing resilience 
- 
in the country, under the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan 
and the sectorial plans, with a decentralized perspective and seeking 
to  integrate  efforts  among  the  different  decision-making  levels 
(national, regional, and municipal).
- 
Identifying  sources  of  financing  to  implement  said  plans, 
based on the considerations set forth in the financing section of this 
contribution.
- 
Building  synergies  with  the  contemplated  mitigation 
initiatives,  and  maximizing  the  benefits  that  stem  from  the 
development  and  capacity-building  pillars,  as  well  as  technology

3.2.2.  As of 2021, Chile has set the following aims:
-  Initiating  a  second  cy cle  of  sectorial  plans  for  Climate  Change 
adaptation, based on the experience gained so far
- Having an updated National Adaptation Plan. 
-  Developing  a  national  assessment  practice  by  2026,  through 
vulnerability  indicators  and  methodologies  aimed  at  determining 
the  increase  of  the  capacity  of  adaptation  of  the  individuals, 
communities and systems impacted by Climate Change.

CAPACITY BUILDING
AND
STRENGTHENING

4.1. Context

Chile requires a defined strategy to strengthen national and interna-
tional capacities in the face of Climate Change. Although the Minis-
try of the Environment, in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs,  has  implemented  south-south-north  collaborative  projects 
that allow for national capacity-building and strengthening in rela-
tion to Climate Change, the country currently has valuable informa-
tion and learning which it can make available to its citizens, parti-
cularly the most vulnerable sectors, but which it can also put to the 
service of its peers under the UNFCCC. 

In coordination with the Ministry of Education, Chile has begun to in-
troduce the challenges and opportunities of Climate Change in school 
curriculums. It has also created platforms for the management and 
distribution of information on Climate Change. These efforts should 
be continued, increased and spread as part of south-south coopera-
tion. The country aspires to have its citizens educated on sustainable, 
inclusive, resilient and low-carbon development.

4.2. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to 
Capacity-Building

4.2.1. The creation of forecast models that Chile can share and distri-
bute nationally and internationally, both through individual efforts 
and jointly with other countries determined to take action.
4.2.2.  Seminars, organized in conjunction with other countries wi-
lling to provide training and coaching support to nations which so 
require it, through the preparation and reporting of their planned 
national contributions, greenhouse gas emission inventories, natio-
nal communications, biennial update reports, and nationally appro-
priate mitigation actions (NAMAs).
4.2.3. The preparation of instruments to promote research and capa-
city-building at the national and sub-national level, strengthening 

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF CHILE TOWARDS THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT OF PARIS 2015Government of Chile26

the response capacity of the communities and local governments, so 
as to strengthen national adaptation capacity through institutional 
development and the capacity-building of the groups and sectors 
of the country which are most vulnerable to the impacts of Climate 
Change.

5.1. Context

Chile still requires a technology development and transfer strategy 
in order to face the national challenges related to Climate Change.

5.2. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to 
Technology Development and Transfer

In 2018 Chile will have a technology development and transfer strate-
gy which will include at least the following:
5.2.1. A baseline analysis of spending and investment in technology;
5.2.2.  Mapping  of  needs  and  technological  priorities  for  climate 
change;
5.2.3. Identification of possible implementation synergies to be used 
in the technological response to adaptation and mitigation of Clima-
te Change.

6 FINANCING

6.1. Context

Chile currently still requires a cross-sectional financing strategy to 
face national challenges posed by Climate Change. It is evident that 
part of the public national expenditure has had a positive impact 
in terms of resilience and Climate Change mitigation in the country, 
based on our 2020 commitment. Thus, in order to contribute effecti-
vely in the context of a post-2020 agreement, Chile needs to conduct 
a national evaluation of the expenditure on this matter, to make a 
contribution to the climate arena from its national circumstances 
and in line with its capacities.

6.2. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to 
Financing

In 2018, Chile will report a cross-sectional National Finance Strategy 
for Climate Change which will include at least the following:

• A periodical Climate Change public spending analysis, both direct 
and indirect, which will be updated annually after 2020;
• Creation of internal institutions which will allow to optimally ma-
nage and coordinate the relationship with the Green Climate Fund, 
which from a multi-sectorial perspective will be in charge of raising 
and assessing the fundable project portfolio, among other duties;
• Design of financial instruments which can be used for purposes 
such as adaptation and technology transfer.
Thus Chile hopes to have a baseline for financing Climate Change at 
a national level. The country would also like to be able to identify and 
structure the financial flows according to their origin, differentiating 
between national vs. international and public vs. private spending; 
and eventually according to its performance.
With a sound evaluation of its Climate Change finance, Chile will 
be in a position to implement a national financing strategy that is 
appropriate to confront the challenges and opportunities facing the 
country. This evaluation will enable it to determine an optimal finan-

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF CHILE TOWARDS THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT OF PARIS 2015Government of Chile32

cing portfolio, and eventually obtain a sustainable supply of public 
and private resources to put together an array of fundable projects 
based on the priority areas identified in this document.
