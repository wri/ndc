Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  -  Submission  of  the  Republic  of 
Kazakhstan 
The Republic of Kazakhstan is fully committed to the UNFCCC negotiation process with a 
view  to  adopting  a  global  legally  binding  agreement  applicable  to  all  parties  at  the  Paris 
Conference in December 2015, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that global temperature rise 
does not exceed 2°C. 
The  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  wishes  to  communicate  the  following  Intended  Nationally 
Determined Contributions (INDC), and intends to achieve an economy-wide target of 15%-
25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. In line with the 
Lima Call for Climate Action, the following quantifiable information is hereby submitted:

In order to emphasize its commitment to low 
carbon  growth,  Kazakhstan  has  adopted  a 
Concept on transition to a «Green» Economy. 
For  the  implementation  of  the  Concept,  an 
action is developed, under which government 
programs 
management, 
modernisation  of  housing  and  communal 
services, development of sustainable transport, 
conservation  of  ecosystems  and  enhancement 
of  forest  cover  were  adopted.  The  laws  on

greening of vehicles are being formulated.   
The implementation of the «Green» Economy 
Concept,  and  adoption  of  related  legislative 
acts,  should  lead  to  modernisation  of  key 
infrastructure  and  production 
technologies 
based  on  energy-efficient  technologies,  and 
will  make  a  significant  contribution 
to 
reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.

reduction  of  greenhouse  gas

reached 8.3%. GDP growth during this period 
has always exceeded that of the world average.
