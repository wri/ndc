INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT 

OF MALAYSIA 

 

In  accordance  with  decisions  1/CP.19  and  1/CP.20  of  the  UNFCCC,  the  Government  of 
Malaysia  is  pleased  to  communicate  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution 
(INDC), together with relevant clarifying information. 

 

MALAYSIA'S INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 

Malaysia intends to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 
2030  relative  to  the  emissions  intensity  of  GDP  in  2005.  This  consist  of  35%  on  an 
unconditional  basis  and  a  further  10%  is  condition  upon  receipt  of  climate  finance, 
technology transfer and capacity building from developed countries.

Fairness and Ambition Considerations: 

 
 

Malaysia's  total  GHG  emissions  represent  about  0.6%  of  global  emissions  in  2011.  The 
emission  intensity  per  GDP  was  0.41  tCO2eq/RM1000  for  that  year.  This  represents  a 
reduction of about 23 % from 2005 values. The total GHG emissions including removals by 
LULUCF sinks is about 0.05% of global emissions. 

The  country  continues  to  allocate  financial  resources  for  the  implementation  of  climate 
change  mitigation  programmes  through  both  public  and  private  sector  initiatives.  The 
climate-related  policies  are  implemented  along  with  national  priorities  such  as  poverty 
eradication, improving quality of life and development.  In addition, financial resources are 
also  frequently  reallocated  to  address  losses  due  to  increased  incidences  of  natural 
disasters. 

  Malaysia has taken early action   

Since the Ninth Malaysia Plan (2006-2010), Malaysia has started initiatives to increase the 
share  of  use  of  non-fossil  fuel  energy.  The  National  Biofuel  Policy  2006  already  laid  the 
groundwork  for  the  development  and  use  of  biofuels.  The  National  Biofuel  Industry  Act 
2007 was put in place to regulate the biofuel industry and to promote the mandatory use of 
the B5 domestic blend of 5% palm biodiesel and 95% fossil fuel diesel.  At the end of 2014, 
Malaysia had also introduced the bio-diesel B7 Programme.  

The  Tenth  Malaysia  Plan  (2011-2015)  focussed  on  sustainable  growth  and  introducing 
mitigation  strategies  to  reduce  emissions  of  GHG.  Three  significant  financial  tools  were 
introduced to promote sustainability measures. These consist of the introduction of a feed-
in-tariff (FiT) mechanism in conjunction with  the Renewable Energy Policy and Action Plan 
(2010) to help finance renewable energy investment, providing fiscal incentives and funding 
for green technology investments and promoting projects eligible for carbon credits. In the 
forestry  sector,  two  major  initiatives  were  launched,  the  Central  Forest  Spine  (CFS)  and 
Heart  of  Borneo  (HOB)  to  ensure  sustainable  forest  management  and  use  of  natural 
resources.  

The government will continue to pursue the green growth goal under the Eleventh Malaysia 
Plan  (2016-2020)  will  further  focus on  pursuing  green  growth  for  sustainability  and 
resilience. These include strengthening enabling environment for green growth, adoption of 
sustainable  consumption  and  production,  conserving  natural  resources  and  strengthening 
resilience  against  climate  change  and  natural  disasters.    These  actions  will  further  reduce 
Malaysia's carbon footprint.  

  Major barriers for implementation include high costs and capacity constraints 

Malaysia  developed  A  Roadmap  of  Emissions  Intensity  Reduction  in  Malaysia  in  2014.  The 
study  indicated  that  Malaysia  has  opportunities  across  various  sectors  to  meet  the 
reduction  target  of  40%  emissions  intensity  reduction  of  GDP.    However,  while  these 
opportunities  exist,  considerable  efforts  would  be  required  to  realise  these  emissions 
reductions in light of the challenges and barriers described below.  
 

 
 

TECHNOLOGY COST 

 
 

 
 

Many mitigation actions are limited by the cost and suitability of appropriate technologies.  
Generation  cost  of  renewable  energy  is  still  higher  than  conventional  energies  while  rail 
based  mass  transport  systems  have  high  capital  cost.    Benefit  relating  to  electrification  of 
transportation  systems  are  also  limited  by  the  current  fuel  mix  used  for  electricity 
generation which consist mainly of fossil fuels.  

INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK and CAPACITY 

Climate change is a cross cutting issue and currently the institutional framework to address 
the  issue  is  fragmented.  It  is  often  a  consequential  co-benefit  outcome  of  agencies'  core 
responsibilities.  Creating  long-term  commitment  from  all  stakeholders,  businesses,  civil 
society,  and  people,  is  critical  as  this  transition  and  associated  results  will  take  time.  In 
addition, new competencies and skills need to be developed. 

LULUCF LEGACY ISSUES 

Malaysia  has  a  long  forest  management  history.  However,  there  are  some  areas  of  forest 
that have been degraded due to past management effects. Restoration and rehabilitation of 
these forests incurs high cost and nurturing. Furthermore, the advent of climate change has 
also highlighted another legacy in forest management, that is, the drained peatlands. In the 
1960s  and  70s,  peatlands  were  considered  a  wasteland  and  draining  was  considered  an 
effective  rehabilitation  to  improve  the  productivity.  Some  of  these  drained  peatlands  are 
now unmanaged and are susceptible to wildfires during the dry seasons. It is also expensive 
to "re-wet" these areas.  

Adaptation 

Over the past five decades, positive trends in temperature increase have been observed in 
Malaysia.  The  surface  mean  temperature  increase  is  around  0.14°C  to  0.25°C  per  decade. 
The surface maximum temperature increase is around 0.17°C to 0.22°C per decade, and the 
surface  minimum  temperature  increase  is  around  0.20°C  to  0.32°C  per  decade.  Realising 
adaptation to climate change is required to build resilience, Malaysia has taken early actions 
to mainstream adaptation to climate change into development. During the Tenth Malaysia 
Plan, Malaysia spent RM51 billion to enhance resilience against climate change. A national 
adaptation plan would be developed to provide greater coordinated implementation. 

Addressing Flood Risks 

Malaysia is prone to seasonal monsoon floods. Average annual direct loss from these floods 
amounts to RM915 million. In the recent decade, rainfall intensity has increased leading to 
more severe monsoonal floods. Urban areas are also becoming more prone to flash floods 
due  to  the  higher  rainfall  intensity.  In  the  extreme  floods  in  2014,  damage  to  public 
infrastructure  amounted  to  RM2.9  billion.  However,  Malaysia  has  been  implicitly  building 
adaptation  resilience  through  its  development  Plans.  From  2004  to  2014,  Malaysia  has 
invested  over  RM  9.3  billion  on  flood  mitigation.  Flood  mitigation  programmes  and 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

strengthening of disaster risk management and resilience of infrastructure would be further 
enhanced in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and beyond. 

Water Security 

Over 97% of the water supply is derived from surface water in rivers and reservoirs, hence 
management of these vital water catchment areas is crucial to ensure a reliable source of 
water  supply.  As  part  of  forward  planning  on  water  supply  requirements,  a  Review of  the 
National Water Resources Study (2000-2050) was completed in 2011 and a National Water 
Resources  Policy  was  formulated  in  2012.  To  ensure  adequate  and  safe  water  supplies, 
inter-basin water transfer projects are being implemented to supply water to areas that are 
experiencing  water-stress  due  to  high  economic  and  population  growth  and  spatial  and 
temporal shifts in rainfall distribution. Although expensive, these infrastructure investments 
are  necessary  to  address  water  resource  needs under  a  future  climate  regime.  During  the 
Tenth  Malaysia  Plan,  over  RM  12  billion  were  spent  on  improving  the  water  sector 
infrastructure, with over RM 5.6 billion being used for developing the water supply for the 
rural areas. Moving forward, the Eleventh Malaysia Plan  among others aims to strengthen 
the regulatory framework of the water services industry, expand the water supply network 
and treatment capacity infrastructure and increase the efficiency of water supply services. 
  
Food Security 

The development of the agriculture sector in Malaysia is guided by the National Agro-food 
Policy (2011-2020) and the National Commodity Policy (2011-2020), which aim to increase 
food production and exports of industrial commodities. In the Tenth Malaysia Plan, RM 5.1 
billion was allocated to improve the agriculture and agro-based industries in Malaysia. The 
Eleventh Malaysia Plan would further expand implementation of good agricultural practices 
and  intensifying  research  and  development  for  improving  agriculture  production.  New 
granary  areas  and  adequate  and  efficient  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  will  be 
developed to increase the production of rice.  

Protecting Coastlines 

Malaysia has about 5267km of coastline and 29% of these faces erosion problems.  As part 
of  the  solution  towards  coastal  erosion,  both  hard  and  soft  engineering  approaches  had 
been  implemented.  For  the  longer  term,  Integrate  Shoreline  Management  Plans  (ISMPs) 
have  been  developed  and  implemented  for  specific  areas.  In  addition,  a  National  Coastal 
Vulnerability  Index  to  sea-level  rise  is  being  developed.  Detailed  sea  level  rise  studies  had 
also been conducted at some of the vulnerable coastal areas to project future vulnerabilities 
in a 20-year sequence from 2020 to 2100. 

Health 

During the Tenth Malaysia Plan, Malaysia spent over RM 9 billion on the health sector, with 
over RM 1.5 billion being for adaptation of the health sector to climate change. In particular, 
vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria are expected to be  further exacerbated 
by rising  temperatures  and  high  rainfall.  The  dengue  menace  in urban  centres  has  been  a 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

constant  public  health  challenge  affecting  a  wide  population  of  all  age groups  in  Malaysia 
and  this  is  expected  to  worsen  with  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  The  control  and 
prevention  of  dengue  transmission  using  early  test  kits  and  community  behavioural 
intervention as well as exploratory research on alternative medicines are among the efforts 
being undertaken.  

In  addition,  climate-related  disasters  are  already  posing  huge  challenges  to  the  public 
disaster management systems. Ensuring clean water supply and optimal sewerage services 
are particularly difficult during disasters such as flooding, as experienced during the recent 
year-end massive flooding that affected several states, giving rise to food and water-borne 
diseases.
