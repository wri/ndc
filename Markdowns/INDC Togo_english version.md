INTRODUCTION 
 
Togo has historically emitted little in the way of greenhouse gases and so has only had a very small 
part  to  play  in  the  current  climate  crisis.  However,  it  must  already  contend  with  the  harmful 
consequences  of  climate  change.  Although  it  is  one  of  the  least  developed  countries  and  has  high 
needs  in  terms  of  development  and  adaptation,  Togo  nonetheless  wants  to  contribute  to 
international  efforts  to  limit  the  temperature  rise  to  2°C  by  implementing  mitigation  measures. 
Togo's  commitment  is  fair,  equitable  and  ambitious,  while  still  taking  the  nation's  reality  into 
account.  Over  and  above  its  national  commitments,  responding  to  current  and  future  adaptation 
needs  and  embarking  on  a  carbon-lean  development  path  will  require  transparent,  long  term 
international cooperation and financial support. 
 
Togo  is  aware  of  the  need  to  increase  its  means  of  action  and  so  is  committed  to  promoting  a 
regional  development  vision  for  the  concerned  populations,  in  a  spirit  of  solidarity,  while  also 
participating in the international fight against climate change.  
 
The  INDC  was  prepared  under  the  aegis  of  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment  and  Forest  Resources 
(MERF),  in  a  participatory,  inclusive  process  that  included  the  effective  involvement  of  every 
stakeholder.

1. 

NATIONAL CONTEXT 

Physical context 

Socioeconomic context  

 
1.1 
A West African country, Togo is located between 6° and 11° North latitude and between 0° and 1°40 
East longitude, with a total area of 56,600 km². Average rainfall varies between 800 and 1,400 mm, 
with an average temperature of 27°C to 28°C. The country has 50 km of maritime coastline subject to 
erosion. Its arable land is estimated at close to 3.4 million hectares (64% of the country), just 55% of 
which  were  cultivated  in  2010.  Total  irrigable  land  covers  approximately  86,000  hectares,  and  the 
country's  exploitable  shallows  span  175,000  hectares.  Surface  and  groundwater  are  estimated  at 
between  17  and  21  billion  cubic  metres  of  water  each  year,  for  annual  consumption  of  some  3.4 
billion m3. Plant formations have been significantly degraded and the rate of deforestation stands at 
around  15,000  ha/year,  compared  with  a  pace  of  reforestation  that  barely  exceeds  3,000  ha 
annually.  
 
1.2 
Togo's  2010  population  was  6,191,155  (4th  Census,  2010),  with  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of 
2.84%. On that basis, the country can expect to reach 7,121,673 inhabitants in 2015, 60% of whom 
under  the  age of 25.  As  a result,  Togo  will  need  to meet  the  challenge of  providing  decent  jobs to 
that  population,  once  it  hits  the  labour  market.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  rose  from  FCFA 
1,581.3  billion  in  2010  (baseline  year)  to  FCFA  2,076.6  billion  in  2015,  or  a  per  capita  GDP of  FCFA 
255,419 and FCFA 291,583 respectively. Despite the progress made (0.459 in 2012 (2013 HDI Report), 
or  a  0.007  improvement  over  2010),  Togo's  Human  Development  Index  (HDI)  remains  low  (ranked 
159th  out  of  the  187  countries  evaluated).  Poverty  is  still  very  high  in  Togo,  affecting  58.7%  of  the 
population  in  2011  (SCAPE,  August  2013),  compared  with  61.7%  in  2006.  The  household  lighting 
penetration rate stands at 23%, according to the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP, July 
2015).  The  2011  QUIBB  well-being  indicator  questionnaire  showed  that  the  main  social  indicators 
had generally improved, although their levels are still worrying: net primary schooling rate (87.8%), 
adult  literacy  rate  (60.3%,  with  a  clear  disparity  between  the  sexes:  74.0%  for  men  and  47.9%  for 
women), morbidity rate (20.6%), rate of access to drinking water (56.1%), proportion of households 
with  sanitation  (53.1%),  rate  of  malnutrition  (27.9%),  rate  of  households  having  difficulty  meeting 
their dietary needs (49.5%), rate of use of health services (66.2%) and unemployment rate (24.3%). 
 
1.3 
The national strategic orientations underlying sectoral programmes and policies can be found in the 
document Togo Vision 2030, currently under production, and in the Strategy for Accelerated Growth 
and Employment Promotion (SCAPE) 2013-2017. Togo's SCAPE defines a development framework for 
the  medium  term  in  order  to  fulfil  its  General  Policy  Declaration  (DPG)  based  on  the  Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) covering the 2006-2015 period and to transform Togo into an emerging 
country  within the  next  15  to  20 years.  The sectoral policies  and  strategies  in  effect  for vulnerable 
economic sectors and those emitting GHGs are recorded in Annex II, Table 1. 
 
1.4 
For several years now, Togo has been engaged in a proactive strategy for sustainable development 
and  against  global  warming.  Its  efforts  focus  mainly  on:  bad  production  practices  in  the  economic 
sectors; lack of population control; and the high poverty rate, which is exacerbated by the negative 
impacts  of  climate  change,  further  reinforcing  the  vulnerability  of  the  production  sectors  and  the 
pressure  on  natural  resources.  This  political  will  can  be  seen,  amongst  others,  in  the  National 
Environmental  Action  Plan  (NEAP),  the  National  Environmental  Management  Programme  (NEMP), 
the  National  Sustainable  Development  Strategy  (December  2011),  the  National  Environmental 
Management  Capacity-building  Strategy  (October  2008),  the  National  Programme  for  Reducing 

National and sectoral strategic development orientations

Climate  &  Clean  Air  Coalition  (CCAC) means  it  could  raise  funds  to  finance  its  short  term  GHG  and 
climate pollutant mitigation actions.  
 
1.5 
The fight against climate change and the implementation of sustainable development are part of the 
following  key  institutional  initiatives:  (i)  existence  of  a  ministry  specifically  dedicated  to  managing 
environmental  and  natural  resources  policies  since  1987;  (ii)  creation  of  an  Environmental 
Directorate at the Ministry of the Environment and Forest Resources (MERF), one of whose duties is 
to  coordinate  the  mechanisms  defined  in  the  conventions  that  Togo  has  signed;  (iii)  creation  of  a 
National Climate Change Committee; and (iv) establishment of an institutional framework to prepare 
for the Third National Communication (TCN). In terms of international environmental commitments, 
Togo  is  a  Party  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  the 
Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  and  the  United  Nations  Convention  to  Combat 
Desertification  (UNCCD).  The  main  national  laws  adopted  in  relation  to  climate  change  are:  Law 
2008-005  of  30  May  2008  enacting  the  framework  law  on  the  environment  replacing  the 
Environmental Code; Law 2008-009 of 19 June 2008 enacting the Forest Code; Decree 2006-058/PR 
of  5  July  2006  defining  a  list  of  works,  activities  and  planning  documents  subject  to  environment 
impact assessments (EIAs) and its implementing orders; Law 99-003 of 18 February 1999 enacting the 
Hydrocarbons Code of the Republic of Togo. 
 

2. 

ADAPTATION 

 
National reality and vision 

2.1 
Adaptation  and  development  are  Togo's  priorities,  bearing  in  mind  that  its  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) 
emissions  in  2010  (baseline  year)  represented  just  0.05%  of  total  emissions  worldwide.  In 
consideration  of  the  vulnerability  of  its  economic  sectors  and  of  the  social  and  environmental 
consequences  of  the  effects  of  climate  change,  Togo  has  defined  its  national  priority  as  the 
development and implementation of an adaptation strategy and options that would have an impact 
on the mitigation scenarios, in terms of co-benefits. 
 
Togo intends to contribute to the fight against climate change by strengthening the resilience of its 
production  systems  and  means  by  embarking  on  a  carbon-lean  development  path.  This  vision  is  in 
line with international commitments and national strategic orientations relating to the need for fair, 
inclusive  growth  that  responds  to  the  challenges  of  sustainability,  creates  decent  jobs,  helps  to 
reduce  poverty,  and  protects  natural  resources.  These  key  points  are  also  included  in  the  National 
Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) for climate change, produced in December 2008 and whose 
objectives relate to: (i) the protection of human lives and livelihoods, resources, infrastructure and 
the  environment;  (ii)  the  identification  of  grassroots  communities'  urgent,  immediate  needs  for 
adaptation  to  the  harmful  impacts  of  climate  change  and  variability;  and  (iii)  the  incorporation  of 
adaptation measures and objectives into sectoral policies and national planning. 
 
2.2 
Climate  observations1  during  the  period  running  from  1961  to  2012  reveal  an  unmistakable  rise  in 
temperatures, as well as a decrease in rainfall and in the number of days of rain. The linear trend in 
                                                 
1Observations  of  the  climate  system  in  Togo  are  based  on  direct  measurements  of  climate  parameters 
performed by national meteorology services. 

Impacts of climate change  

__________________________________________________________________________________________I
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Togo 
the national average for temperature data between 1961 and 2012 indicates warming by 1°C. On the 
other  hand,  according  to  the  baseline  scenarios  assessed  for  the  Third  National  Communication 
(TCN),  the  simulations  run  using  SimCLIM  2013  for  the  pessimistic  scenario  of  RCP8.5  reveal  an 
overall average annual temperature increase in Togo fluctuating between 0.60°C and 0.71°C higher 
than current levels in 2025, and between 3.6°C and 4.5°C higher in 2100, depending on the latitude 
being  considered.  For  those  same  periods,  annual  precipitation  would  increase  throughout  the 
country  by  4  to  8  mm  over  its  current  level  in  2025  and  by  18  to  39  mm  of  rain  by  2100.  The 
associated impacts on the main sectors considered to be sensitive are: 
 

(i)  Energy: a spatial analysis reveals that the savannah region, which is already facing the highest 
poverty rate and increasingly scarce wood resources, would have the lowest capacity to 
respond,  with  consequences  that  would  aggravate  nutritional  and  food  insecurity  and 
increase both monetary and non-monetary poverty. At the same time, the supply of fuel 
wood from Lomé and the maritime region would become virtually impossible; 

 

(ii)  Water  resources:  in  consideration  of  current  and  forecast  demographic  growth  rates,  the 
water  supply  would  be  severely  affected,  with  a  drop  in  stocks  due  to  global  warming 
and heavy pollution of drinking water reserves as a result of flooding, salt water intrusion 
into coastal aquifers and water encroachment; 

 

(iii) Agriculture, forestry and land use: a decline in the supply of vegetables, meats and fish and in 
provisions sent to the cities could lead to social tensions, or even socio-political crises, a 
loss  of  income  for  producers,  land  degradation,  loss  of  biodiversity,  pest  invasions  of 
crops, livestock and fishing yields, wood shortages, and the disappearance of wetlands; 
 

(iv) Human settlements (buildings and cities) and health: an increase in State, local government 
and household spending to build new housing and socioeconomic infrastructure and to 
rehouse  disaster  victims,  massive  rural  exodus,  the  spread  of  illnesses  like  malaria, 
diarrhoea,  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  disease,  and  others,  will  entail  additional 
expenses, lead to famine and aggravate food insecurity; 
 

(v)  Coastal zones: erosion causing the loss of goods and physical resources and threatening the 

entire coastal zone, where more than 90% of the country's industrial units are located. 

Togo's needs in terms of adaptation, with co-benefits on mitigation 

 
2.3 
Togo is faced with major challenges in respect of adaptation, taking account of today's climate reality 
and  the  expected  effects  in  a  more  or  less  faraway  future,  as  the  consequences  of  the  announced 
foreseeable changes. Its needs are identified below, in the form of measures: (i) reinforcing actions in 
favour  of  energy  efficiency  and  carbon-lean  technologies;  (ii)  promoting  integrated,  sustainable 
water resources management; (iii) strengthening the resilience of production systems and means in 
the  agricultural  sector;  (iv)  building  the  capacities  of  human  settlements  (buildings  and  cities)  to 
adapt to climate change; and (v) protecting the coastal zone. 
 
The approach selected by Togo involves the implementation of a portfolio of measures and projects 
in  response  to  adaptation  issues  and  national  development  priorities,  bearing  in  mind  that 
adaptation options that also mitigate GHG emissions will be prioritized wherever possible. 
 
These  needs  are  a  response  to  national  concerns  expressed  by  all  the  actors.  They  have  been 
quantified  and  approved  through  a  consultation  process  and,  over  and  above  the  national  process 
instituted  as  part  of  the  launch  and  steering  of  the  INDC,  the  different  actors  involved  also  met  in 
thematic groups on the most vulnerable sectors. This entailed a prioritization of the sectors and sub-
sectors  and  the  identification  of  the  main  priority  measures,  as  well  as  the  conditions  of  their 

__________________________________________________________________________________________I
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Togo 
implementation.  For  each  sector,  the  approach  was  to  consider  the  degree  of  impact  on  national 
development  priorities  such  as  employment,  poverty  reduction,  increased  beneficiary  revenue  and 
GDP,  and  the  positive  impact  on  clean,  carbon-lean  growth  and  development,  while  taking  the 
climate realities of today and tomorrow into consideration. Each sectoral measure was then broken 
down into a series of operational activities supplemented by an economic analysis to assess the need 
for financial support. 
 
An  analysis  of  the  collected  data  made  it  possible  to  identify  the  priorities,  measures  and  funding 
needs  (Annex  IV,  Table  2).    The  priority  sectors  are,  by  order  of  importance:  1st:  Energy;  2nd: 
Agriculture;  3rd:  Human  settlements  and  health;  4th:  Water  resources;  5th:  Coastal  erosion;  and  6th: 
Land use, land-use change and forestry. 
 
The total funding required is estimated at approximately US$1.54 billion between 2020 and 2030.

GHG EMISSIONS MITIGATION IN TOGO 

 

3.1. Contributions  

Togo  plans  to  adopt  an  approach  based  on  contributions  founded  on  both  measures  to  be 
introduced and targeted results in order to better identify any opportunities for co-benefits in terms 
of reducing GHG emissions that might potentially be derived from synergies between adaptation and 
mitigation. 

 

Togo's contributions to global mitigation work can be characterized as follows: 

 

o  Commitments:  Togo  confirms  its  commitment  to  contributing  to  the  achievement  of  the 
UNFCCC's  objectives  to  limit  temperature  rises  to  2°C  by  2030.  Togo  has  already 
implemented  activities  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  especially  in  the  energy, 
agriculture and LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) sectors. Subject to being in 
possession  of  the  necessary  resources,  Togo  has  confirmed  that  it  is  aiming  for  a  more 
ambitious reduction target. 

 
o  Main  data  sources:  national  climate  strategies,  policies  and  actions  plans;  prior  UNFCCC 
submissions;  declarations  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Summit;  Nationally  Appropriate 
Mitigation Actions (NAMA); national communications; and a new analysis performed for the 
purpose of producing the INDC. 
 

o  Cover: Entire economy. 

Main sectors: Energy, agriculture and LULUCF. 
Gases: CO2, CH4 and N2O. 
 

o  Scenario  trajectories:  Togo  aims  to  reduce  its  emissions  as  shown  in  the  graph  in  Figure  1 

below, which provides information on both unconditional and conditional options.

o  The baseline scenario is the scenario with "no measures applied".  

 

o  Under  the  business-as-usual  (BAU)  scenario  (accounting  for  the  implementation  of  already 
programmed measures), the overall reduction rate in 2030 would be 11.14% compared with 
Togo's total 2030 emissions based on the baseline year (2010). This reduction in emissions is 
attributed to the implementation of sectoral work. 
 

o  Targets:  The  conditional  target  for  additional  GHG  emissions  reduction,  according  to  the 
most ambitious scenario, is estimated at 20% compared to the dynamic BAU. The conditional 
target  for  the  total  reduction  would  therefore  be  31.14%  in  2030,  compared  to  the 
projections if no measures were to be applied. 
 

o  Stakeholder support and engagement: The process for determining the contributions was a 
participatory  one,  with  a  number  of  consultations  with  the  stakeholders  in  order  to 
understand the realities and the concerns of key sectors like energy, agriculture and LULUCF. 

GHG mitigation measures and options 

 
3.2 
Togo's GHG mitigation measures in its three priority sectors (energy, agriculture, and land use, land-
use change and forestry) and the associated costs (totalling US$1.1 billion) are described below. 
 

(i)  In the energy sector, they pertain to the promotion of household use of biomass, plus solar 
electricity and road transport. As concerns biomass, this will entail the implementation of 
a  proactive  policy  (with  incentives,  support  and  training  for  craftsmen,  appropriate 
distribution  channels,  etc.)  that  can  promote  the  roll-out  of  energy-efficient  stoves, 
which  can  yield  50-60%  savings  in  wood  and  charcoal.  Emphasis  will  also  be  placed  on 
the  introduction  of  solar  equipment  in  households  and  on  capacity-building  for  the 
various actors concerned. In terms of road transport, the planned actions aim to reduce 

__________________________________________________________________________________________I
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Togo 
the  consumption  of  fossil  fuels  in  Togo  by  20%  over  the  course  of  the  period  under 
review,  by  improving  the  road  system,  promoting  the  use  of  public  transport, reducing 
the  average  age  of  imported  vehicles  (to  5-7  years)  and  promoting  active  modes  of 
transport (bicycles, walking, bike paths). Cost: US$460 million. 

(ii)  For  the  agricultural  sector, mitigation options have been identified in the fields of livestock 
farming, rice growing, farmland and the burning of the savannahs. Concerning livestock, 
the actions will involve the introduction of fodder to improve animal digestion, support 
in  the  promotion  of  local  breeds,  and  extensive  livestock  farming.  In  terms  of  the  rice 
industry, the actions will target the identification and promotion of varieties of rain-fed 
rice,  and  support  and  guidance  in  the  better  use  of  organic  matter  (for  faster 
decomposition)  in  the  paddy  fields.  For  farmland,  a  study  will  be  conducted  to 
characterize it into agro-ecological zones, as well as a research and support programme 
on  organic  and  synthetic  enriching  agents  that  release  less  GHG,  the  study  and 
promotion  of  optimal  waste  management  for  livestock  and  harvest  remnants,  and  the 
promotion  of  land  use  planning  practices  that  boost  carbon's  binding  to  farmland  and 
agroforestry.  In  respect  of  the  burning  of  the  savannahs,  the  planned  actions  target  a 
participatory fight against bush fires. Cost: US$140 million. 
 

(iii) In  the  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  sector,  the  priority  actions  relate  to:  (i)  the 
promotion  of  private,  community  and  State  reforestation  through  the  creation  of 
plantations and the promotion of agroforestry on cultivated land; (ii) sustainable forest 
planning  and  protection  (by  managing  brush  fires,  regenerating  degraded  sites,  and 
demarcating and developing protected areas and tourist sites); and (iii) the cartographic 
study  of  geographic  areas  with  a  strong  potential  for  the  development  of  biofuels  in 
conjunction with food security issues.  Cost: US$500 million.

contribution. 

Togo is a Non-Annex 1 Party to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) and is also a least developed 
country (LDP). In accordance with the declaration 
of the African Ministers in Marrakesh in April 
2015, the country wants to encourage 
investments in mitigation projects on its own soil, 
thanks in particular to the Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM) and the REDD+ Programme.

3.4 Equity and Ambition 

 

Equity and Ambition 

Equity  
 
Togo is a small country that emits almost no GHGs and so has virtually no responsibility in terms of 
global  warming.  Through  its  INDC,  Togo  proposes  to  focus  its  efforts  on  carbon-lean  sustainable 
development, by encouraging sustainable practices, whereas the easy solution would simply be to 
continue using fossil fuels while they are still available. 
 
According to the IPCC, the estimated worldwide GHG emissions for 2010 totalled roughly 40,000 
Mt  of  CO2e.  The  emissions  from  the  Republic  of  Togo  for  that  same  year  were  estimated  at 
approximately  20.45 Mt of  CO2e,  representing  about 0.05% of  the  total volume.  In  other words, 
those  emissions  are  non-significant  compared  with  worldwide  emissions.  Nonetheless,  with  this 
contribution,  Togo  is  reaffirming  its  adherence  to  the  principle  of  common  but  differentiated 
responsibilities and has committed to implementing ambitious measures to contribute to the goal 
of +2°C. 
 
This contribution guarantees an equitable commitment. 
 
Ambition 
Thanks to measures already in progress, Togo will unconditionally reduce its emissions by 11.14% 
compared to the baseline scenario in 2030. 
Togo undertakes to back its adaptation capacity-building strategy and its development imperatives 
against a carbon-lean growth trajectory that will translate into a conditional reduction of its GHG 
emissions  by  20%.  This  ambitious  contribution  will  support  the  commitments  made  by  the 
international community. 
 
Togo's contribution is also ambitious, because it will lead to long term transformations in the key 
sectors of  energy,  agriculture,  and  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  that  will  decrease  the 
future vulnerability of the concerned populations and territories.

PLANNING PROCESS 

The  Ministry  of  the  Environment  and  Forest  Resources  (MERF)  intends  to  organize  regular 
consultations to re-examine the implementation of the adaptation and mitigation measures set out 
in the INDC. This will be a recurring process, to ensure that the INDC is indeed being implemented 
and  is  updated  regularly.  The  process  put  in  place  for  this  purpose  will  make  use  of  existing 
frameworks: 
 
The Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion (SCAPE) 2013-2017 takes account 
of climate change, namely via the actions listed in its paragraph 2.3.5.3, "Environment, sustainable 
natural resources management and living conditions", for area 5. These relate to the:  
 

(a)  Maintenance  of  the  ecosystems'  environmental  services  and  the  preservation  of 

biodiversity; 
 

__________________________________________________________________________________________I
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Togo 
(b)  Sustainable management of land, catastrophes and natural resources;  
 
(c)  Fight  against  climate  change,  which  the  Government  recognizes  as  a  major 

preoccupation, particularly:  

(i)   the  reinforcement  of  the  institutional  framework  for  implementation  of  the 
United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  and  the  adaptation 
and mitigation measures for the main development sectors,  

(ii)   the strengthening of the national multi-sector, multi-actor dialogue,  
(iii)  the  updating  and  implementation  of  the  National  Adaptation  Programme  of 

Action for climate change, and  

(iv)  the  definition  and  implementation  of  a  low  carbon  emissions  development 

strategy to engage the country in long term mitigation actions;  

 
(d)  Sustainable management of the coastal zone; and 
 
(e)  Sustainable management of living conditions, including housing and waste.  

 
It should also be noted that climate change has been targeted as one of the five risks identified for 
the  implementation  of  SCAPE.  However,  provisions  have  also  been  introduced  to  account  for 
mitigation actions on the said risks. The INDC provides a response to that concern. 
 
All  the  national  programmes,  strategies  and  plans  have  prepared  planning,  monitoring  and 
evaluation mechanisms. These different documents include the National Environmental Action Plan 
(NEAP)  process,  the  National  Environmental  Policy,  the  final  NEAP  document,  the  National 
Environmental  Management  Programme,  the  National  Sustainable  Development  Strategy  (NSDS), 
the  National  Strategy  for  Reducing  the  Risk  of  Catastrophes  in  Togo,  the  National  Programme  for 
Reducing  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation  (REDD+)  (2010-
2050), the National Medium Term Priority Framework (NMTPF) for Togo (2010-2015), and Adapting 
Agriculture in Togo to Climate Change (ADAPT). 
 
Togo  has  a  number  of  national  committees:  the  National  Climate  Change  Committee,  the  National 
NAPA Committee, the National NAMA Committee and the Designated National CDM Authority. All of 
these have monitoring and evaluation bodies that the INDC will be able to utilize. 

 

in  the  context  of  the 

Further, 
its  process  of  developing  national 
communications,  Togo  will  be  relying  on  certain  institutions  that  have  quality  assurance  (QA)  and 
quality  control  (QC)  systems,  and  with  which  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment  has  established  a 
partnership.  This  involves  the  following  structures  responsible  for  GHG  inventories  and  mitigation 
measures in the concerned sectors: 

institutionalization  of 

 
•  National Graduate School of Engineering (ENSI) for the energy sector; 
•  Graduate School of Agricultural Engineering (ESA) for the agricultural sector; 
• 

Laboratory of Botany and Plant Ecology (LBEV) for the agriculture, forestry and other land use 
sector; 
Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry (LCA), which is responsible for compiling the GHG 
inventories and producing the TCN document; and 
Laboratory for the Management, Treatment and Recovery of Waste (GTVD). 

• 

• 

 
All this will be supplemented by the development of a monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) 
system  that  will  include  the  adaptation  and  mitigation  indicators  defined  in  existing  legislation, 
policies, strategies, programmes and plans, in order to better monitor the INDC's implementation.

IMPLEMENTATION METHODS 

This section describes the necessary support in the form of financing, capacity-building, technology 
transfers  and  others,  linked  to  the  implementation  of  the  INDC.  The  provided  information  covers 
adaptation  and mitigation and  could  help  international  partners  to  better  understand  the  needs  in 
order to target their support for Togo. 
 
All  of  this  information  is  contained  in  the  technology  needs  assessment  documents,  the  national 
climate  strategies  and  actions  plans,  the  communication  strategy  for  climate  change  and  the 
transition  to  the  green  economy,  capacity-building  needs  assessments, 
investment  needs 
assessments,  national  communications,  NAMAs,  the  NAPA,  and  the  PNIERN  (National  Investment 
Programme for the Environment and Natural Resources), in addition to being summarized in the first 
part of this document. 
 

a)  Capacity-building 

Satisfaction of the identified needs will be decisive in reinforcing the effectiveness of implementation 
of the INDC. Real efforts have been made to build both personal and institutional capacities during 
the First, Second and Third National Communications. However, many needs will still have to be met 
before achieving the national skills and expertise that will be necessary in order to carry out climate 
change initiatives successively and for the long term. 
 
In  order  to  meet  its  development  and  adaptation  challenges  and  to  implement  its  roadmap,  Togo 
must first build up its capacities. This will need to remedy the following, in particular:  

• 
Insufficient reliable climate data for a realistic analysis and interpretation of climate change; 
•  Weak technical, institutional and legal capacities required to support the development of the 

horizontal integration of adaptation at the national, sub-national and local levels; and  
•  Shortage of financial resources to support the implementation of the adaptation and 

mitigation initiatives. 

Cost: US $0.4 billion. 
 
The institutionalization process that is now under way will make it possible to train a larger number 
of experts and to reinforce and provide tools to research and excellence centres on climate change. 
Further, the national INDC committee will become a standing committee, endowed with appropriate 
means so that it can fulfil its role effectively. A long term coordination team will also be created to 
monitor and evaluate the INDC activities. 

 

b)  Technology transfers 

The technology transfer needs were identified and can essentially be summarized as follows: 
 

•  Produce  and  popularise  energy-efficient  stoves  using  wood,  charcoal  and  gas  among  all  of 
the country's social strata (a process that will need to begin with subsidies or appropriate tax 
benefits); 

•  Promote  renewable  energies  (thermal  solar,  photovoltaic,  micro-hydraulic,  wind,  etc.)  by 
facilitating  access  to  those  technologies  and  training  the  populations  on  how  to  use  and 
manage them; and 

•  Promote internal expertise and good practices for safeguarding the forest cover and fighting 

bush fires. 

Cost: US $0.5 billion. 

__________________________________________________________________________________________I
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Togo 
 

c)  Financial support 

To implement its INDC, Togo will need three point five four(3.54) billion US dollars, one point five 
four (1.54) billion of which for adaptation, one point ten (1.10) billion of which for mitigation, zero 
point five (0.5) billion for technology transfers and zero point four (0.4) billion for capacity-building. 
 
These  estimates  represent  additional  financing  needs  over  and  above  the  cost  of  any  national 
decisions that would have been implemented in any case, in view of the defined national priorities.

REGIONAL POLITICAL VISION 

 
Togo  hosts  a  number  of  regional  and  sub-regional  institutions  like  BOAD,  EBID  and  SABER,  which 
have set up mitigation initiatives. Additionally, BOAD also houses the Regional Collaboration Centre 
(RCC) for the UNFCCC's sustainable development mechanisms. The BOAD and the RCC have initiated 
a  support  process  for  INDCs,  as  channels  that  provide  access  to  funding,  technology  and  capacity-
building,  but  also  to  perform  monitoring,  reporting  and  verification  (MRV)  on  the  results  of 
mitigation actions. 
 
Togo, being aware of its geographic location, the regional and international institutions that it hosts, 
as well as the sub-region's economic issues, intends to play a unique regional role, uniting, mobilizing 
and sharing a common vision and common action resources with its neighbouring countries. It also 
plans  to  take  a  leadership  role  in  the  sub-region  and  the  region,  and  perhaps  even  across  the 
continent, in favour of climate-compatible, carbon-lean development.

(iii) Energy saving sector: In the energy sector, strategies, programmes and plans are primarily geared 
towards low-carbon development based on new and renewable energy (NRE) sources. The goal is to 
redirect investment away from fossil fuels towards NRE as soon as possible. The following is a non-
exhaustive list of initiatives: hydro-electric construction at the Adjrarala Dam (start-up is imminent); 
pilot  programme  for  the  electrification  of  22  villages  equipped  with  solar  photo-voltaic  kits; 
distribution of 13,000 solar street lights, project for the construction of a 5 MW solar power plant by 
the  CEB  (Communauté  électrique  du  Benin)  at  Kara;  project  for  the  construction  of  a  20  MW  solar 
plant at Mango, with financing by the WAEMU; project  for connecting a 2*5 MW photo-voltaic solar 
array  to  the  network  (offers  being  considered  as  at  June  2015);  a  24  MW  wind  power  project  by 
Delta  Wind;  drafting  of  the  NREAP  and  the  NEEAP  with  support  from  the  ECOWAS  Centre  for 
Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency  (ECREEE);  distribution  of  400,000  low-cost  lamps;  rural 
electrification of 65 villages (phase 1) with Indian financing; project for the rural electrification of 20 
locales funded by BIE; project for the creation of a rural electrification agency.  
 
(iv)  Coastal  zone  sector:  Fighting  coastal  erosion  from  PK 11  to  PK  45;  strengthening  infrastructure 
resistance  to  climate change  in  coastal  zones; erosion  and  adaptation  in  the  coastal  zones  of  West 
Africa; strengthening community resilience to climate change in the coastal zone. 
 
(v)  Drinking  water  supply  sector:  To  date,  most  major  investments  are  concentrated  in  the  city  of 
Lomé, with the assistance of the AFD and the World Bank. 
 
(vi) Human settlement sector (buildings and city): urban development of Togo, phase II.
