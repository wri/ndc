UGANDA'S INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (INDC) 

 OCTOBER 2015 

FOREWORD 

Uganda,  is  a  signatory  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change 

(UNFCCC) and  is  one  of  the    Least  Developed    Countries.  Through regular  participation      in  the 

meetings  of  the  Conference  of  Parties  to  the  UNFCCC, Uganda  is keenly  following   the events 

leading  to  the  new  Climate  Change  Agreement  to  be  negotiated  in  Paris,  France  during    the   UN  

Climate Conference  in  December  2015. 

Uganda  has  contributed    least  to  the  potentially  catastrophic    build  up  of  the  human-derived 

greenhouse    gases  (GHGs)  in  the    atmosphere  and  yet    the    country    is  most    vulnerable    to 

global  warming   and  climate   change  impacts. (Uganda  has one  of  the  lowest  green-house gas 

emissions  per  capita  in  the  world, estimated at  1 . 3 9  tons  carbon  dioxide, far  below  the global 

average  of  approximately  7.99  tons  of  carbon  dioxide.  Furthermore,  Uganda's  contribution  t o  

world's  total green-house  emission  is estimated a t  0.099%). 

Consequently    Uganda  recognizes  the    importance    of  fulfilling      the  commitments      under  the 

respective   article   of   the   Convention    on   Climate   Change,   particularly    the   Principle   of 

"common  but  differentiated    responsibilities   and respective  capacities". 

The  actions   reflected     in  this    Intended   Nationally    Determined     Contribution     (INDC)  have 

been  derived  through    a  consultative    process  and  reflect  a  national    resolve  to  respond  to  the 

call  by  the    global    community      to    initiate    domestic    preparations    for    nationally    determined 

contributions   towards  curbing  temperature   rise to  below  2°C by the  end of  the  century. 

I a m  pleased to   convey  to  the  International Community  this  fulfilment  from  the  Government 
and the  People of  Uganda.

                                                     SUMMARY 

a)  Uganda  is  submitting  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  in 
compliance  with  Decision  1/CP.19  (Further  advancing  the  Durban  Platform: 
and in particular Paragraph 1 (b & c)) and as elaborated in  Decision 1/CP.20 
(Lima Call for Climate Action and in particular paragraph 11) premised on the 
Convention and guided by its principles.  

b)  The livelihood of the people of Uganda is highly dependent on the exploitation 
of her natural resources, including climate. In submitting this INDC, Uganda's 
priority  is  adaptation.  The  country  will  continue  to  work  on  reducing 
vulnerability  and  addressing  adaptation  in  agriculture  and  livestock,  forestry, 
infrastructure  (with  an  emphasis  on  human  settlements,  social  infrastructure 
and 
transport),  water,  energy,  health  and  disaster  risk  management.  
Sustainable  Land  Management  (SLM)  and  Climate  Smart  Agriculture  (CSA) 
will be scaled up to increase resilience at the grassroots level. 

c)  For  mitigation,  Uganda  is  to  focus  on  implementation  of  a  series  of  policies 
and  measures  in  the  energy  supply,  forestry  and  wetland  sectors.  In  the 
business-as-usual  (BAU)  scenario  the  estimated  emissions  in  2030  will  be 
77.3  Million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  per  year  (MtCO2eq/yr).The 
estimated  potential  cumulative  impact  of  the  policies  and  measures  could 
result in approximately 22% reduction of national   green house gas emissions 
in  2030  compared  to  business-as-usual.  Uganda  proposes  to  implement  the 
identified policies and measures, and their impact may be higher or lower than 
these estimations illustrate. 

d)  Contributions under this Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution include 
crosscutting  respect for human rights and gender-responsive climate change 
actions.  The  protection  of  vulnerable  groups, 
is  a 
crosscutting priority.  

including  women, 

e)  The  Government  of  Uganda  will  continue  to  commit  resources  to  climate 
change-relevant strategies. However, the full implementation of these actions 
is  conditional  on  the  support  of  international  community  coming  from  both 
climate finance instruments and international market mechanisms. As set out 
in the Uganda National Climate Change Policy and its Costed Implementation 
Strategy,  national  sources  are  assumed  to  cover  approximately  30%  of 
incremental costs of the activities in the next 15 years, with 70% assumed to 
originate from international sources. 

1. National Circumstances 

Uganda,  one  of  the  Least  Developed  Countries  (LDCs)  in  East  Africa,  occupies  an 
area of 241,038 square kilometres, with water bodies and wetlands covering about a 
third  of  it,  and  standing  astride  the  equator.  Its  tropical  climate  has  an  average 
temperature ranging from 18 to 28 degrees centigrade, and this provides the country 
with a rich natural resource base. With an average total fertility rate of 6 children per 
woman,  Uganda  has  an  annual  growth  rate  of  3.2  per  cent;  and  the  population  is 

 
expected  to  grow  from  34.8  million  people  in  2014  to  93.4  million  people  in  the 
2040s. In terms of capacity, as a  Least Developed Country, Uganda has a low per 
capita  income    of    United  States  dollars  584,  coming  from  economic  development 
that depends largely on natural resource.  

Uganda  has diverse  socio-economic  concerns  embedded  in  a multi-cultural  society 
with  a  multi-party  political  system  and  a  diversity  of  religious  practices.  Outlined  in 
Uganda's  Vision  2040,  Uganda's  aspirations  hinge  on  uplifting  the  quality  of  life 
through  transformation  of  Ugandan  society  from  "a  peasant  to  a  modern  and 
prosperous  nation".  Along  that  path  Uganda  not  only  fulfils  national  obligations 
enshrined  in  its  Constitution,  but  also  responds  to  the  agendas  of  a  global 
instrument, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to which 
the country, like other signatories, is a Party. 

 Uganda's  priority  is  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  its  population,  environment  and 
economy  by  implementing  adaptation  actions.  Uganda  also  intends  to  "implement 
strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emission development" in the 
context  of  its  development  goals.  These  mitigation  and  adaptation  intentions  are 
based  on  the  country's  National  Climate  Change  Policy  (NCCP)  (2015),  which  is 
derived from the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995, as amended in 2005 
and  2015)  and  reflects  Uganda  Vision  2040  (2012).  The  priorities  in  the  National 
Climate  Change  Policy  have  been  integrated  in  the  Second  National  Development 
Plan (NDP II) 2015/16 - 2019/2020 (2015). In the long term, Uganda intends to follow 
a  climate-resilient  and  low-carbon  development  path  linked  to  green  growth  and 
broader sustainable development goals. 

The  economy  of  Uganda  is  highly  depended  on  her  natural  resources,  making  the 
country vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Uganda is experiencing significant 
impacts of climate change, which include which include changing weather patterns,  drop in 
water  levels,  and  increased  frequency  of  extreme    weather  events.  The  emissions  of 
greenhouse  gases  resulting  from  human  activities  drives  climate  change.    Even  though 
Uganda's  emissions  are  low  the  country  is  fulfilling  her  obligations  to  contribute  to  the 
emission reductions, as reflected  in goal 13 of the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals.  

Uganda's  contribution  to  emission  reduction  is  multidimensional,  through  tree  planting, 
afforestation  and  reforestation  programmes,  and  all  these  contribute  to  emission  reduction 
through  carbon  sequestration,  and  other  benefits,  such  as  biodiversity  conservation,  as 
reflected in goal 15 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  

Uganda's  response  to  submit  her  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  has 
various  benefits  across  sectors.  In  the  Energy  sector,  for  example,  the  deficit 
experienced  in  the  past  decade  drove  the  country  into  using  unsustainable, 
expensive  and  polluting  thermal  generators  (diesel  and  heavy-fuel  oil).  Uganda's 
Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  opens  the  door  to  affordable  and 
modern  energy  as  inscribed  in  goal  seven  of  the  United  Nations  Sustainable 
Development Goals (UNSDGs).  Since 1960 mean annual temperatures have risen 

 
by  1.3ºC  and  annual  and  seasonal  rainfall  has  decreased  significantly  across 
Uganda.  Rainfall  has  also  become  more  unpredictable  and  evenly  distributed  over 
the year. Extreme events such as droughts, floods and landslides are increasing in 
frequency and intensity.  

Climate change is affecting a wide variety of sectors. Agriculture, water, health and 
human  settlements  have  been  particularly  affected.  In  the  2007-08  fiscal  year, 
climate change damages were equivalent to 4.4% of the national budget, exceeding 
the budget allocation for the Environment and Natural Resource Sector. 

Climate  projections  developed  for  the  country  using  the  models  used  in  the  IPCC 
Fifth  Assessment  Report  (IPCC  AR5)  indicate  an  increase  in  near-surface 
temperature  for  the  country  in  the  order  of  +2°C  in  the  next  50  years,  and  in  the 
order  of  +2.5°C  in  the  next  80  years  under  Representative  Concentration  Pathway 
(RCP) 4.5; and in the order of +2.5°C in the next 50 years, and in the order of +4.5°C 
in  the  next  80  years  under  RCP  8.5.  They  also  predict  a  slight  decrease  in  total 
annual  rainfall  in  most  of  the  country,  with  slightly  wetter  conditions  over  the  west 
and  north-west  under  both  RCP  4.5  and  RCP  8.5.  Rainfall  totals  might  drop 
significantly over Lake Victoria (-20% from present).  

Recent  studies,  which  require  further  refinement,  have  estimated  that,  in  the 
absence  of  adaptation  actions,  the  cost  of  the  impacts  of  climate  variability  and 
change  in  Uganda  would  range  between  United  States  dollars  270  and  332  billion 
over  the  40  year  period  2010-2050,  for  the  agriculture,  water,  infrastructure,  and 
energy sectors. Annual costs could be in the range of United States dollars 3.2 billion 
to United States dollars $5.6 billion within a decade in these four sectors alone. 

The rural poor and those living in slums are especially vulnerable as they have lower 
capacity  to  cope  with  and  adapt  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  Women  are 
especially  vulnerable  in  terms  of  food  insecurity,  water  shortage  and  fuel  wood 
scarcity.  Children,  the  elderly,  and  persons  with  disabilities  or  sick  are  also 
particularly vulnerable.  

Current and future impacts of climate change make adaptation urgent. As illustrated 
above, Uganda will continue to undertake adaptation initiatives. Uganda also intends 
to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  improving  climate  change  resilience  and 
moving  to  a  low-carbon  future,  and  will  rely  on  the  cooperation  between  the 
Government  of  Uganda  and  other  stakeholders.  As  explained  above,  the  full 
implementation  of  the  priority  adaptation  and  mitigation  strategies  is  conditional  on 
accessing  significant  external  support  (70%  of  the  additional  financial  resources 
required for the full implementation of this INDC are dependent on external support).  

So  far  international  climate  funds  have  played  a  very  small  role  in  climate  change 
adaptation and mitigation in Uganda. Although a number of them have been active in 
the  country  over  the  last  few  years,  levels  of  committed  funding  are  not  significant 
and  they  appear  not  to  have  been  disbursed  in  many  cases.  Only  around  US$ 
160,000  was  disbursed  over  the  period  2008/9  -  2011/12.    Most  of  it  has  been 
directed at mitigation actions.  

 
In  contrast,  traditional  development  partners  have  committed  substantial  funds 
towards  climate  change-related  activities 
in  Uganda.  The  seventeen  major 
adaptation projects that  have  been  implemented  since  2001  in  partnership  with  the 
Government of Uganda add up to approximately US$ 59 million. 

Climate  change-related  initiatives  will  continue  to  be  monitored.  The  effectiveness 
and  efficiency  of  the  implementation  of  the  NCCP  is  to  be  monitored  against  its 
approved  outcomes  and  outputs  on  an  annual  basis.  Information  from  ministries, 
departments  and  agencies  will  be  reported  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Planning  an 
Economic  Development  and  copied  to  the  National  Planning  Authority  and  the 
Climate  Change  Department,  which  will  prepare  a  consolidated  annual  progress 
report.  An

implementation of the NCCP. The recommendations will feed into the revision of the 
climate  change  policy,  which  should  be  informed  by  a  thorough  public  consultation 
process.

2. Adaptation to climate change 

2.1 Long-term goals  

Uganda  has  the  overarching  objective  of  ensuring  that  all  stakeholders  address 
climate  change  impacts  and  their  causes  through  appropriate  measures,  while 
promoting  sustainable  development  and  green  growth.  The  country  will  continue  to 
work  on  reducing  vulnerability  in  the  following  priority  sectors:  agriculture  and 
livestock,  forestry,  infrastructure  (with  an  emphasis  on  human  settlements,  social 
infrastructure and transport), water, energy and health. Disaster risk management is 
crosscutting for adaptation.

2.2 Current and near-term action 

Uganda has made notable progress in adaptation in recent years: 

*  Uganda's  National  Adaptation  Programme  of  Action  (NAPA)    was  submitted 
to  the  Secretariat  of  the    United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  
Change  in 2007;  

*  Approved  a  National  Policy  for  Disaster  Preparedness  and  Management  in 

2010;  

*  Developed  her  National  Climate  Change  Policy  and 

its  Costed 

Implementation Strategy in 2012/13;  

*  Has  taken  steps  to  integrate  climate  change  into  the  National  Development 

Plans, as well as in sectoral policies, plans and programmes; 

*  Has produced climate change mainstreaming guidelines.  
*  Some  efforts  have  also  been  made  in  research,  systematic  observation, 

education, training, public awareness and institutional strengthening.  

*  Specific activities have been developed on the ground to increase resilience, 

regarding, among others, agriculture, water and urban planning.  

*  Developed a 10-year Climate Smart Agriculture Program (2015-2025)  
*  A  road map for  the  development  of  the  National  Adaptation  Plan  (NAP)  was 
submitted to the Secretariat of the  United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate    Change    at  the  beginning  of  2015.  The  agricultural  sector  Natioanl 
Adaptation Plans process was launched in June 2015. 

*  The country will lay the ground for the National Adaptation Plans preparation 
during  2015,  and  will  finalize  it  ready  for  implementation  by  mid  2016.The 

 
process will also include the analysis of current and future climate variables, 
the  assessment  of  vulnerabilities  and  the  appraisal  of  adaptation  options, 
refining  the  priority  sectors  and  actions  mentioned  above.  The  National 
Adaptation  Plan  process  will  compile  and  communicate  priority  national 
adaptation plans by December 2016. 

 

3. Mitigation of climate change 

3.1 Mitigation contribution 

*  Uganda  aims  to  build  on  existing  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM) 
projects and Programmes of Activities pipeline, such as Bujagali Hydropower 
Project and Improved Cook Stove for East Africa.  

*  Uganda  commits  to  undertaking  a  number  of  policies  and  measures  to 

support low-carbon development in key priority sectors (Table 2).  

*  The implementation of these policies and measures assumes the continuation 
of  ongoing  and  planned  international  financial,  technology  transfer  and 
capacity  building  support  to  complement  domestic  efforts  as  set  out  in  the  
2015 National Climate Change Policy.  

*  The  estimated  impact  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions  for  these  policies  and 
measures  are  presented  in  Table  4  in  section  3.3  below,  under:  Potential 
mitigation impact.

3.2 Additional mitigation ambition 

* 

In  addition  to  the  prioritised  mitigation  efforts  outlined  above,  Uganda  is 
prepared to undertake additional mitigation activities (Table 3). 

The  implementation  of  these  additional  activities  is  contingent  upon  receipt  of 
sufficient  international  support,  provided  in  the  form  of  finance,  technology  and 
capacity  building.  Possible  support  could  be  accessed  through  various  climate 
finance instruments and international market mechanisms.

*  The  proposed  priority  measures  for  2030  build  upon  ongoing 
policies and plans, whose implementation will be accelerated in 
the period between 2016 and 2030. 

*  The  period  of  implementation  for  the  additional  measures  will 
be  2021  to  2030,  or  earlier  if  feasible  and  if  the  provision  of 
sufficient support is expedited. 

Estimations of potential mitigation impact are approximate, and are 
presented  for  indicative  purposes  only.  Uganda  proposes  to 
implement  the  aforementioned  policies  and  measures,  and  their 
impact  may  be  higher  or  lower  than  these  estimations  illustrate.

Scope and 
Coverage of 
Contribution 

*  The  mitigation  contribution  (section  3.1)  covers  the  energy 
(excluding  transport)  and  Land  Use  Land  Use  Change  and 
Forestry sectors, in particular forestry and wetlands.  

*  Combined,  the  energy  (excluding  transport)  and  Land  Use 
Land  Use  Change  and  Forestry  sectors  account 
for 
approximately 36% of national emissions in 2000,  and 26% of 
emissions  in  2030  under  Businee  As  Usual.  Under  the

and 
Methodology 

Forestry sector continues to be a net emitter. 

*  The  additional  mitigation  ambition  (section  3.2)  also  covers 

agriculture and transport. 

*  Combined,  the  transport  and  agriculture  sectors  represent  a 
further  62%  of  national  emissions  in  2000,  and  70%  of 
emissions in 2030 under Business As Usual. 

*  All  Greenhouse  Gases  s  are  considered  within  Greenhouse 
Gas  emission  estimates,  and  expressed  in  terms  of  their  tons 
carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO2e) throughout this document. 
 

*  Uganda's contribution is based upon the priority actions of the 
Second National Development Plan, the 2015 National Climate 
Change  Policy  and  its  Costed  Implementation  Strategy,  all  of 
which  were  approved  by  Government.  The  renewable  energy 
targets  are  based  on  energy  sector  investment  plans  of  the 
Ugandan Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development. 

*  The  prioritisation  of  policies  and  actions  has  undergone 
extensive  consultation  with  stakeholders  at  the  national  and 
sub-national level and represents the priorities of the Ugandan 
government.  

*  The  implementation  of  the  specific  policies  and  measures  is 
institutionalised  through  the  National  Climate  Change  Policy 
led by the authorities of the relevant sectors. 

*  Uganda's  national  greenhouse  gas  inventory  for  2000,  as 
outlined in the 2014 Second National Communication, uses the 
2006  Inter-governmental  Panel  on  Climate  Chang  (IPCC) 
Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas  inventories,  and 
global  warming  potential  values  from  the  Inter-governmental 
Panel on Climate Change's Second Assessment Report (SAR). 

*  Projections for Business As Usual emissions in 2025 and 2030 
are  estimated  through  the  use  of  the  learning,  evaluation  and 
planning  (LEAP)  model  according  to  projected  growth  rates 
and  demographic  trends,  as  highlighted  in  the  2014  Second 
National  Communication.  Due  to  the  relative  uncertainties  of 
these factors for Uganda, references to these projections in this 
Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  document  are 
indicative, and included for illustration purposes only. 

*  Net emissions of Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry are 
included  in  all  emission  statistics  in  the  Intended  Nationally 
Determined  Contribution  and 
the  2014  Second  National 
Communication unless stated otherwise. 

*  Net emissions from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry  

 
including  REDD+  in  2000  were  10.6  Million  tons  Carbon 
dioxide  equivalent,  including  removals  of  approximately  80 
Million tons carbon dioxide . 

*  The  calculations  of  the  estimated  mitigation  potential  for  the 
renewable  energy  and  forestry  sectors  are  based  on  Clean 
Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  methodologies  of  registered 
CDM projects in the sectors in Uganda. 

*  The  estimation  of  the  Greenhouse  Gas  reduction  in  the 

wetlands sector is based on international benchmarks. 

*  The  mitigation  measures  outlined  in  this  intended  contribution 
share  significant  interactions  with  the  national  development 
priorities  of  Uganda,  including  the  improvement  in  access  to 
energy  and  in  access  to  natural  ecosystem  services.  The 
measures are relevant to future revisions of the Energy Policy, 
the  Renewable  Energy  Policy,  the  National  Land  Use  Policy, 
and the National Climate Change Policy. 

 

3.4 Interaction with international market mechanisms   

*  Uganda intends to  meet its commitments and/or increase the level of its 

contribution through the use of international market mechanisms where 
appropriate, building upon the experience of the Clean Development 
Mechanism and other existing market mechanisms.  

 

4. Fairness, ambition and contribution towards achieving the objective of the 
Convention 

To develop a fair and ambitious contribution that helps achieve the objective of the 
Convention  but  recognises  Uganda's national  circumstances as a  Least  Developed 
Country,  Uganda  has  considered  how  it  can  prioritise  those  actions  and  measures 
that  achieve  emissions  reductions  while  ensuring 
increased  resilience  and 
development outcomes for Uganda.  

As  a  Least  Developed  Country  with  low  emissions  and  high  vulnerability  to  climate 
impacts,  Uganda's  ability  to  undertake  climate  action  without  external  support  is 
extremely low when compared to other countries. 

*  Uganda  has  one  of  the  lowest  greenhouse  gas  emissions  per  capita  in  the 
world,  at  approximately  1.39  Tons  Carbon  dioxide  equivalent  in  2011  (well 
below  the  global  average  of  approximately  7.99  Tons  Carbon  dioxide 

 
equivalent    and  even  below  the  average  of  Least  Developed  Countries  of  3 
tons Carbon dioxide equivalent ); 

*  Uganda  has  contributed  only  0.099%  of  the  world's  total  Greenhouse  Gas 
emissions  in  2011  (based  on  Climate  Analysis  Indicators  Tool  (CAIT)  data); 
and 

*  Uganda's  capacity  to  undertake  action  is  constrained  by  its  national 
circumstances and development priorities. It has a human development index 
(HDI)  Value  of  0.477(compared  to  the  global  average  of  0.698)  and  gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita of only 1,607 (2011 PPP $) (compared to 
the global average of 12,600 (2011 PPP $)). 

In light of these factors, Uganda's contribution is both fair and ambitious. It prioritises 
specific  measures  in  energy  supply,  forestry  and  wetlands  to  provide  both 
Greenhouse Gas emission reductions as well as development benefits. As of 2011, 
only 15% of Uganda's population had access to electricity. By committing to increase 
Uganda's  renewable  energy  generation  capacity  by  2030  and  prioritising  the 
construction  of  enabling  infrastructure  for  the  electricity  sector,  Uganda  is  not  only 
reducing  its  emissions  by  approximately  3.2  Million  tons  Carbon  dioxide  equivalent 
per year , but also enabling greater access to reliable and sustainable energy for the 
85% of Uganda's population that live in rural areas, in turn, improving the livelihoods 
and health of rural populations. 

Uganda's  greatest  mitigation  potential  is  in  the  land  use,  land-use  change  and 
forestry sectors. Reversing the current deforestation trend (of approximately 14% in 
2013)  to  increase  forest  cover  to  21%  in  2030  is  highly  ambitious  considering  that 
89.5%  of  the  country's  energy  needs  are  currently  met  by  charcoal  and  firewood. 
This  commitment  further  highlights  the  holistic  nature  of  Uganda's  contribution  - 
recognising  that  the  development  of  the  electricity  sector  is  key  to  achieving  the 
reduction in wood and charcoal burning necessary to reduce deforestation. 

In  addition,  by  focusing  on  these  policies  and  measures,  Uganda  will  also  ensure 
alignment with its long-term adaptation goals in terms of forest protection, reduction 
of the energy deficit and resilient energy infrastructure. By structuring its contribution 
in this way, Uganda is able to contribute to the global efforts to reduce Greenhouse 
Gas emissions and contribute to the achievement of the objective of the Convention, 
while at the same time addressing domestic development needs and priorities. 

Despite the ambition of Uganda's proposed contribution, additional assistance would 
enable  Uganda  to  increase  its  resilience  and  realise  greater  Greenhouse  Gas 
emissions reductions. Uganda's contribution therefore includes a range of additional 
measures  in  key  priority  sectors  based  on  the  potential  to  reduce  GHG  emissions, 
provide  development  benefits  and  adaptation  co-benefits.  An  example  of  one  of 
these  key  sectors  is  agriculture.  Approximately  80%  of  the  population  is  directly 
reliant  on  the  agricultural  sector  for  their  livelihood.  It  is  also  one  of  the  most 
vulnerable  to  climate  impacts,  and  represents  significant  additional  mitigation 
potential.   

 
Accessing  additional  support  to  achieve  the  measures  outlined  in  this  Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution would significantly increase the ability of Uganda 
to achieve more ambitious action in this and other key sectors. 

 

5. Means of implementation 

In  order  to  fully  implement  the  aforementioned  adaptation  and  mitigation  priority 
actions,  some  cross-cutting  initiatives  must  be  undertaken.  Capacity  building, 
technology  transfer  and  finance  are  the  most  important  needs  in  Uganda.  Specific 
national needs are: 

*  Access to and diffusion of appropriate clean  technologies;  
*  Promotion  of 

renewable  energies  and  energy  efficiency, 

including 

the 

involvement of the private sector;  

*  Research  into  climate  smart  and  sustainable  agricultural  practices,  including 

dissemination of good practices;  

*  Scaling up Climate Smart Agriculture 
* 

Improving national policies and legislation; enhancing climate change education, 
training and public awareness;  

*  Building of climate information systems;  
*  Setting up of public-private partnerships; and  
*  Mainstreaming gender into development policies, plans and strategies as well as 
observance  of  human  rights  in  all  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation 
actions 

In  this  context,  in  addition  to  the  specific  adaptation  and  mitigation  strategies 
included above, the Government of Uganda plans to: 

*  Promote and enhance climate change education, public awareness and capacity 
information  and  knowledge 

training, 

development  through  communication, 
management;  

*  Provide adequate support for policies and programmes that take into account the 
interactions  between  population  dynamics,  climate  change  and  development, 
including the link between the national and sub-national governments;  

*  Promote climate change research and development and information exchange in 

all sectors impacted on by climate change;  

*  Promote  and  encourage  the  development,  transfer  and  diffusion  of  climate 

technology; and  

*  Promote  and  encourage  the  mainstreaming  of  gender  considerations  in  climate 

change issues.  

The Government of Uganda will continue to commit significant resources to climate 
change-relevant  strategies.  Ugandan  communities,  private  sector  and  NGOs  can 
also  contribute  significantly  to  these  climate  change-related  activities,  for  instance 
through  public-private  partnerships  and  payment  for  ecosystem  services  schemes. 

 
However,  the  full  implementation  of the  priority  adaptation  and mitigation  actions  is 
conditional  on  the  support  of  international  stakeholders.  The  implementation  of  the 
prioritised  policies  and  actions  assume  the  continued  use  of  existing  and  planned 
national  and  international  financial  sources.  As  set  out  in  the  National  Climate 
Change Policy and Costed Implementation Strategy, national sources are assumed 
to  cover  approximately  30%  of  incremental  costs  of  the  activities  in  the  next  15 
years, with 70% assumed to originate from international sources. 

The National Climate Change Policy and Costed Implementation Strategy estimated 
that  Uganda  will  require  United  States dollars    2.9  billion  over  the  next  15  years  to 
address the impacts of climate change in addition to the existing  interventions. This 
represents approximately 1.2% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per 
annum over the next 15 years (GDP at market prices as of 2011).  

For adaptation: 

*  The total adaptation cost in the adaptation priority sectors is estimated at around 

United States dollars  2.4 billion over the next 15 years.  

*  During  the  next  five  years  (short  term)  the  cost  of  adaptation  in  these  eight 

sectors is estimated at around United States dollar  537.1 million.  

*  On an annual basis this amounts to $107.4 million, which is around 6.6% of net 
Overseas Development Assistance received by the country in 2013 and 4.2% of 
total government revenues (excluding grants) in 2012.  
In the future, the adaptation budgets in these sectors rise significantly: to United 
States dollars 936.8 million for 2021-2025 and United States dollars  932.1 million 
for 2026-2030.  

* 

*  Climate Smart Agriculture Programme (2015-2025) is estimated at United States  

476.0 million 
 

For mitigation: 

*  The total costs of the activities in the priority mitigation sectors are uncertain.  
*  The  upfront  capital  investment  for  the  renewable  energy  installations  has  been 

estimated at United States dollars  5.4 billion over the next 10 years.  

*  The initial costed plan for the National Climate Change Policy indicates costs of 
around  United  States  dollars    36  million  over  the  next  ten  years  for  the 
implementation of measures in the forestry sector.  

*  These  costs  will  be  adjusted  as  more  evidence-based  information  is  obtained 
(mainly  from  the  costed  national  Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and 
Forest Degradation Plus  (REDD+) Strategy).  

*  The  achievement  of  the  target  in  the  forestry  sector  assumes  continuation  of 
existing supported measures in the sector and in particular financial flows through 
the implementation of REDD+.  

*  The  costs  of  the  additional  policies  and  measures  are  included  in  the  above 
information where available, but will largely need to be assessed at a later stage.  

 
*  Uganda intends to meet its commitments and/or increase the level of its 
contribution through the use of international market mechanisms where 
appropriate, building upon the experience of the Clean Development  Mechanism 
and other existing market mechanisms.  

Annex I: Potential impact of the mitigation contribution 

This Annex provides further details for the emission reduction potential of Uganda's 
prioritized measures in energy supply, forestry and wetlands.  

The  estimations  are  approximate,  and  are  presented  for  indicative  purposes  only. 
Uganda proposes to implement the aforementioned policies and measures and their 
impact may be higher or lower than these estimations illustrate. 

As  shown  in  Figure  2,  the  cumulative  impact  of  these  measures  could  result  in 
approximately  22%  reduction  of  overall  national  emissions  in  2030,  including  Land 
Use  Land  Use  Change  and  Forestry,  compared  to  the  business-as-usual  (BAU) 
projection.  The  BAU  emissions  baseline  for  Uganda,  including  LULUCF,  is  77.3 
Million tons  Carbon dioxide equivalent per year  in 2030, according to projections in 
the Background Paper for the 2012 Climate Change Policy. Total emissions in 2000 
were 36.5 per annum  MtCO2e.

. 

Forestry 

The  proposed  afforestation  measures  will  reverse  the  trend  of  deforestation  and 
convert  the  Land  Use  Land  Use  Change  and  Forestry  sector  from  a  source  of  net 
emissions  (approximately.  8  Million  tons  Carbon  dioxide  equivalent  per    in  2030 
under  business-as-usual    to  a  source  of  net  removals  (approximately.  -11.7  Million 
tons  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  per  year  in  2030  under  the  Intended  Nationally 
Determined Contribution). The estimated range of net emission reductions compared 
to business-as-usual in 2030 is between 16.9 Million tons Carbon dioxide equivalent 
per year  and 22.2 Million tons Carbon dioxide equivalent per year. . 

Wetland restoration 

The proposed measures for wetland restoration will result in approximately 260,000 
hectares  of  new  or  restored  wetlands.  Due  to  the  uncertainty  about  the  potential 
methane  emissions,  the  annual  mitigation  impact  could  be  between  0.8  MtCO2e, 
and  net  zero.  For  the  aggregated  indication,  a  mid-point  value  of  0.4  MtCO2e  is 
taken.
