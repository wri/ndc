The  ambition  levels  associated  to  each  of  these  targets,  as  well  as  the  undertakings  necessary  to 
achieve them, are explained in the accompanying information.  An Annex is also submitted regarding 
Uruguay's total emissions and removals estimate by 2030, based on the above mentioned targets, for 
the UNFCCC Secretariat to prepare the synthesis report on the iNDCs. 

Uruguay will communicate its definitive Nationally Determined Contribution once the UNFCCC has set 
forth the rules to apply and implementation agreements have been finalized.  

 
 

On the presentation of Uruguay´s iNDC 

Uruguay is a developing country, whose economy should continue to grow to ensure higher 
equity levels in its society. Therefore, the country's contribution to the ultimate objective of 
the  Convention  focuses  on  continuing  its  development  with  the  lowest  emission  intensity 
possible while, at the same time, building resilience. 

With regard to the main activities (power generation and beef production), Uruguay presents 
specific indicators that show the desired efficiency level for the development of the activity. 
These indicators are presented as emission intensity per product unit, as detailed below. 

Uruguay  sets  forth  specific  targets  for  power  generation,  since  it  is  considered  the  main 
emitting  sector  worldwide.  These  targets  are  presented  as  emission  intensity  per  kWh 
produced.  

Additionally,  since  Uruguay  cannot  mitigate  climate  change  at  the  expense  of  food 
production, but rather work on improving the efficiency of the emissions per product in  the 
sector, the country sets forth specific targets for beef production. This activity accounts for 
78%  of  domestic  CH4  emissions  (due  to  enteric  fermentation)  and  63%  of  domestic  N2O 
emissions (due to manure left on pasture by grazing animals). These targets are presented as 
emission intensity per kilogram of beef (liveweight). 

For  all  the  other  emitting  sectors  and  economic  activities,  Uruguay  presents  aggregate 
indicators that show the desired efficiency level per GDP, except for the LULUCF sector, for 
which the iNDC presents the absolute annual CO2 removal value by 2030.  

Uruguay  presents  both  the  targets  that  could  be  achieved  by  means  of  the  country's 
domestic  resources,  as  well  as  those  that  could  be  achieved  if  additional  means  of 
implementation were to be provided by external sources, which would allow for an increase 
of  mitigation  capacities.  Further on, the  iNDC  outlines  the  additional  mitigation  actions the 
country would like to undertake if granted access to the necessary means of implementation. 
There  is  also  a  list  of  the  main  adaptation  actions  the  country  has  undertaken,  and  will 
continue  to  do  so  in  parallel  with  mitigation  actions,  promoting  synergy  between  the  two. 
Having  the  necessary  means  of  implementation  to  support  adaptation  actions  will  prove 
essential to meet the proposed mitigation targets.  

Finally,  in  2014  the  IPCC  pointed  outI  that  "the  GWP  metric  is  not  directly  related  to  a 
temperature limit, as the 2oC target, whereas some economic metrics and physical end-point 
metrics  like  the  GTP  may  be  more  suitable  for  this  purpose",  thus  calling  upon  further 
dialogue  on  the  implications  of  the  different  metrics  and  to  "provide  metrics  that  can  be 
useful to the users and policymakers". Due to the significant impact this discussion could have 
on  priority  assignment  concerning  mitigation  policies,  especially  with  regard  to  the 
agriculture sector, Uruguay has decided to submit its contribution sorted by gases.

National circumstances, global ambition and ambition levels by sector 

 

For  the  past  10  years  Uruguay  has  grown  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  5.4%.  During  this 
period, energy demands from the industrial sector increased threefold and food production 
was three and a half times greater. This growth brought along a significant decline in poverty 
rates,  from  39.9%  to  9.7%,  while  extreme  poverty  was  virtually  eradicated,  dropping  from 
4.7% to 0.3%, reaching a Gini Index of 0.38. 

Uruguay's production is heavily dependent on food production, and this sector accounts for 
70%  of  national  exports.  Uruguay's  total  agricultural  sector  currently  produces  food  for  28 
million people, while the country has a population of 3.3 million. 

Uruguay's food production is expected to continue growing in the future, since the country 
has particularly fertile soils, global demand is on the increase and the country is to contribute 
to global food security. This means that Uruguay's GHG inventory is, and will continue to be, 
heavily influenced by the emissions from the agriculture sector: following the GWP100 metric, 
this  sector  accounts  for  76%  of  current  emissions,  and  beef  production  accounts  for  three 
quarters of it.  

The country was able to undergo such a dynamic growth while reducing emissions intensity 
in all sectors, and for some of those it has even reduced absolute emissions, thanks to strong 
public  policies  on  climate  change,  a  new  institutional  framework,  both  at  national  and 
departmental level and thanks to the design of a National Climate Change Response Plan (in 
2009) and sector-specific policies. 

Below the iNDC provides a brief description of the recent evolution of the GHG emitting and 
removing sectors and activities, following the implementation of early mitigation measures, 
as well as 2030 ambition levels for each of the targets mentioned above.  

 

CO2 Removal - LULUCF 
Uruguay  is  a  country  with  no  net  deforestation;  this  is  quite  a  unique  attribute  among 
developing  countries.    The  total  coverage  of  native  forests  has,  actually,  increased  in  the 
past 30 years, and it is now 752000 hectares.  Carbon stocks in these forests have increased 
due to the  expansion of  the  area  and  due  to  secondary  growth,  in  about  one third  of the 
surface.  This  responds  to  legal  regulations  that  ban  native  forest  logging  and  to  tax 
exemption  incentives  provided  to  registered  areas  with  native  forests,  which  amounts  to 
approximately  USD  5  million  a  year.  By  2030  annual  CO2  removals  from  native  forests  by 
means of domestic resources are expected to be around 1300 Gg and up to 2500 Gg with 
additional  means  of  implementation.  Furthermore,  between  1990  and  2010  Uruguay 
afforested  689000  effective  hectares  with  tree  plantations,  which  accounts  for  a  430% 
increase  of  the  total  surface  planted  in  the  period.  Carbon  sequestration  levels  in  tree 
plantations and in growing native forests have determined that Uruguay, at the beginning of 
this century, behaved as a net CO2 sink. Uruguay expects to contribute, from 2010 to 2030, 
by means of domestic resources, with an additional expansion of the total tree plantation 
area of about 300000 hectares, which will account for total annual removals of 11200 Gg of 
CO2 in 2030.  
In  addition,  within  the  REDD+ framework,  Uruguay  will  be  able  to  contribute  by removing 
carbon and preventing emissions that could primarily be estimated in a further 2100 Gg of 
CO2 in 2030.  
The  aggregate  result  for  forestry  removals  supported  by  domestic  resources  amounts  to 

 
12500 Gg of CO2 in 2030, which could, reach 15800 Gg if provided with additional means of 
implementation. 
Additionally,  Uruguay  has  a  great  carbon  sequestration  potential  through  soils  under 
degraded  grasslands  and  eroded  croplands.  With  regard  to  degraded  grasslands,  removals 
by 2030 are estimated to be 600 Gg by means of domestic resources and a total of 3300 Gg 
with additional means of implementation. With regard to carbon in cropland soils, Uruguay 
has  broadly  introduced  no  till  agriculture,  and  has  recently  implemented  mandatory 
conservation policies that reduce erosion and will promote an increase in biomass supply to 
the soil. Moreover, it is fostering the use of irrigation. The net impact of these measures can 
initially be estimated at about 100 Gg CO2 captured by 2030.  
Uruguay would then remove, through carbon sequestration in soils, 700 Gg CO2 annually in 
2030 by means of domestic resources and a total of 3400 Gg  CO2 with additional means of 
implementation. 
 

CO2 Emissions - Energy (94% of CO2 emissions in 2010) 
Uruguay has made great efforts within the framework of the "National Energy Policy 2005-
2030",  to  achieve  a  clean  energy  mix:  59%  of  the  global  primary  energy  mix  is  currently 
renewable, which amounts to 83% for the total energy consumption of the industrial sector 
and  93%  for  power  generation  (2014).  With  regard  to  transport,  the  use  of  biodiesel 
accounts  for  7%  and  bioethanol  10%  of  the  total  vehicle  fleet,  both  with  entire  domestic 
production.  Even  though  a  lot of  progress  has been  made  in  the past years,  there are  still 
many opportunities for action in this sector. 
As  a  result,  the  total  emissions  of  the  country's  energy  sector  per  GDP  are  very  low:  the 
emission intensity of Uruguay's energy sector in 2014 was 111 g CO2/USD, one third of total 
global  intensity  (global  CO2  emissions  of  the  energy  sector  vs.  aggregate  global  GDP)  and 
significantly  lower  than  the  average  for  OECD  countries.  Moreover,  there  is  still  an 
important  reduction  potential,  especially  in  the  transport  sector  (see  below  for  list  of 
additional  mitigation  measures),  that  the  country  is  willing  to  implement  if  means  of 
implementation  were  to  be  made  available.  Uruguay  will  continue  to  develop  maintaining 
the  currently  low  emission  intensity  level  in  the  energy  sector,  and  even  achieving  an 
intensity reduction of 25% from 1990 values by 2030, by means of domestic resources, and a 
potential 40% total reduction with additional means of implementation. 
Power Generation 
Thanks  to  the  ongoing  structural  transformation  of  the  power  generation  mix,  by  2017 
Uruguay  will  achieve  an  absolute  emissions  reduction  of  88%  within  this  subsector 
compared to the annual average for the period 2005-2009, with a higher consumption. By 
2017, emissions from the domestic power generation system will be 17 g CO2/kWh, which 
accounts for 3% of the global average. This will be achieved with 40% of non-conventional 
renewable  energy  sources  (mainly  wind,  but  also  photovoltaic  and  biomass  waste),  in 
addition to 55% hydropower (estimating an average annual rainfall). 
Although this figure would increase in the following decades after reaching the hydro-wind 
complementation threshold, it could remain close to 2017 value, if storage systems were to 
be  incorporated  through  additional  means  of  implementation  (see  below  for  list  of 
additional mitigation measures). 
 

 
CO2 Emissions - Industrial Processes (6% of CO2 emissions in 2010) 
Uruguay  produces  CO2  in  industrial  processes,  mainly  related  to  cement  production.  The 
emissions  are  low,  even  when  compared  to  the  energy  sector's  low  emission  levels.  It  is 
possible  to  maintain  emission  intensity  close  to  1990  values  using  the  country's  own 
resources,  but  it  would  be  possible  to  reduce  it  by  up  to  40%  with  additional  means  of 
implementation. 
 
Net CO2 Emissions 
Thanks  to  the  removal  increase  by  LULUCF  and  to  low  emissions  by  the  energy  sector  in 
2030 Uruguay will be a net CO2 remover. (See Annex) 
 
CH4 Emissions - Beef production (78% of CH4 emissions in 2010) 
The  singular  biological  origin  of  these  emissions,  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  the  country 
cannot  mitigate  climate  change  at  the  expense  of  food  production,  poses  a  challenge  to 
focus on emissions intensity reduction per product unit of food produced.  
For  the  past  20  years  Uruguay  has  significantly  reduced  such  emission  intensity.  In 
particular, as a result of the 2010 Climate-Smart Agriculture Policy, Uruguay has made, and 
will  continue  to  make,  efforts  to  build  a  more  efficient,  resilient  and  low-carbon  cattle 
farming  sector,  by  introducing  new  technologies  and  incorporating  successful  experiences 
undertaken by other countries with similar characteristics. 
As  a  result  of  these  policies,  by  2030  Uruguay  expects  to  continue  reducing  emission 
intensity  in  beef  production,  expecting  to  reduce  CH4  emissions  intensity  per  kilogram  of 
beef (liveweight) by 33% from 1990 values, by means of domestic resources and a potential 
total  reduction  of  46%  if  adequate  additional  means  of  implementation  were  to  be  made 
available (see below for list of additional mitigation measures). 
 
CH4 Emissions - Waste (7% of CH4 emissions in 2010) 
With  regard  to  the  waste  sector,  even  though  different  methane  capture  and  flaring 
measures  have  been  implemented  in  landfills  (in  some  cases  with  power  generation)  and 
cogeneration from agroindustrial and forest waste, there is still an additional potential for 
mitigation.  The  continuation  of  these  policies  will  allow  for  a  reduction  of  the  emission 
intensity  of  the  sector  per  unit  of  GDP  of  44%,  from  1990  levels,  by  means  of  domestic 
resources, and a total 68% with additional means of implementation  (see below for list of 
additional mitigation measures).  
 
CH4 Emissions - Other sectors and activities (15% of CH4 emissions in 2010) 
Even  though  the  vast  majority  of  CH4  emissions  from  the  agriculture  sector  in  Uruguay 
respond to beef production, about 9% of domestic CH4 emissions respond to other livestock 
and diary productions, 5% to rice production and less than 1% are originated in the energy 
sector.  It is possible to reduce aggregate emissions intensity in these sectors per unit of GDP 
by 45%, from 1990 levels, by means of domestic resources, and a total 60% with additional 
means of implementation (see below for list of additional mitigation measures). 
 

 
N2O Emissions - Beef production (61% of N2O emissions in 2010) 
For  the  same  reasons  set  out  above  relating  to  CH4  emissions  in  beef  production,  the 
efforts regarding N2O emissions generated by this activity have focused on the reduction 
of emissions intensity per kilogram of liveweight produced. Based on the actions already 
taken, and those which will be further developed, by 2030 Uruguay expects to continue 
reducing  its  emissions  intensity  levels  in  beef  production,  expecting  to  reduce  N2O 
emission intensity per kilogram of beef (liveweight) by 31% from 1990 values, by means of 
domestic resources and a total potential reduction of 41% if adequate additional means 
of implementation were to be made available (see below for list of additional mitigation 
measures). 
 
N2O Emissions - Other sectors and activities (39% of N2O emissions in 2010) 
Even  though  the  majority  of  N2O  emissions  in  Uruguay  come  from  cattle  farming,  a 
significant part is originated in other activities connected to food production. It is possible 
to  reduce  aggregate  emissions  intensity  in  these  sectors  per  unit  of  GDP  by  40%,  from 
1990  levels,  by  means  of  domestic  resources,  and  a  total  55%  with  additional  means  of 
implementation (see below for list of additional mitigation measures). 
 
 

 

 

Uruguay  understands  that  the  targets  proposed  in  this  Intended  Nationally  Determined 
Contribution  are  ambitious  according  to  its  national  circumstances,  early  mitigation  efforts 
already undertaken and the characteristics of its economy.  

 

 

 

 
Additional mitigation measures 

 

As can be seen from the above, in order to contribute to the implementation of a new model 
of  resilient  and  low-carbon  development,  Uruguay  has  enforced  in  the  past  few  years  an 
ambitious set of early actions, particularly in several key sectors.   

This was possible thanks to a large volume of investments promoted by public policies. For 
example,  with  regard  to  the  energy  sector,  the  transformation  of  the  sector  was  possible 
through  a  public-private  investment  accumulated  for  several  years  which  reached,  on 
average, 3% of the GDP per year.  The State also contributed to reducing the emissions of the 
economy  by  granting  tax  benefits  to  investments  on  low-carbon  production  capacities, 
particularly to promote afforestation. In the sector, half the plantation costs were subsidized 
for  almost  15  years.  In  addition,  in  the  cattle  farming  sector,  dairy  farming  and  rice 
production,  public  policies  fostered  large  investments  and  technical  change,  which  allowed 
for an increase in productivity and a reduction in emission intensity. 

Additionally to the early actions already undertaken and the ones that will be implemented 
by  means  of  the  country's  own  resources,  Uruguay  is  still  willing  and  committed  to 
developing and executing innovative approaches, especially in the transport, waste and land 
sectors, to continue making progress towards a low-carbon economy. However, in addition 
to what has been stated above, the country needs to take on a significant number of actions 
to adapt to the strong impacts that climate change and variability are having on our territory, 
economy  and  population,  as  described  below.  Therefore,  in  order  to be  able  to  implement 
the  additional  set  of  mitigation  actions  that  have  been  identified,  Uruguay  needs  further 
means of implementation to be provided by external sources. 

 

Additional mitigation actions the country would like to undertake: 

- Reduce emissions intensity by enhancing productivity and efficiency in beef, dairy and rice 
production.  

- Reduce emissions intensity from manure left on pasture by grazing animals. 

- Increase the total coverage of tree plantations. 

- Increase the total coverage of native forests and reduce degradation. 

- Increase carbon stocks in soils under natural grasslands. 

- Increase land surface under irrigation. 

-  Reduce  methane  emission  in  rice  production  through  flood  management  and  other 
practices.  

- Efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers.  

- Incorporate energy storage systems to manage the wind power surplus. 

- Implement BRT corridors for metropolitan public transport. 

- Introduce electric and hybrid private and public vehicles. 

- Increase the percentage of biofuels in gasoline and diesel oil blends. 

- Introduce public and private vehicles that support a higher percentage of biofuel blends. 

 
-  Enhancement  of  the  vehicle  fleet  through  higher  power  efficiency  standards  and  lower 
emissions. 

-  Improve  cargo  transport,  through  the  incorporation  of  new  multimodal  systems,  and 
increased use of railroad and inland waterway transport 

- Introduce new technologies for emission reduction from cement manufacture. 

- Improve treatment and final disposal systems of solid urban waste.  

-  Improve  industrial  wastewater  treatment  systems  and  effluent  management  in  intensive 
animal farming establishments.  

- Improve industrial and agroindustrial solid waste management  
 

 

 
Adaptation actions required 

 

Uruguay's 2009 National Climate Change Response Plan states that adaptation is a strategic 
priority for the country.  This is essential to be able to effectively respond to climate change 
and  increased  climate  variability,  especially,  to  reduce  risks  and  damage  from  increasingly 
intense changes. Uruguay is highly sensitive to droughts, it has low-lying coastal areas, as well 
as areas which are prone to climate related disasters, such as floods.  Adaptation becomes 
particularly  important  when  it  comes  to  food  production,  which  is  a  core  activity  for  the 
domestic economy and is highly sensitive to climate. 

Within  this  context,  Uruguay  has,  through  the  implementation  of  public  policies,  been 
addressing adaptation to climate change and variability and climate risk management for the 
different  sectors,  both  at  national  and  subnational  levels  of  government  by  means  of 
domestic and external resources.  

In sectors such as cattle farming, agriculture and energy there has been a lot of progress in 
the  implementation  of  specific  adaptation  measures.  This  makes  it  possible  to  begin  the 
design of sector-specific National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) to identify adaptation needs in the 
medium and long term, and allowing for the development and implementation of strategies 
and programs, within the planning and development frameworks of these sectors. 

 

The main adaptation actions undertaken were: 

- Energy mix diversification to reduce vulnerability and cost overruns of the power system in 
case of hydropower generation deficits.  

- Development of climate index insurances and other financial instruments for risk reduction 
in the power sector. 

-  Design  and  implementation  of  adaptation  measures  in  cattle  production,  including  water 
sources, feed and rangeland management measures.  

-  Development  of  soil  use  and  management  plans  to  reduce  erosion  and  preservation  of 
organic matter in croplands. 

- Resettlement of population living in urban areas vulnerable to floods, and land-use planning 
 

measures to reduce the risk of floods. 

-  Monitoring  program  and  eradication  campaigns  for  the  Aedes  Aegypti  mosquito, 
strengthening  of  the  National  Immunization  Program  against  diseases  caused  by  climate 
sensitive vectors and other health communication and awareness raising activities. 

- Development and strengthening of the National Protected Areas System, which contributes 
to the protection of climate change and variability vulnerable biodiversity and ecosystems.  

- Restoration and maintenance of coastal ecosystems services that provide protection against 
extreme events and of ecosystems services that protect drinking water sources.  

-  Overhaul  and  maintenance  of  road  infrastructure,  especially  in  coastal/  flood  sensitive 
areas, taking into account climate change and variability.  

-  Development  of  research  and  data  collection programs  and  networks  on  the  impacts  and 
adaptation to climate change and variability. 

-  Development  of 
information  systems,  climate  services  and  monitoring  programs, 
particularly  for  the  environmental,  agriculture  and  emergency sectors,  and  development  of 
early warning systems, to support decision-making.   

- Development, strengthening and decentralization of the National Emergency System.  

- Strengthening of weather, climate and water services.  

implementation  of  the  National  Climate  Change  Response  Plan;  the 
-  Design  and 
Metropolitan  Climate  Plan;  Climate  Change  Adaptation  and  Development  Project  for  the 
agriculture sector; Integrated Water Resources Management National Plan within the climate 
change  and  variability  framework,  Land-use  Planning  programs  for  vulnerable  regions  and 
Stormwater Management Plans; Emergency and Sudden-impact Disasters Response Protocol; 
identification of  adaptation  measures  in the  tourism  sector  and development of  a National 
Adaptation Plan for the coastal sector.  

 

Building  on  the  experience  and  results  of  these  undertakings,  and  incorporating  new 
elements, by 2030 Uruguay expects to have accomplished the following adaptation actions, 
with  the  support  of  external  means  of  implementation,  which  are  necessary  to  ensure  the 
fulfillment of mitigation targets: 

-  Development  and  implementation  of  national,  regional  and  sector-specific  participatory 
climate  change  and  variability  adaptation  plans,  and  incorporation  of  monitoring  and 
reporting systems on adaptation and loss and damage. 

-  Development  of  new  early  warning  systems  and  new  hydrometeorological  insurances, 
within the disaster risk reduction framework for the agricultural, coastal and health sectors, 
and for flood sensitive urban areas, infrastructure and other vulnerable regions.    

-  Strengthen  climate  risk  management  against  floods,  through  the  enhancement  of 
vulnerable  population  resettlement  processes  and  the  implementation  of  new  land-use 
planning  measures.  Moreover,  with  regard  to  drought  management,  identification  of  new 
water  sources,  promote  the  construction  of  associative  works,  such  as  large  reservoirs  to 
serve various users, and improve efficiency in water use.  

- Improve the protection of surface and underground water sources, such as aquifer recharge 
areas, through the promotion of good drilling practices, point source and non-point sources 
pollution  control  and  the  implementation  of  conservation  and  restoration  measures  for 
gallery forests.     

 
-  Promote  ecosystem-based  adaptation,  strengthening  ecosystem  and  biodiversity 
conservation strategies.   

-  Design,  adapt  and  maintain  a  resilient  infrastructure,  considering  the  impact  of  climate 
change and variability. 

-  Articulate  and  develop  new  integrated  climate  services  and  information  systems,  for 
continuous  monitoring,  risk  mapping  and  loss  and  damage  evaluation,  by  strengthening 
academic,  monitoring  and  observation  institutions,  such  as  The  Uruguayan  Institute  of 
Meteorology and the National Water Management Service. 

-  Build  research,  development  and  innovation  capacities  to  enhance  domestic  response  to 
climate change and variability. 

-  Enhance  visibility  of  climate  change  adaptation  measures  within  the  allocations  of  the 
national budget, including the development of a national system of environmental indicators. 

-  Implement  education,  training  and  awareness  programs  that  address  climate  change 
response needs. 

 
 

 

 
Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding 

 

Scope and coverage: The contributions target all emitting sectors as acknowledged by IPCC 
inventory  guidelines  and  are  nationwide.    They  cover  CO2,  CH4  and  N2O  gases,  which 
collectively  account  for  99.7%  of  Uruguay's  current  CO2eq  emissions,  calculated  as  per 
GWP100 metric. 

Methodological approach for estimating emissions and removals: This Intended Nationally 
Determined Contribution was prepared using the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 2000 Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in 
National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventories,  2003  Good  Practice  Guidance  for  LULUCF,  as  well  as 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories for the waste sector.  

Time frame for the contributions: Targets are set by 2030, thus considering for this purpose 
the annual average of the 2028-2030 timeframe. 

Base year: Except for the LULUCF and power generation, the remaining targets take 1990 as 
reference values. 

Economic  Data: The  current  work  was  undertaken  based  on  a  country development  model 
that  does  not  entail  significant  structural  transformations  from  the  current  productive  mix, 
under the assumption of an average inter annual growth of 3% from 2014 to 2030.  

 

 
 

 
Annex for the UNFCCC Secretariat: 

Total estimated emissions and removals per gas by 2030 

To  facilitate  the  work  of  the  Secretariat  we  communicate  that,  based  on  the  assumptions 
considered for the development of this Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, it may 
be  estimated  that  Uruguay's  maximum  emission  levels  in  2030,  including  only  mitigation 
actions to be developed by means of domestic resources, would be: 

 

 
 

Gas 
CO2 emissions 
CO2 removals 
Net CO2 removals 
CH4 Emissions 
N2O Emissions 

(in Gg) 
10900 
-13200 
-2300 
840 
39 

As  can  be  observed,  Uruguay  expects  to  be  a  net  CO2  sink  by  2030.  In  addition,  based  on 
these estimates, we expect to maintain relatively stable levels of non-CO2 gases emissions by 
2030 compared to current values, despite an expected growth in the economy for the period 
of 60%. 

The figures in this Annex are presented as non-binding estimates, therefore, they shall not be 
construed as part of Uruguay's iNDC. These are only presented to facilitate the work of the 
UNFCCC  Secretariat  in  the  preparation  of  the  synthesis  report  on  the  aggregate  effect  of 
Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.
