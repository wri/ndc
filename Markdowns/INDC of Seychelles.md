 Republic of Seychelles 

 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) 
Under The United Nations Framework Convention On 

Climate Change (UNFCCC) 

 

September 2015 

 

1.  Introduction 

1.  The Republic of Seychelles is committed to the successful conclusion of negotiations under the Ad-
Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) in order to adopt, at COP21, 
a  new  legally-binding  agreement  under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
Change  (UNFCCC)  applicable  to  all  Parties,  which  will  come into  effect  and  be  implemented from 
2020. 
 
the  Republic  of  Seychelles  hereby 
In  accordance  with  decisions  1/CP.19  and  1/CP.20, 
communicates  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (INDC)  towards  achieving  the 
objective of the UNFCCC as set out in its Article 2, as well as accompanying information to facilitate 
clarity, transparency, and understanding of its INDC. The information is provided in tabular form that 
is accompanied by supporting documentation. 
 

2. 

3.  As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), the republic of Seychelles is vulnerable to the impacts of 
climate change and climate variability, and it gives priority concern for adaptation to climate change 
as communicated in this INDC. Given that the Republic of Seychelles is a net sink, its contributions 
to  climate  change  mitigation  to  contribute  towards  the  objectives  of  the  UNFCCC  will  be  the  co-
benefit of enhancing its energy security and reducing its energy bill. 

 

The Republic of Seychelles will reduce its economy-wide absolute GHG 

emissions by 122.5 ktCO2e (21.4%) in 2025 and estimated 188 ktCO2e in 2030 

(29.0%) relative to baseline emissions.

The cost of achieving the reduction objective (2030) has been estimated to be 

at least USD 309 million. Including the cost of energy efficiency measures 

such as building codes, standards and labels, and energy audits will increase 

the total cost of implementation, which is expected to be met partly through 

domestic funding and conditional on international climate financing including 

through the Green Climate Fund among others.

Planning process 

*  Planning processes for preparation of the INDC:  

The INDC was developed using a multi-stakeholder 

consultative process by engaging relevant stakeholders 

in and outside government. The INDC process involved 

several bilateral meetings and two rounds of national 

consultations, and it has highlighted synergies with other 

UNFCCC-related processes, including the Third National 

Communication (TNC), Biennial Update Reports (BURs), 

National Adaptation Planning (NAP), and Nationally 

Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), and technology 

Needs Assessment (TNA). The INDC process was 

coordinated by the Department of Energy and Climate 

Change (DECC), Ministry of Environment and Energy 

and Climate Change. The Cabinet of Ministers has been 

apprised of the validated INDC and they endorsed the 
INDC on 23rd September 2015, 

*  Planning processes for implementation and monitoring of 

the INDC: 

The overall implementation, and monitoring and evaluation 

of the INDC will be carried out by the Department Energy 

and Climate Change (DECC) of the Ministry of 

Environment, Energy and Climate Change, under the 

Chair of the National Focal Point for Climate Change who 

is also the Head of the DECC. 

Fair and ambitious 

The emissions of Seychelles are less than 0.003% of global 

emissions. Further, Seychelles are currently a net sink and 

under the Business-As-Usual scenario it is expected to become 

a net emitter between 2024 and 2025. In this context, the 

contribution of Seychelles is considered fair and ambitious. With 

our contribution, Seychelles will remain a net sink in 2030. The 

fairness of our contribution also relates to the fact that as a 

SIDS, adaptation is a higher priority for Seychelles.

3.  Adaptation Contribution 

4.   The Government of Seychelles considers adaptation to climate change as a  high priority to reduce 
the  country's  vulnerability.  The  cost  of  achieving  the  implementing  the  adaptation  contributions  
(2030) has been estimated to be at least USD 295 million. 

3.1 

Climate Change Trends, Impacts and Vulnerabilities 

5.  Seychelles  is  about  to  embark  on  its  Third  National  Communication  to  the  UNFCCC,  which  will 
eventually  produce  updated  findings  with  respect  to  climate  change  trends  and  projected  impacts.  
For now, existing data from the Second National Communication must be used to guide planning for 
climate change. The main climate change threats facing Seychelles are similar to those threatening 
other  small  island  developing  states:  changes  in  rainfall  patterns  leading  to  flooding, landslides  on 
one hand  and extended periods  of drought on the other, increases in  sea temperature, changes in 
acidity and damage to marine ecosystems, increases in storms and storm surges, and sea level rise 
during  the  longer  term.  Research  is  needed  to  better  understand  changes  in  cyclone  patterns, 
ocean  and  air  currents,  and  the  interplay  between  climate  change  and  other  climate  phenomena 
such as El Niño. 

 
6.  The  threats  caused  by  climate  change  will  have  significant  impacts  on  Seychelles  in  the  short, 
medium and longer term on infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, energy and water security, 
biodiversity, waste management and on human health and  well-being.  Although the exact impacts 
are  not  known,  and  more  research  is  needed  to  better  understand  the  implications  of  a  change 
global  climate  on  the islands,  it  is  critical that  Seychelles  take  measures  to better  understand 
the  threats  and  begin  longer-term  planning  for  adaptation.  All  national  plans  and  strategies  that 
address  climate  change  adaptation  consistently mention  Seychelles'  shortfalls  in  terms  of  capacity 
building and research. The National Climate Change Strategy (2009) addresses this specifically and, 
although  some  progress  has  been  made,  it  was  highlighted  at  the  stakeholder  workshop  that 
improved  gender-sensitive  capacity  building,  research  and  education  was  needed  to  underpin  all 
climate change adaptation efforts in order to make them effective and resilient. 

 
7.  Recent  studies  conducted  in  Seychelles,  by  research  partners  from  Cuba  and  Japan,  highlighted 
that much of the human activity is concentrated around the low-lying, coastal areas which are at the 
highest risk of flooding from heavy rainfall, storm surges, and sea level rise during the longer term.  
A  recent  UNISDR  report  has  revealed  that  most  disasters  occurring  in  Seychelles  were  related  to 
storms, floods,  rain  and  landslides,  and  recommended  that future  planning  should focus  on  losses 
from flooding and landslides which also caused the greatest economic losses.  The report also noted 
concern about lack of clear policy on the protection of critical infrastructure in the country, such 
as roads, ports, government buildings, energy generation, water distribution and sewerage systems. 

 
8.  A  Vulnerability/Resilience  Profile  exercise  undertaken  in  Seychelles  revealed  that  Seychelles  was 
most vulnerable  and  least  resilient in  terms  of  biodiversity  resources  and  sustainable  consumption 
and production (both with significant implications for climate change adaptation) the tourism industry 
(the country's crucial economic sector) and food security, Other areas of concern were sea level rise, 
coastal and marine resources, water security and energy security. 

 
9.  Seychelles vulnerabilities with respect to climate change are: 

 

*  Critical Infrastructure (roads, ports, government buildings, electricity, water and sewerage 

management systems); 

*  Tourism (in proximity to the coast or in areas vulnerable to flooding and landslide); 
*  Food Security (currently reliant on food imports, and need support for local sustainable and 

climate-smart agriculture and fisheries efforts); 

*  Coastal and Marine Resources (considering the aims of the Blue Economy and Seychelles 

Strategic Plan 2015); 

*  Water Security (particularly considering issues of storage and distribution); 
*  Energy Security (particularly considering the reliance on fossil fuels); 
*  Health (particularly addressing the burden placed on high-density populations in the coastal 

areas and general vulnerability to climate-sensitive diseases);  

4 

*  Waste (particularly for landfill sites in high risk, coastal locations); and 
*  Disaster preparedness (particularly addressing the need for more research to understand 

climate change impacts, and resources to predict, prevent and respond to disasters). 

 

3.2 

Statement of Long Term Vision 

10.  Seychelles'  long-term  vision  is  to  minimise  the  impacts  of  climate  change  through  concerted  and 
proactive  action  at  all levels  of  society.  This vision  is  nested  in  the  country's  broader  aspiration  of 
sustainable  development:  finding  strategies  to  realise  the  nation's  economic,  social  and  cultural 
potential  through  an  innovative,  knowledge-led  and  gender-sensitive  approach.  Seychelles' 
approach to climate change adaptation is guided by a collective understanding of the need to ensure 
that all actions taken must conserve the integrity of the Seychelles natural environment and heritage 
for present and future generations. 

 
11.  During the longer term, Seychelles' aims to: 

 

*  Advance understanding of climate change, its impacts and appropriate responses; 
*  Build gender-sensitive capacity and social empowerment at all levels to adequately respond 

to climate change;  

*  Put in place measures to adapt, build resilience and minimise vulnerability to the impacts of 

climate change, especially in critical sectors such as water, food and energy security, and 
disaster management; 

*  Develop policy direction and strategies to encourage and enhance action on technology 

development and transfer of cleaner technologies; and 

*  Scale-up financial resources and investment to support action on adaptation. 

 

3.3 

Statement of Current and Near-Term Planning and Action 

12.  Seychelles National Climate Change Strategy provides an overarching framework and direction for 
climate  change  adaptation  in  Seychelles.  This  plan  was  incorporated  into,  and  updated,  in  the 
Seychelles  Sustainable  Development  Strategy,  2012-2020,  Chapter  12,  which  provides  strategic 
goals  and  objectives  to  guide  adaptation  until  2020.    These  plans  called  for  the  mainstreaming  of 
climate change adaptation into all sectoral plans and this has progressed in several sectors including 
tourism,  health,  finance,  agriculture,  biodiversity,  fisheries,  disaster  management,  and  land-use 
planning. 

 
13.  More recently, climate change adaptation has been mainstreamed in the  Seychelles Strategic Plan 
(2015) which is the definitive document intended to guide land-use management during the next 25 
years (to 2040). The plan has been developed with reference to sectoral plans by various ministries 
and  is  intended  to  provide  an  integrated  framework  for  the  development  of  new  plans,  particularly 
regarding land use.  

14.  Also recently, the Seychelles Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2020) has been launched, 
and  includes  many  cross-sectoral  projects  with  climate  change  adaptation  implications.  Projects 
address  issues  such  as  sustainable  tourism,  watershed  management,  sustainable  agriculture  and 
fisheries, disaster planning, research and a shift toward ecosystem-based adaptation approaches to 
biodiversity conservation. 

15.  The Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change has recently restructured and created the 
new  Climate  Change  Division  which  will  serve  as  the  national  focal  point  for  climate  change 
adaptation  planning  and  implementation  of  projects.  The  University  of  Seychelles  has  recently 
established  the  Blue  Economy  Research  Institute  which  should  be  strengthened  and  fully  funded 
and  function  as  a  hub  for  climate  change  related  research.  Other  government ministries,  agencies 
and  civil  society  organisations  will  continue  to  contribute  to  adaptation  efforts  guided  by  their  own 
sectoral plans but in collaboration with the Ministry. 
 

16.  Moving  towards  the  longer-term  adaptation  goal,  the  main  actions  up  to  and  beyond  2030  are  to 
increase  resilience  and  reduce  vulnerability  of  livelihoods  and  island  life  with  respect  to  critical 
infrastructure,  tourism, food  security  coastal  and  marine  resources,  water  scarcity,  energy  security 
and health.

3.4 

Statement of Gaps, Barriers and Needs 

18.  Capacity Building, Education and Awareness - Much has been accomplished during the past ten 
years  to  educate  the  public  about  the  causes  and  impacts  of  climate  change,  and  mitigation  and 
efforts. While civil society is generally aware of the problem of climate change, much more work is 
needed  to  educate  different  stakeholder  groups  about  climate  change  adaptation measures  and  to 
help  them  develop  capacity  to  research,  develop  and  implement  these  and  other  appropriate 
strategies.    There  is  a  need  to  accelerate  efforts  to  integrate  climate  change  education  into  the 
school  curriculum  at  all  levels,  including  primary,  secondary  and  professional  centres  and  ensure 
that  adequate  attention  is  given  to  adaptation  measures.  On  a  more  fundamental  level,  there  is  a 
need for Seychelles to reinforce and enhance the quality of STEM (science, technology, engineering 
and  mathematics)  education  at  all  levels  to  develop  a  new  generation  more  capable  of  climate 
change  adaptation  leadership.  The  University  of  Seychelles  has  already  integrated  climate  change 
into the Environmental Science BSc programme, though needs more support to offer climate change 
specialist  training  at  diploma,  undergraduate  and  graduate  level  to  build  on  the,  currently,  very 
limited  group  of  climate  change  specialists  in  the  country.  In-service  training  is  also  needed  for 
teachers  and  other  professionals  working  in  diverse  sectors  (government,  private  sector  and  civil 
society) to help them integrate climate change adaptation measures into their work.  

19.  Research and Monitoring - Seychelles limited research and monitoring capacity for climate change 
reflects a challenge common to many islands with a small population. The establishment of the Blue 
Economy  Research  Institute  based  at  the  University  of  Seychelles  offers  new  opportunities  for 
research  into  and  monitoring  of  climate  change  adaptation  efforts,  though  requires  greater input  of 
financial  and  human  resources  to  meet  this  potential.    Many  government  sectoral  plans  and 
strategies  also  call for  research  and  monitoring  related  to  climate  change  adaptation  but  they  lack 
the  human  and  financial  resources  to  fully  undertake  this  task.  The  way  forward  will  include 
innovative approaches in partnerships between the University, local agencies and overseas research 
institutions.   
 

20.  Technology  -  In  many  cases,  Seychelles  lacks  the  technological  capacity  to  undertake  effective 
research  on  climate  change  modelling  and  risks,  monitoring  of  climate  change  impacts  and 

 

6 

implementation  of  adaptation  measures.  In  some  cases,  the  knowledge  may  be  there  but  the 
technology  is  prohibitively  expensive,  e.g.  in  terms  of  diversifying  away  from  fossil  fuels  for 
renewable energy, or protecting critical infrastructure. The way forward for these challenges will also 
include alliances with overseas partners including donors, a trend that has already been initiated by 
several  government  agencies  including Seychelles  Meteorological  Service,  the  Department  of  Risk 
and  Disaster  Management,  and  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Energy  and  Climate  Change.  The 
National Institute for Science, Technology and Innovation will reinforce the technological capacity to 
undertake effective research on climate change-related issues. 

21.  Legislation  -  Seychelles  is  already  in  the  process  of  revising  some  of  its  legislation  to  reflect 
emerging  sustainable  development  issues,  including  climate  change.    There  is  a  need  to  finalise 
amendments to the Town and Country Planning Act, and to enforce and provide resources as  well 
as for the new Disaster Risk Management Act. Other legislation may also need to be reviewed and 
amended in light of climate change adaptation needs. 

3.5 

Summary of Existing Support 

22.  General  support  includes  EUR  2  M  of  budgetary  support from  the Global  Climate  Change  Support 
Fund  which  was  awarded  to  the  Government  of  Seychelles  to  implement  aspects  of  the  National 
Climate Change Strategy, granted in 2010.More specific support includes: 
 
*  Ecosystem-Based Adaptation - Seychelles is currently implementing three ecosystem-based 
adaptation  projects  funded  by  the  GEF  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Fund,  UNEP  and  the 
Government of China. The projects focus on management of coastal ecosystems, protection of 
mangroves, and sustainable watershed management collectively; 

*  Water Security - Public Utilities Corporation is implementing a project to address deficiencies in 
water  security,  funded  by  a  loan  from  the  European  Investment  Bank  and  a  loan  from  the 
Agence Française de Développement and designed to address deficiencies in water security.  A 
further  loan  and  grant  of  about  EUR  20  M  from  the  African  Development  Bank  will  help  the 
Government  to  finance  part  of  the  Mahé  Sustainable  Water  Augmentation  Project  and  meet 
targets  as  set  out  in  the  2008-2030  Water  Development  Plan  supported  by  the  African Water 
Facility. The project will address water supply to the residential, commercial and tourism sectors; 
*  Food  Security  -  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Fisheries  and  its  associated  parastatals 
(Seychelles  Agriculture  Agency  and  the  Seychelles  Fishing  Authority)  have  been  receiving 
support  from  donors  including  the  African  Development  Bank,  the  International  Fund  for 
Agriculture  Development,  the  Japanese  Government  and  others  to  help  work  towards  more 
sustainable agriculture and fisheries and contribute to improving food and nutrition security; 

*  Energy  Security  -  Seychelles  is  currently  implementing  two  GEF-funded  projects  focused  on 
solar photovoltaic energy and energy efficiency, both of which address energy security issues in 
terms  of  electricity.  The  European  Union  funded  the  development  of  a  new  Energy  Act  which 
has paved the way for the integration of renewable energy sources into the electricity grid. The 
United Arab Emirates donated a wind farm to Seychelles in 2013 to help diversify the electricity 
supply; 

*  Disaster  and  Risk  Management  -  Seychelles  has  received  assistance  from  the  regional 
European Union funded Islands Project and other sources to support an improvement in disaster 
preparedness and communication with the public and the private sector. A Cuban research team 
and  Japan-funded  study  have  assisted  Seychelles  with  disaster  and  risk  modelling  related  to 
climate change; and 

*  Education  and  Capacity  Building  -  Many  government  and  civil  society  partners  have 
contributed to  an  ongoing  climate  change  education  programme targeting  schools,  the  general 
public,  artists,  and  professions  from  diverse  sectors.  For instance,  the  University  of  Seychelles 
has partnered  with local and overseas institutions to develop its Environmental Science degree 
programme. 

3.6 

Description of Monitoring and Implementation Plans 

23.  The  process  of  implementing  the  Vision  to  build  gender-sensitive  capacity,  education  and 
awareness,  research  and  monitoring  across  critical  sectors  will  be  nationally  monitored,  reviewed, 
updated,  and  reported  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Energy  and  Climate  Change  and  will  be 
focused on short-term monitoring of activities and processes, and outputs rather than on longer-term 
outcomes.  
 

7 

 

 

24.  The  National  Climate  Change  Committee  is  a  multi-stakeholder  group  chaired  by  the  Ministry  and 
about to embark on the Third National Communication. The committee will function as the main body 
to  coordinate  and  monitor  implementation  of  climate  change  adaptation  projects,  and  identify 
emerging gaps and opportunities for further action. 
 

25.  An indicative monitoring plan is elaborated in the Supplementary Information which will be monitored 
by  the  Climate  Change  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Energy  and  Climate  Change.  This 
will be aligned with the Department of Public Administration initiative (Monitoring and Evaluation and 
Administrative Governance) which is being introduced across all ministries to facilitate ministry-wide 
monitoring.

MITIGATION 
 
The Voluntary Initiatives of Seychelles 
 
The  Republic  of  Seychelles  has  developed  strategic  tools  for  the  sustainability  of  its  development  and 
economic reforms, such as Seychelles National Climate Change Strategy, 2009. The Strategy has five 
priority objectives to:  
 

*  Advance understanding of climate change, its impacts and appropriate responses;  
*  Put in place measures to adapt, build resilience and minimise the country's vulnerability;  
*  Achieve sustainable energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;  
*  Mainstream climate change considerations into national policies, strategies and plans; and 
*  Build capacity and social empowerment at all levels.  

 
The Energy Policy that was proposed in 2010 has set a target for 15% of energy supply to be met from 
renewable  energy  sources  in  2030.  The  expected  target  in  2020  is  5%.  In  the  long  term,  the  Policy 
envisages  that  100%  of  energy  supply  will  be  from  renewable  energy  sources.  Discussions  with  the 
Seychelles Energy Commission (SEC) have revealed that these targets are now being applied primarily 
to  the  power  sector  rather  than  being  applied to  primary  energy  supply.  The  Policy  has  also  proposed 
the adoption of demand side energy efficiency practices that would decrease the energy intensity by at 
least 10% in 2020. 
 
The Mitigation Context of Seychelles 
 
The mitigation  assessments  have  been  guided  by  the fact  that Seychelles  is  an  insignificant  emitter  of 
GHGs by world standard as it accounted for only 0.001% of the global emissions of GHGs in 2000, and 
less than 0.003% of world emissions in 2011. Further, excluding the offsetting capacity of ocean biomass 
and marine ecosystems (or blue carbon), Seychelles was a net sink of GHGs in 2000 at -564,232 tCO2e 
according to the Second National Communication (SNC), 2011. Accordingly, Seychelles is not expected 
to become a net emitter of GHGs before 2025. Voluntary emission reductions will only postpone the time 
when Seychelles will become a net emitter. 

According  to  the  SNC,  ~95%  of  all  national  emissions  took  place  in  the  energy  sector  in  2000.  The 
remaining 5% of national emissions  was accounted by forestry. The generation of public electricity and 
transport  accounted  for  82.0%  and  82.8%  of  all  emissions  in  2000  and  2007,  respectively.  Public 
electricity  and  transport  are  therefore  priority  sectors  for  emissions  reductions.  In  2000,  emissions 
related to fuel combustion in cooking represented 6% of national emissions. These values show that the 
priority sector for mitigation is the energy sector, of which public electricity and transport are significant 
potential sub-sectors for GHG emission reductions. 

 

Emissions from industrial processes and agriculture are insignificant in Seychelles. The emissions from 
agriculture were deemed to be so insignificant that the SNC mentions that it might not be necessary to 
calculate emissions from agriculture in the future. Concerning forestry, it was estimated that 8,000 m 3 of 
biomass was harvested annually amounting to an annual emission of 12,540 tCO2. In contrast, the sink 
capacity of forests was 837,380 tCO2 with an expected loss in sink capacity of 1% every 5 years. Solid 
waste generated some 2,510 tCH4 in 2000 (SNC, 2011).

In  Seychelles,  climate  change  mitigation  to  stabilize  the  climate  system  is  not  a  primary  objective. 
Mitigation is rather seen as an important outcome or by-product of decreasing the country's dependence 
on  imported  fossil  fuels  (i.e.  increase  in  energy  security),  and  to  enhance  its  balance  of  trade  profile 
(through a reduction in its energy bill) (Seychelles National Climate Change Strategy, 2009). The energy 
bill of Seychelles represented 25.15% of its total import bill in 2014. Except for the generation of 2.15% 
of  renewable  electricity  in  2014,  all the  other  energy  needs  of  the  Seychelles  were  met from imported 
fossil fuels. 
 
GHG Emissions Scenarios 
 
Non-GHG Outcomes in Public Electricity and Transport 
The  Energy  Policy  2010  has  provided  guidance  regarding  energy  use  scenarios  in  the  power  sector 
(electricity production and consumption) and transport to 2030. 
 
Electricity Generation 
It  is  estimated,  that  the  renewable  energy  sources  described  above,  together  with  the  necessary 
legislation, can contribute with 15% - 20% renewable  energy in the supply matrix in 2030. Wind power 
and, in the longer term, PV, are expected to contribute substantially. 
 
Electricity Consumption 
It is estimated that implementation of the policies outlined here has the potential to save 15%  - 30% of 
electricity consumption towards 2030 compared to the baseline.  
 
Transport 
Keeping a high penetration of public transport, targeting fuel efficiency and biofuels in import regulation, 
and  moving  towards  electric  vehicles  and  two-wheelers,  have  the  potential  to  reduce  oil  imports  for 
transport purposes by 15% to 30% (or perhaps more) by 2030 compared to the baseline. 
 
Public Electricity 
Concerning electricity demand, the SEC has carried out projections of electricity to 2035 under different 
GDP growth rate and energy efficiency scenarios using Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED). 
These  are  summarised  in  the  schematic  below. The Reference  (Ref),  Low  and  High  scenarios  refer to 
annual GDP growth rates of 5%, 3% and 6%, respectively. The Energy Efficiency (EE) scenario is one 
where  the  annual  energy  intensity  drops  by  20%  compared  to  10%  in  the  Reference  scenario.  This 
scenario is based on the Reference scenario (scenario 1) with a GDP growth rate of 5% per year, except 
that in Industry the energy intensity will decrease by 20% per year in all the sub-sectors of industry for 
motor  fuel  uses,  electricity  specific  uses  and  thermal  uses  except  in  Agriculture  and  Others  in 
Manufacturing.  This is due to energy efficiency improvement and technology innovation which are likely 
to occur in the next 25 years. 
 

*  The implementation of a National Energy Efficiency Programme includes the following activities: 
*  Promotion of energy-efficient appliances: target of10% energy savings in 2035 
*  Promotion of solar water heating: target of 80% of needs in Households, and 80% in Services by 

2035, 

*  New Regulations on the use of air-conditioning, target of 20% energy savings in the service 

sector, 

*  New Building Code for Household dwellings (features natural ventilation, roof insulation,..), 

target  of 50% energy savings on fans & AC in households by 2035, 

*  Promotion of cogeneration (production of hot water from waste heat from electricity generation) 

in hotels, target to cover 20% of hot water needs by 2035. 

 
It is assumed that for the period of the study 2010-2035, the population will grow at a constant rate of 1% 
per  year,  corresponding  to  the  annual  average  growth  rate  (AAGR)  for  the  preceding  10  years.  It  is 
assumed that the structure of the GDP is the same as for 2010 throughout the study period 2010-2035.

The SEC has revealed that the realistic non-GHG targets that have been proposed in the Energy Policy 
2010  should  be  15%  for  diversification  of  electricity  generation  using  renewables  by  2030,  and  to 
achieve the energy efficiency scenario given in the figure above. 
 
In  order  to  calculate  the  emission  reduction  potentials  of these  non-GHG  targets  applied  to  the  MAED 
scenario  projections,  the  grid  emission  factor  of  Seychelles  has  been  calculated  using  the  Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) Methodological Tool 07 - i.e. "Tool to calculate the emission factor for 
an electricity system (Version 04.0)". For electricity supply diversification from renewable energy sources 
that  are  intermittent  such  as  wind  and  solar  PV,  the  combined  margin  emission  factor  has  been 
calculated  as  0.67887  tCO2/MWh.  For  all  other  renewable  energy  sources  and  end  use  energy 
efficiency, the combined margin emission factor has been calculated as 0.65936 tCO2/MWh. 
 
GHG Emission Reductions from Supply Side Diversification and Energy Efficiency 
Since  the  supply  side  diversification  in  Seychelles  is  expected  to  be  primarily  from  solar  PV  and  wind 
energy  (as  per  the  proposal  made in  the  Energy  Policy  2010),  the  combined margin  emission factor = 
0.67887  has  been  applied  to  convert  the  non-GHG  target  of  15%  renewables  in  the  electricity  mix  in 
2030 into the equivalent amount of GHG emissions. Similarly, the emission factor = 0.65936 tCO2/MWh 
has been applied to obtain the emission reductions associated with demand side energy efficiency gains. 
The  GHG  emission  scenarios  were  calculated  using  a  combination  of  the  Reference  scenario  and  the 
non-GHG targets of 15% RE and 15.5% EE in 2030. 
 

 
 
Transport 
Projections  have  been  made  in  the  SNC  regarding  the  increase  in  baseline  emissions  from  road 
transport sector from 66, 525 tCO2 in 2005 to 167,087 tCO2 in 2030. The projections correspond to an 
increase  in  the  number  of vehicles  from  10,622  in  2005  to  20,000  in  2030.  Fossil  fuel  consumption  is 
expected to increase from 21,324 t (2005) to 53,620 t in 2030. Using a target  of 30% reduction in fuel 
use, which is expected to produce a proportional decrease in GHG emissions, the total emissions arising 

 

10 

from  road  transport  is  expected  to  be  116.96  ktCO2 in  2030.  This  target  corresponds  to  a  reduction  in 
emission  of  50.13  ktCO2  in  2030.  Assuming  a  target  of  18%  for  2025,  the  corresponding  emission 
reduction is expected to be 26.5 ktCO2. 
 
Project-based Approach 
 
The  climate  change  mitigation  contribution  of  Seychelles  has  been  calculated  using  a  combination  of 
outcome- and project-based approaches, while avoiding double accounting. There are projects that are 
not  captured  in  the  outcome  targets  discussed  above,  and  which  might  be  implemented  after  2020. 
Examples  of  such  projects  are  solid  waste  management  and  end-use  energy  efficiency  in  the  water 
sector that is not captured in the EE scenario that is discussed above. The EE in the water sector are not 
included in the INDC because most measures are expected to be implemented before 2020. 
 
Solid Waste Management 
Data  regarding  methane  (CH4)  emissions  from  the  old  landfill  in  Mahe  was  provided  by  the  SEC. 
Currently, the emissions are not captured neither for flaring nor for electricity generation. The projected 
emissions profile of CH4 is shown in the figure below for the period covering 2012 and 2030. The INDC 
has included a conservative scenario where only 50% of the emissions are captured for flaring. There is 
currently no provision for power generation using the captured emissions. 
 

 

 

 

Seychelles as a Net Sink 
 
According  to  the  SNC  (2011),  Seychelles  is  currently  a  net  sink.  With  GHG  emissions  projected  to 
increase  from  310,816  tCO2 in  2005  to  911,985  tCO2 in  2030,  and its  removal  capacity  decrease  from 
813,780 tCO2 in 2005 to 773,896 tCO2 in 2030, Seychelles is not expected to become a net emitter until 
2024-2025.  The  reduction  in  sink  capacity  is  projected  to  take  place  by  1%  every  5  years,  and  it  is 
assumed  that  this  cannot  be  avoided  since  reclaiming  land  for  built-up  areas  (to  protect  forests)  has 
proved to be too costly (SNC, 2011).  
 
By taking into account the emission reductions arising from (1) RE and EE (i.e. 124 ktCO2e in 2030), (2) 
land transport (i.e. 50.13 ktCO2e by 2030), and (3) methane capture and flaring from the old landfill (i.e. 
13.91 ktCO2e by 2030), the total emissions in 2030 can be reduced by 188 ktCO2e - i.e. the contribution 
of Seychelles. With this contribution, Seychelles will be a net sink of GHGs by about 50 ktCO2 in 2030, 
and it will become a net emitter only after 2033. These calculations do not take into account the potential 
for additional sinks in the form of marine ecosystems - i.e. blue carbon (Seychelles Strategic Plan 2040, 
2015).  
 
In 2025, the emission reductions against the baseline scenarios have been calculated at 122.5 ktCO2 - 
RE and EE = 79 ktCO2, land transport = 26.5 ktCO2, and methane capture = 17 ktCO2.

ADAPTATION 
 
To support the Statement of Long-Term Vision  
 
Another essential component of overall country resilience to climate change is recognising and planning 
for Critical Infrastructure, particularly roads, ports, government buildings, energy generation, and water 
and  sewerage  management  systems. Building  capacity  in managing  the  country's  critical  infrastructure 
requires  clear  linkages  between  responsible  Government  entities,  a  responsive  education  and 
awareness  programme  targeting  infrastructure  users,  supported  by  appropriate  research,  and  followed 
by reflexive monitoring.  

 

Climate change adaptation needs to be mainstreamed into planning process for all new developments, 
with associated improvements in the building codes and their rigorous enforcement. A critical role is that 
of the Department of Risk and Disaster Management which needs upgrading in capacity with enhanced 
mapping underpinned  with commensurate internet bandwidth. The Department should be linked in real 
time  to  Seychelles  Meteorological  Service  to  assist  in  understanding  risks  and  hazards,  improving 
emergency response system, whilst engaging directly with, and empowering, communities and islands to 
plan, mitigate risks and respond. 

 

The  key  economic  sector  is  Tourism  and  this  sector  requires  nimble,  adaptive  responses,  particularly 
where  its  success  is  predicated  on  proximity  to  the  coastal  or  island  areas.  Tourism  tends  naturally  to 
adapt  to  market  forces  and  the  suitability  of  the  tourism  offering  for  the  future  will  need  not  only  to 
recognise market pressures  but also those driven by climate change. Consequently, it will be essential 
that  the  Blue  Economy  Research  Institute  in  conjunction  with  the  National  Institute  of  Science, 
Technology  and  Innovation  produces  relevant  products  that  enable  the  tourism  sector  to  respond  in  a 
timely fashion.  

 

Adaptive  responses  may  include  expanding  marine  tourism  (yachts,  ocean-based  experiences)  and 
mountain  tourism  (away  from  the  coast).  Greater  co-management  of  the  sector  by  the  Ministry  of 
Tourism and Department of Risk and Disaster Management as well as with the Ministry of Environment, 
Energy and Climate Change. 

 

Food Security has been recognised by the Government as a crucial issue and it is  widely understood 
within Government and agreed that there are clear linkages between water, food, ecosystem health and 
well-being of the people. Seychelles is in the process of implementing an ecosystem-based approach to 
watershed management and its implications for foods supply as well as water security.  The Ministry of 
Agriculture  and  Fisheries  is  currently  working  on  a  feasibility  study  for  a  project  to  improve  food  and 
nutrition security and this project also addresses issues of water and soil management with reference to 
climate change. 

 

The  Ministry  recognises  that  sustainable modern  agriculture  requires  new  and  innovative  technologies, 
and investment supported by skilled and qualified human resources. The Ministry anticipates additional 
resources  being  committed  to  enhance  human  capacity  development  at  the  Seychelles  Agricultural 
Agency,  revitalising  the  extension  services  and  also  providing  opportunities  for  young  Seychellois  to 
study  climate-smart  and  ecosystem-based  approaches  to  agriculture,  put  in  place  programmes  for 
sustainable industrial and artisanal fisheries, sustainable mariculture, promote home gardening, improve 
port  infrastructure  for  artisanal  and  industrial  fisheries,  reduce  illegal,  unreported  and  unregulated 
activities; and continue to support the insurance scheme for farmers and fishers. 
 
With  so  much  territory  protected  from  human  land  use  and  with  a  remarkably  narrow  coastal  strip, 
Seychelles  has  real  challenges  in  designing  a  future  to  take  into  account  climate  change  which  has 
jurisdiction  over  the  entire  coastal  strip  through,  storm  surge,  high  winds  and  salty  air.  Much  has  been 
made  of  the  "blue  economy"  and for islands  that  would  seem  to  be  a  logical  consideration.  Seychelles 
needs to fast-track its blue-economy ambition into action so that it can develop innovative and additive 
links with the Seychelles Strategic Plan 2015 which is in its closing formulation. For island states, it is too 
short-sighted in terms of climate change and island development to orchestrate land use plans  without 
due consideration of the primary engine ~ the blue economy.  
 
A  current  Marine  Spatial  Planning  project  underway  also  has  potential  to  coordinate  connections 
between  different  interests  in  the  blue  economy,  biodiversity,  whether  they  be  conservationist  or 
exploitative in nature.   

12 

The  issue  remains  that  little  research  has  been  done  regarding  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on 
Seychelles'  fisheries,  both  industrial  and  artisanal,  and  more  research  will  provide  valuable  insights  to 
guide adaptation strategies for the fishing sector.  

 

With  50%  of  Seychelles  under  protection,  that  is  an  enviable  basis  for  the  future.  The  newly-launched 
Seychelles  Biodiversity  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  addresses  climate  change  as  a  cross-cutting  theme 
and  identifies  a  series  of  projects  to improve  biodiversity  conservation  though  cross-referencing issues 
such as water and food security.  A new Biodiversity law is currently being drafted which will update the 
existing laws related to the protection of biodiversity and strengthening of the capacity of those charged 
with  their  protection.  There  is  a  need  to  balance  protected  areas  and  room  for  development  whilst 
developing  a  strong  capacity  for  biosecurity.  Such  requirements  offer  ideal  scope  to  inform  a 
strengthened Blue Economy Research Institute. 

 

Water Security, particularly considering issues of storage and distribution, requires urgent attention and 
needs to take into account projected population growth, whilst reducing demand for treated water, using 
more  rainwater,  improving  efficiency  of  the  distribution  system,  and  improving  water  storage  capacity. 
Increasing  water  demand  from  the  residential,  commercial,  agriculture,  and  tourism  sectors  is 
exacerbated by changes in rainfall patterns and a limited water storage capacity. The ecosystem-based 
watershed project mentioned previously is currently being implemented to address water supply from an 
ecosystem  perspective.  Another  demonstration  project  is  being  implemented  on  La  Digue  focused  on 
integrated  water  resource  management.  Both  of  these  projects  represent  an  integrated  approach  to 
water security that address issues such as ecosystem health, waste management, water treatment and 
supply,  sewage,  agriculture,  etc.  It  is  advocated  that  this  approach  is  mainstreamed  throughout  island 
water  resource  management.    In  addition,  the  Public  Utilities  Corporation  is  currently  implementing  a 
project  to  improve  water  security  by  increasing  efficiency  of  the  system  and  reducing  demand  from 
consumers.  This  project  also  addresses  the  linkages  between  the  treated  water  system  and  energy 
efficiency.  It  is  essential  that  these  endeavours  are  linked  to  the  Blue  Economy  Research  Institute  to 
optimise knowledge-sharing and research throughout Government. 

 

Energy  Security,  particularly  considering  the  reliance  on  fossil  fuels  is  vital  to  the  longer-term 
sustainability of Seychelles. There is a need to keep the options for diversifying electricity sources under 
continual  review,  whilst  exploring  more  opportunities  for  the  application  of  renewable  energy 
technologies and strategies for using waste as an energy form. Commensurate with this, the distribution 
grid needs to maintain flexibility, and plans engaged to move critical infrastructure out of flooding/storm 
surge risk areas. Whilst the introduction of renewables is a usual early thought that has to be cautioned 
with detailed feasibility studies, innovations are possible, though require well-programmed research. 

 

Mechanised  transport  is  essential  given  the  terrain  of Seychelles.  This  currently  relies  on  fossil-fuelled 
vehicles and infrastructure that is degraded. Both require upgrading as these are critical and underpin all 
other  sectors  ~  moving  people  to  school,  work  and  shops.  The  departments  responsible  for  road 
maintenance and repair in case of flooding, erosion and landslides collaborate to  some degree to deal 
with  crises,  but  a  strengthening  of  cooperation  between  them  in  term  of  troubleshooting  and  planning 
would be desirable (e.g. Seychelles Land Transport Agency, the Department of Transport, Department 
of Risk and Disaster Management and the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change). 

 

The Health burden due to high-density populations in the coastal areas  needs to be managed through 
improved research, response and planning. There are known challenges within the coastal zone related 
to chemical and solid waste.  
 
The conventional waste hierarchy (reduce, re-use, recycle) should be implemented fully and the use of 
organic waste for soil improvement promoted. Traditionally, on Seychelles, waste management has been 
mostly  about  disposal  rather  than  looking  at  waste  as  an  opportunity  (especially  through  the  circular 
economy). Seychelles has a relatively new waste policy (2013) which highlights the waste hierarchy with 
landfill being the last option, though for most forms of waste this may be the only option. 
 
Waste management sites are located in the limited coastal area on all three main islands; the new landfill 
on Mahé has been designed to collect leachate though this is only expected to last five to six years and 
thus far there is no plan or location identified for the next landfill.  There is growing interest in business 
opportunities presented by recycling by the private sector, and this movement is being supported by the 
Government as well as by civil society organisations. The Government is conducting feasibility studies to 
look at the potential of a waste to energy facility, which would probably take the form of a biogas plant. 

13 

 

To support the Statement of Current and Near-Term Planning and Action 
 
The Department of Risk and Disaster Management has mainstreamed climate change concerns into its 
work  and  is  guided  by  a  new  policy  and  law  (Disaster  Risk  Management  Act,  2015)  that  provide  clear 
guidance.  The  Department  is  receiving  some  support  under  various  funding  programmes  but  requires 
more  input  in  terms  of  human  and  financial  resources  to  fulfil  the  mandate  as  guided  by  the  National 
Progress Report on The Implementation of the Hyogo Framework For Action (2013-2015) which details 
many  actions  focusing  on  building  capacity in  communities  and  districts  to  prepare  for  and  respond  to 
disaster  (climate  change  mediated)  events.  In  addition,  the    Seychelles  National  Disaster  Risk  Policy 
(2014) provides several areas for near-term action: Establishing sound, integrated and functional legal and 
institutional  capacity  for  total  disaster  risk  management  in  Seychelles;  Improving  risk  identification, 
assessment and monitoring mechanisms in Seychelles; Reducing the underlying risk and vulnerability factors 
by  improving  disaster  risk  management  applications  at  all  levels;  Strengthening  disaster  preparedness  for 
effective  response  and  recovery  practices  at  all  levels;  and  Enhancing  information  and  knowledge 
management for disaster risk management. 
 
The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Fisheries  is  looking  at food  security issues,  including  nutritional issues, 
and  has  developed  a  Food  and  Nutrition  Security  Policy  as  well  as  an  investment  plan.  The  Ministry 
recognises  that  sustainable  modern  agriculture  requires  new  and  innovative  technologies,  and 
investment  supported  by  skilled  and  qualified  human  resources.  The  Ministry  anticipates  additional 
resources being committed to enhance human capacity development at Seychelles Agricultural Agency, 
revitalising  the  extension  services  and  also  providing  opportunities  for  young  Seychellois  to  study 
climate-smart agriculture technologies.  
 
The  Ministry  of  Education  has  recently  integrated  climate  change  into  the  secondary  geography 
curriculum, and climate change issues are often addressed in extra-curricular school activities in primary 
(wildlife clubs) and secondary schools. Climate change has also been addressed in the programmes of 
many of the professional centres. The Ministry has the opportunity to identify opportunities for building on 
the  work  already  being  done,  particular  with  respect  to  adaptation  strategies  related  to  the  different 
sectors. 

 

The Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, through its  Seychelles Energy Policy (2010-
2030) outlines key strategies for energy security and has a ten-year outlook and action plans for energy 
security,  efficiency,  renewable  energy  (as  documented  in  the  Seychelles  Sustainable  Development 
Strategy, Volume 2, Chapter 11 - Energy and Transport). Many of the planned projects are underway, 
the Energy Act is in force and has paved the way for the introduction of power supplied to the grid from 
diverse  sources.    Two  GEF  projects  are  being  implemented,  focused  on  energy  efficiency  and  solar 
photovoltaic, both of which will also contribute significantly to an improvement in the energy security of 
Seychelles. 

 

The  Ministry  of  Tourism  has  a  master  plan  (2012  -2020)  which  indicates  its  focus  on  climate  change 
where appropriate. The priorities for sustainable tourism are documented in the Seychelles Sustainable 
Development  Strategy,  Volume  2,  Chapter  8  -  Tourism  and  include:  Minimising  negative  impacts  of 
tourism  on  environment  (and  society)  generally;  and  addressing  climate  change  through  training  of 
tourism environmental representatives, training of the Seychelles Tourism Board in sustainable tourism 
development and training of environmental conservationists. 
 
The Ministry of Land Use and Habitat is largely guided by the Seychelles Strategic Plan (2015) which is 
the  definitive  document  intended  to  guide  land  use  management  during  the  next  25  years  to  2040. 
Climate  change  adaptation  is  a  cross-cutting  theme  with  maps/plans  for  areas  for  growth  showing  intense 
areas of development along east coast of Mahé including the Victoria area. There is little mention of risks due 
to sea level rise and storm surges and the plans contradict predictions from the Cuban Study projections (map 
chapter 3) which could be addressed through further research as indicated previously. 

 

The Ministry of Health recently developed a Seychelles National Climate Change and Health Adaptation 
Plan  of  Action  (2014-2018)  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Energy  and  Climate 
Change.  This plan will foster closer ties between the two ministries and guide adaptation efforts related 
to public health. 
 
The National Institute of Science, Technology and Innovation (NISTI) is a newly-enacted body under the 
Ministry  of  Investment, Entrepreneurial  Development and  Business  Innovation.  It  has  an  oversight  and 

14 

leadership mandate with regards to the growth and development of science, technology and innovation 
across  all  sectors  and  programmes,  and  has  potential  to  contribute  to  climate  change  mitigation  and 
adaptation action. Also of interest, is that it has been  mandated to assist the transition to a Seychelles 
knowledge-based economy between now and 2026.

The cost of achieving the reduction objective in 2030 has been estimated to be at least USD 309 million 
as  detailed  in  Table  1.  Including  the  cost  of  energy  efficiency  measures  such  as  building  codes, 
standards  and  labels,  and  energy  audits  will  increase  the  total  cost  of  implementation.  The  cost  of 
emission reductions does not include the implementation of a biofuel policy in the transport sector, nor 
does it include any actions related to the decongestion of Victoria, Mahé.

1 As per the Energy Policy 2010, the target of 15% renewable electricity in 2030 is met predominantly using 

solar PV 

2  The  capital  cost  of  1  MW  installed  of  solar  PV  has  been  assumed  to  be  USD  1.75  million,  while  the 

operation & maintenance cost has been taken as 19,000 USD/MW/yr.

Cost of priority Adaptation Actions 
 
The threats caused by climate change will have significant impacts on Seychelles in the short, medium and 
longer  term  on  infrastructure,  agriculture,  fisheries,  tourism,  energy  and  water  security,  biodiversity,  waste 
management  and  on  human  health  and  well-being.   Although  the  exact  impacts  are  not  known,  and  more 
research is needed to better understand the implications of a change global climate on the islands, it is that 
Seychelles take measures to better understand the threats and begin longer-term planning for adaptation as 
depicted in the table below. Hence, the total cost of implementing the adaptation component of the INDC is 
estimated to exceed USD 295 million.
