INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION   

FROM THE PLURINATIONAL STATE OF BOLIVIA 

 

         

 

 

In accordance with the relevant paragraphs of Decisions 1 / CP.19 and 1 / CP.20, Bolivia 
communicates  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (INDC),  conditional  to 
the new climate agreement to be approved at the COP 21 effectively reflects article 4.7 of 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which states: 
"  ...  the  extent  to  which  developing  country  Parties  will  effectively  implement  their 
commitments  under  the  Convention  will  depend  on  the  effective  implementation  by 
developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial 
resources  and  transfer  of  technology  and  will  take  fully  into  account  that  economic  and 
social  development  and  poverty  eradication  are  the  first  and  overriding  priorities  of  the 
developing country Parties."   
 
Respecting  and  demanding  compliance  with  the  UNFCCC,  the  Plurinational  State  of 
Bolivia  observed  the  intention  of  several  Annex  I  countries  to  standardize  the  emission 
reduction  responsibilities  eliminating  the  principle  of  Common  but  Differentiated 
Responsibility, through the figure of a standard "contribution" for all countries, regardless 
of the historical responsibility, as well as limiting responsibility for the provision of means 
of implementation under article 4.7 of the UNFCCC aforementioned. 
 
Therefore,  in  Warsaw  COP19  the  Plurinational  State  of  Bolivia  submitted  a  "LEGAL 
INTERPRETATION"  in  regards  to  the  INDC,  stating  that  to  Bolivia,  decision 
FCCC/ADP/  2013/L.4/Add.1  should  be  applied  in  strict  accordance  to  Article  4,  in 
particular paragraph 7 of the Convention. 
 
Consequently,  the  contribution  made  by  Bolivia  applies  under  strict  compliance  with 
Article 4.7 of the UNFCCC. 
 
Bolivia's  contribution  bears  into  account  that  the  new  climate  agreement  must  be 
developed  over  the  basis  of  the  vision  of  the  peoples  and  social  organizations,  to  be 
revealed  in  the  conclusions  of  World  People's  Conference  on  Climate  Change  and  the 
Defence of Life in October 2015, rejecting in turn the vision of empires and transnational 
corporations, paving the way for a solution to the climate crisis from another alternative to 
the current view. 
 
The structural cause that has triggered the climate crisis is the failed capitalist system. The 
capitalist  system  promotes  consumerism,  warmongering  and  commercialism,  causing  the 
destruction  of  Mother  Earth  and  humanity.  The  capitalist  system  is  a  system  of  death. 
Hence,  capitalism  is  leading  humanity  towards  a  horizon  of  destruction  that  sentences

website.   
nature and life itself to death. In this regard, for a lasting solution to the climate crisis we 
must destroy capitalism. 
 
The capitalist system seeks profit without limits, strengthens the divorce between human 
beings  and  nature;  establishing  a  logic  of  domination  of  men  against  nature  and  among 
human beings, transforming water, earth, the environment, the human genome, ancestral 
cultures, biodiversity, justice and ethics into goods. In this regard, the economic system of 
capitalism privatizes the common good, commodifies life, exploits human beings, plunders 
natural resources and destroys the material and spiritual wealth of the people. 
 
Thus,  Bolivia  presents  its  intended  contribution  consistent  with  its  vision  of  holistic 
development, according to the provisions of the State Constitution, Law No. 071 of The 
Rights of Mother Earth and Law N° 300 of Mother Earth and Integral Development to   
Live Well, guided by the 2025 Patriotic Bicentennial Agenda and its 13 pillars, as well as 
national plans for medium and long-term. 
 
Bolivia  understands  Living  Well  as  the  civilizational  and  cultural  horizon  alternative  to 
capitalism,  linked  to  a  holistic  and  comprehensive  vision  that  prioritizes  the  scope  of 
holistic  development  in  harmony  with  nature  and  as  structural  solution  to  the  global 
climate crisis. Living Well is expressed in the complementarity of the rights of peoples to 
live free of poverty and the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights and the 
rights of Mother Earth, which integrates the indivisible community of all systems life and 
living,  interrelated,  interdependent  and  complementary  beings  who  share  a  common 
destiny. 
 
Distribution of global emissions budget 
Protecting the integrity of Mother Earth, and especially the rights to regeneration in the 
context of climate change can be achieved through the distribution of the budget surplus 
of carbon emissions and greenhouse gases among all countries of the world in the context 
of climate justice criteria. 
 
The  climate  crisis  which  we  live  has  been  generated  by  the  exploitation  of  atmospheric 
space by and in favor of developed countries, as expressed in the third paragraph of the 
UNFCCC,  "Noting  that  the  largest  share  of  historical  and  current  global  emissions  of 
greenhouse  gases  has  originated  in  developed  countries,  that  per  capita  emissions  in 
developing  countries  are  still  relatively  low  and  that  the  share  of  global  emissions 
originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs."   
 
The AR5 IPCC report states that a total of 2,000 GtCO2 were emitted between 1750 and 
2010,  1,160  correspond  to  the  member  countries  of  the  Organization  for  Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD)    till 1990 and the transition economies, in other 
words Annex I countries. 
 
Much  of  the  corresponding  non-  Annex  I  emissions  during  historical  periods  of 
colonialism and neo- colonialism favored the enrichment of the industrial and imperialist 
countries; configuring a climate colonialism expressed through the control of atmospheric 
space.

website.   
Country contributions should be consistent with the recognition of historical responsibility 
and as expressed in paragraph 2 of decision 1 / CP18 " ... the efforts of the parties should 
be  made  on  the  basis  of  equity  and  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and 
respective capabilities ... and should take into account the imperatives of equitable access 
to  sustainable  development,  the  survival  of  countries  and  protecting  the  integrity  of 
Mother Earth. " 
 
Bolivia has proposed a fair and equitable sharing of atmospheric space, taking into account 
the  capacity  for  regeneration  and  protection  of  the  integrity  of  Mother  Earth.  To  not 
exceed 1.5 degree temperature by 2050, the budget set by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) is 650 GtCO2. In order to implement the distribution of remaining 
carbon budget that would ensure the stabilization of concentrations of greenhouse gases in 
the  atmosphere,  Bolivia  has  proposed  a  Climate  Justice  Index  for  the  fair  and  equitable 
sharing of the global emissions budget; moreover this means of distribution would impart 
the carbon budget based on the following indicators: 
 
a)  Historical  responsibility.  Includes  responsibility  for  the  cumulative  emissions  since  the 

pre-industrial era (1750-2010). 

b)  Ecological Footprint. A calculation based on the amount of land, water and forest people 
of the countries need to satisfy all the goods consumed and to assimilate the waste they 
generate. 

c)  Capacity development. Represents the conditions of economic and social development of 

each country. 

d)  Technological  capacity.  Measures  the  ability  of  countries  considering  their  technological 
development  based  on  expenditures  on  Research  &  Development  and  industrial 
performance of each of them, considering their capacity to produce and export goods 
with high technology. 

 
This index fairly determines the effort required by each country to stay within the budget 
of  remaining  emissions  that  corresponds  to  them.  This  implies  that  countries  with  high 
historical  responsibility,  high  ecological  footprints,  greater  development  and  greater 
technological capabilities, have a smaller share of the budget. 
 
As a result of implementing the Bolivian index proposal, non- Annex I countries would 
have  a  total  of  89%  of  the  budget  and  Annex  I  countries  only  11%.  Also,  to  perform 
monitoring  and  sanction  non-compliance  with  international  commitments  involves 
establishing an International Climate Justice Tribunal. 
 
National Circumstances   
Bolivia has all the climates of the intertropical zone, from tropical climate in the plains to 
polar climate— as it reaches the high mountains, thus the impacts of climate change are 
diverse. During the past 50 years, the country has lost about 50% of the glacier surface and 
higher temperatures and stronger precipitation events are expected during the rainy season, 
which  will  expose  different  regions  of  the  country  to  prolonged  dry  periods  and  an 
increase  in  the  frequency  and  magnitude  of  floods,  flash  floods,  hailstorms,  overflowing

website.   
rivers, landslides and frost. The effects are evident in the social sectors (health, education, 
housing), economic (agriculture and industry) and infrastructure and services, which affect 
the way of life and production of the most vulnerable populations. 
 
From  1982  to  2014,  more  than  4  million  people  have  been  directly  affected  by  these 
phenomena,  reaching  about  40%  of  the  population  with  an  economic  impact  between 
1-2%  of  GDP,  depending  on  the  severity  of  the  weather  event.  By  2030,  27%  of  the 
country could be affected by persistent drought and 24% with highly recurrent floods. 
 
Extreme  poverty  in  Bolivia  reached  17.3%  of  the  population  in  2015,  and  this  will  be 
erradicated by 2025. However, this is not possible if there are no actions to fully develop 
the  national  economy  and  reduce  the  impacts  of  change  climate.  Thus,  Bolivia  has 
prioritized  a  linkage  of  mitigation  and  adaptation  actions  in  complementarity  with  the 
holistic  development  in  the  areas  of  water,  energy,  forests  and  agriculture  as  part  of  its 
2025 Patriotic Agenda, and national development plans. 
 
Bolivia has launched programs "My Water" and "My Irrigation" that have led to increased 
drinking  water  coverage  to  90%  inurban  areas  and  61%  inrural  area  by  2012,  and  in 
relation to irrigation, irrigation coverage has increased to 362,000 hectares by 2014, on the 
basis of comprehensive and community management of water resources. In the immediate 
future,  Bolivia  plans  to  implement  multipurpose  hydro  projects  to  enable  coverage  of 
irrigation and water storage capacity in the country and thereby strengthening adaptation to 
climate change. 
 
Bolivia has large forest areas, with 52.5 million hectares in 2015. In Bolivia, forests provide 
livelihoods  for  communities  and  small  producers  and  their  environmental  functions 
promote and contribute to the living well of urban and rural populations. Protected areas in 
Bolivia  cover  22.5%  of  the  national  territory,  of  which  17  million  hectares  are  under 
national jurisdiction. Bolivia considers that forests facilitate the provision of environmental 
functions,  strengthen  food  security  and  livelihoods  of  local  and  national  population  in  a 
complementary  manner  and  promote  timber  and  non-timber  forest  production  and 
agroforestry systems, consolidating their contribution to development of the country. Thus 
forests contribute jointly to mitigation and adaptation to climate change. 
 
With regard to agricultural production, Bolivia faces the challenge of expanding the area of 
food  production  in  areas  with  agricultural  potential  mindful  of  environmental  functions 
and promoting community and small farmers production. To date, Bolivia has an area of 
3.5  million  hectares  for  agricultural  production  and  2.2  million  hectares  for  livestock 
production, which represents 5% of the country. Small farms and communities comprise a 
total  of  57%  of  the  titled  area,  33%  owned  by  the  State,  including  protected  areas  and 
public land, and 9% are medium and large properties. Thus, agricultural production with 
the  participation  of  smallholders  and  communities  has  an  important  contribution  to 
climate change adaptation. 
 
With regard to energy, Bolivia has increased access to electricity to 82% of the population 
in  national  average,  and  plans  to  achieve  universal  electricity  coverage  by  2025.  Energy 
development is a key factor in expanding economic diversification, producing renewable 
energy and improving energy efficiency. Electric power will become one of the generators

website.   
of  wealth  for  Bolivians  through  investments  in  hydropower  and  alternative  energy.  This 
will  also  increase  the  export  capacity  of  energy  from  renewable  sources  to  neighbouring 
countries. Therefore, energy is an important part of efforts to mitigate climate change. 
 
Bolivian Context for actions on mitigation and adaptation to climate change 
 
Living  Well  with  the  vision  of  holistic  development  in  which  the  Intended  Nationally 
Determined  Contribution  of  Bolivia  is  based  on,  includes  the  construction  of  a  holistic 
human  being  without  material,  social  and  spiritual  poverty;  universal  access  of  the 
population to all basic services, in the context of the human right to water; a social and 
community  production  model  that  generates  wealth  and  redistributes  it  to  build  a  more 
equal  society;  productive  growth  based  on  diversification  by  strengthening  the  energy, 
agriculture  and  tourism,  and  boosting  oil  and  mining  sectors  with  industrialization; 
roadside, railway and river integration of the country, connecting populations and the flow 
of  goods  between  the  Atlantic  Ocean  and  Pacific  Ocean;  and  an  environmental 
management  model  for  living  systems  to  eradicate  poverty,  fully  develop  the  local  and 
national  economies  in  a  complementary  way  with  the  conservation  of  environmental 
functions and the development of sustainable production systems. 
 
Bolivia  considers  that  it  must  make  fair  and  ambitious  efforts  to  address  the  impacts  of 
climate  change,  although  it  has  not  caused  the  phenomenon  of  global  warming.  Also, 
Bolivia defines its national contribution in the context of the 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals and its 169 goals, which are part of the new development agenda, from a holistic 
view of the commitments, to be implemented voluntarily by each State and framed by the 
Political  Declaration  of  the  General  Assembly  resolution  document.  The  fight  against 
climate change for sustainable and harmonious development with nature on the basis of 
management systems life is present in this vision.   
 
This contribution responds to the application of a holistic approach to the construction of 
Living  Well  with  joint  impacts  of  mitigation  and  adaptation  to  climate  change  and  takes 
place in a context of expanding the productive capacity of the country with diversification 
in  the  fields  of  agriculture  and  energy  as  sustainable  sources  of  income  for  the  country, 
strengthening  the  environmental  functions,  and  the  role  of  forests  in  the  integral 
development, eradicating poverty as the basis of living well.   
 
Bolivia will make an ambitious contribution in the context of national efforts; However, 
results and actions to mitigate and adapt can increase if it has the provision of means of 
implementation through mechanisms of international cooperation in the framework of the 
Convention,  in  accordance  with  the  principles  and  provisions  of  the  Convention,  in 
particular Articles 4.4 and 4.7. 
 
Bolivia considers that the joint approach between mitigation and adaptation in the context 
of  overall  development  plans,  is  the  only  way  to  systematically  address  climate  change, 
including the links between the different social, economic and environmental dimensions. 
Bolivia raises the need to establish a mechanism for international cooperation to support 
the integral development and climate resilience and the start of implementation of a Joint 
Mitigation and Adaptation Mechanism for Integral and Sustainable Management of Forests 
to strengthen synergies between mitigation and adaptation climate change in the field of

forests.   
 
Comprehensive  structural  solutions  and  results  and  national  action  on  climate 
change 
 
To  contribute  in  solving  the  climate  crisis  based  on  the  alternative  vision  of  living  well, 
helping to implement proposals that allow the world to advance structural solutions to the 
climate crisis, Bolivia presents the following contribution in two dimensions: one linked to 
the  structural  solutions,  and  other  results  and  national  actions  within  the  framework  of 
holistic development.   
 
Structural solutions to the climate crisis   
1.  Adoption  of  a  new  model  of  civilization  in  the  world  without  consumerism, 
war-mongering, and mercantilism, a world without capitalism; build and consolidate a 
world  order  of  Living  Well  that  defends  and  promotes  the  integral  rights  of  our 
peoples, undertaking the path of harmony with nature and respect for life. 

2.  Construction of a climate system based on responsibility to Mother Earth, the culture 
of life and the full realization of humanity in their holistic development, humanizing 
the economy, surpassing the simplistic approach to decarbonization of the economy. 

3.  Protection of the Rights of Mother Earth in an articulated and complementary manner 

to the rights of peoples to their development.   

4.  Defense of universal common goods such as the seas and oceans, water, atmospheric 
space,  as  well  as  the  technological  monopoly,  promoting  people's  access  to  the 
common heritage. 

5.  Elimination of patents on technologies and recognition of the human right to science 

and technology of life. 

6.  Effective implementation by governments of the human right to water. 
7.  Establishment  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  Climate  and  Mother  Earth  to 
enable  countries  to  fulfill  their  international  commitments  to  climate  change  in  a 
context of respect for the rights of peoples and of Mother Earth. 

8.  Allocate  the  resources  of  the  military  machinery  of  the  imperial  powers  and  the 

war-mongers to finance the activities of the peoples against climate change. 

9.  Eradication  of  commodification  of  nature  and  carbon  markets  promoting  business 

climate millionaires, which do not solve the problem of the climate crisis. 

10. Decolonize natural resources environmental colonial biased views that see the peoples 
of the South as forest rangers of Northern countries and communities as enemies of 
nature. 

 
Results and national actions in the context of holistic development 
 
Bolivia  considers  its  nationally  determined  contributions  as  an  ambitious  and  just  effort, 
considering its national circumstances. Bolivia's contribution articulates in two periods in 
an integrated manner. The first is linked to the 2015-2020 period, in the understanding that 
all  countries  should  undertake  ambitious  efforts  now  in  order  to  achieve  ambitious 
reduction  in  increase  of  global  temperature.  The  second  is  related  to  the  2021-2030 
scenario. Also, both periods consider the additional results that could be achieved with the 
support  of  international  cooperation  and  the  financial  mechanism  of  the  UNFCCC, 
understanding cooperation as grant-based finance and technology transfer.

This  annex  contains  the  methodologies  used  to  calculate  the  results  of  the  Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution by the Plurinational State of Bolivia. 
 
Global emissions budget 
 
Bolivia has developed the Climate Justice Index to calculate the participation of countries in 
the distribution of CO2 budget fairly and with a climate justice criterion. For this purpose 
data  of 
the  ecological  footprint,  historical  responsibility,  development  capacity, 
technological capacity, and the population of the countries were used. 
 
The  following  calculation  for  the  these  variables  and  data  sources  are  used:  i)  for  the 
calculation of the ecological footprint, the Ecological Footprint Global Index used by the 
UN  Programme 
(CBD), 
corresponding to Footprint Network; ii) The historical responsibility is calculated based on 
CO2  emissions  since  1750,  distributed  according  to  IPCC  data  for  2010;  iii)  For  the 
calculation of development capacity, the following was used: i) Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) with World Bank data, ii) Poverty as a percentage of the population living on less 
than  $  us1,25  with  data  from  the  Statistical  Division  of  the  United  Nations,  and  iii)  the 
Human  Development  Index  (HDI)  developed  by  UNDP;  and  iv)  The  technological 
capability  used  the  Performance  Index  of  Industrial  Competition  by  UNIDO  and  R&D 
expenditure as a percentage of GDP based information from the World Bank. 
 
The  equation  developed  by  Bolivia  in  calculating  the  Climate  Justice  Index  comprises  the 
ecological  footprint 
(dj), 
technological capacity (tj) and population (pj) as detailed below:

(hj),  historical  responsibility 

(rj),  development  capacity 

 
The  indicator  of  percentage  distribution  of  the  carbon  budget  (ij)  is  obtained  by 
multiplying  each  variable  normalized  by  a  weight  θ∈R0,1  and  adding  the  result  to  the 
equation, where the signs of the parameters θ∈R0,1 reflect the direction the relationship 
between the variable and the percentage of budget.

This  graph  shows  the  percentage  distribution  of  the  countries  grouped  in  Annex  I  and 
non-Annex  I,  defined  in  the  context  of  the  UNFCCC,  resulting  from  the  application  of 
this methodology. The indicator percentage distribution of carbon budget is obtained by 
multiplying each variable standardized by a specific weight with a vision of climate justice 
that  gives  greater  relevance  to  the  historical  responsibility,  population  and  development 
capacity  when  calculating  the  percentage  distribution  of  CO2  budget  equivalent.  The 
calculations  reflect  the  direction  of  the  relationship  between  the  variables  and  the 
percentage  of  budget  (low  budget  to  greater  ecological  footprint,  greater  historical 
responsibility,  greater  development  capacity  and  /  or  technology,  and  higher  budget 
compared to a larger population). 
 
Water 
Bolivia has developed the Hydric Vulnerability Index based on the conceptual framework on 
vulnerability  of  the  Fourth  Report  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change 
(IPCC) in 2007. It establishes that vulnerability depends on the sensitivity and adaptation 
capacity of the system. Base on this:   
 
Hydric Vulnerability = Hazard + Sensitivity of Water System - Water Adaptability. 
 
This  index  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  comprehensive  effect  (external  and  internal), 
taking  into  account:  i)  intensity,  persistence  and  recurrence  of  the  threats  of  climate 
change, ii) sensitivity of living systems and communities that coexist in such systems and 
iii) ability to adapt to climate change, which in turn includes: catchment, reservoir, storage 
and provision of water for human consumption and irrigation, increased social community 
water  management,  improving  agricultural  production  with  more  efficient  irrigation 
systems, wastewater reuse in big cities, and the universal expansion of national coverage of 
drinking water. 
 
Bolivia  has  also  developed  the  Index  of  Adaptation  Capacity  in  Water,  which  was 

calculated  using  data  from  community  management  (𝑔𝑗),  productivity  (𝑦𝑗)  water  storage 
(𝑐𝑗), access to water (𝑎𝑗) and poverty (𝑝𝑗) between 2015 and 2030, through the following 
This index (𝑖𝑗) was obtained by multiplying each variable normalized weight θ∈ℝ ^ 0.1 

𝑖𝑗= 𝜃1𝑔𝑗+𝜃2𝑦𝑗+𝜃3𝑐𝑗+𝜃4𝑎𝑗−𝜃5𝑝𝑗 

equation: 
 

 

and  adding  the  result  to  the  equation,  so  that  an  increase  in  community  management, 
productivity, storage and access to water will increase the value of the indicator, reflecting

greater  resilience,  while  an  increase  in  poverty  will  reduce  the  value  of  the  indicator 
representing less adaptability. 
 
The  main  variables  analyzed  are  impacts  and  outcomes  with  respect  to  water,  and 
articulated  in  an  integrated  and  complementary  way,  the  same  as  shown  in  the  graph

Energy 
For  the  modelling  of  the  scenarios  in  the  electricity  sector,  as  well  as  the  calculation  of 
carbon  equivalent  emissions  (CO2e)  and  the  optimization  for  each  stage  of  electricity 
generation, the OSeMOSYS program (Open-Source Energy Modelling System), developed 
by the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (KTH)1. This program is an open source 
software  that  allows  modelling  and  optimization  the  planning  of  medium  and  long-term 
energy systems.

The graph above displays, in an integrated manner, the articulation of the most important 
different  variables  related  to  the  electricity  sector.  The  increase  in  electricity  power 
influences the increase in export earnings, which in turn promotes the growth of GDP and 
this  in  the  impact  of  reducing  electricity  NBI  through  electric  coverage  and  reducing 
moderate  and  extreme  poverty.  Also,  this  displays  the  CO2  /  energy  and  CO2  /  GDP 
ratio, with a significant decrease in the proportion of CO2 influence in the economy and in 
power  generation.  Overall,  this  process  contributes  in  reducing  emissions  from  the 
electricity sector. 
 
Forestry and agriculture and livestock 
 
Bolivia  has  developed  the  Sustainable  Life  of  Forest  Index  to  measure  the  combined 
capacity  to  mitigate  and  adapt  to  the  comprehensive  and  sustainable  management  of 
forests, agricultural and agroforestry production systems. 
 

Informal translation. For the authoritative version, please refer to the Spanish version published on the UNFCCC 
website.   
The index articulates environmental functions (𝑓!), poverty (𝑝!), community management 
(𝑔!),  production  (𝑦!),  and  forest  cover  (𝑐!),  between  2015  and  2030.  As  environmental 

functions are provided for the following: i) carbon capture and storage; ii) the presence of 
organic matter in the soil; iii) availability of water; and iv) the presence of biodiversity in 
areas with high conservation value. 
 
The equation designed by the Plurinational State of Bolivia to calculate the index Sustainable 
Live of Forest Index is: 
 

The Index (𝑖!) is obtained by multiplying each variable standardized by a weight 𝜃∈ℝ!,! 

𝑖!=𝜃!𝑓!−𝜃!𝑝!+𝜃!𝑔!+𝜃!𝑦!+𝜃!𝑐! 

and  adding  the  result  in  that  equation,  so  an  increase  in  environmental  functions, 
community management, production and higher net forest cover, will increase the value of 
the index of aggregate capacity to mitigate and adapt, while a rise in poverty will reduce the 
value of the index. 
 
The main variables analysed are results and impacts in relation to forests and agriculture 
and livestock articulate in an integrated and complementary way, as presented in the chart 
below.
