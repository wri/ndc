EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of the Republic of Djibouti is an extension of 
the country's commitments to fighting the effects of climate change. The process of drafting the INDC 
enabled a summary of all of the policies and programmes linked to climate change. It also provided an 
opportunity to reassess financing needs to fund the country's adaptation.  

As an LDC and a coastal country of the Horn of Africa, the country's vulnerability is considerably high. 
As  a  result,  this  contribution  reflects  both  the  country's  political  will  to  participate  in  the  worldwide 
reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the scope of its adaptation needs. 

The  Republic  of  Djibouti  has  committed  to  reducing  its  GHG  emissions  by  40%  by  the  year  2030, 
representing close to 2 Mt of CO2e, compared to projections for that  year according to the business-
as-usual scenario. This commitment is an ambitious one for a country like the Republic of Djibouti. It 
can  be  attained  through  a  combination  of  mitigation  measures  and  the  development  of  sustainable 
economic sectors like renewable energies.  

To fulfil that level of ambition, the Republic of Djibouti will need to invest more than US $3.8 billion, in 
collaboration  with  the  international  community.  An  additional  US  $1.6  billion,  conditional  on  new 
funding  sources  like  the  Green  Climate  Fund,  along  with  international  support,  would  enable  the 
country to reduce its emissions by a further 20% by 2030. The total effort, under both the unconditional 
and conditional scenarios, would essentially entail maintaining the country's emissions at roughly their 
level in 2010. 

In terms of adaptation, the Republic of Djibouti has undertaken numerous plans and programmes. The 
priority objectives are also linked to the country's social priorities: 

*  Reduction of vulnerability to drought; 

*  Protection against rising sea levels; 

* 

Improvement of access to water; 

*  Protection of biodiversity; 

*  Reinforcement of the resilience of rural populations. 

The  adaptation  projects  currently  being  implemented  account  for  a  budget  of  nearly  €100  million. 
However, that sum represents just 12% of the total amount that will need to be invested in adaptation 
under the 2°C Scenario, and a mere 7.5% in the case of the 4°C Scenario. 

These  figures  show  that  investing  in  adaptation  measures  is  a  crucial  issue  for  the  Republic  of 
Djibouti.  The  country  will  not be  able to raise the  necessary  funds  on  its  own.  With this  contribution, 
the  Republic  of  Djibouti  wants  to  reaffirm  its  belief  in  the  principle  of  common  but  differentiated 
responsibilities and to call on the international community to mobilise in response to this decisive issue 
for all of humanity. 
NATIONAL CONTEXT 

The Republic of Djibouti is located in the Horn of Africa, at the intersection of the Gulf of Aden and the 
Red  Sea.  The  country  has  a  semi-desert  tropical  climate  characterised  by  recurring  natural 
catastrophes  and  extended  periods  of  drought.  Its  arable  land,  natural  and  mineral  resources,  and 
water  resources  are  very  low  and  are  subject  to  strong  pressure  from  climate  change.  With  an 
estimated  per  capita  gross  national  product  (GNP)  of  US  $1,030  in  2014,  the  Republic  of  Djibouti  is 
one of the poorest countries in the world, and one of the most vulnerable to climate change. 

At COP19 in Warsaw, the Republic of Djibouti underscored the fact that climate change is a threat to 
the country's food security  and water resources, as  well  as to sustainable development. With its arid 
climate and low level of social development, the Republic of Djibouti is vulnerable to various climate-
related  effects,  including  extreme  drought,  extreme  temperatures,  rising  sea  levels,  flash  floods  and 
the salinization of soils and water. These phenomena have already been observed in the country and 
are  expected  to  increase  in  frequency  and  intensity  in  the  future,  according  to  the  various  climate 
scenarios.  

In the case of an optimistic climate scenario, the cost of the damage is likely to exceed US $5 billion. 
Implementing adaptation measures would make it possible to anticipate the effects of climate change. 
An  investment  of  close  to  US  $1  billion  would  enable  a  reduction  of  the  total  costs  of  the  impact  by 
two, account taken of residual damage.

The  Republic  of  Djibouti  has  thus  adopted  a proactive position  to handling  climate  change. It ratified 
the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  in  1995.  Pursuant  to  the 
provisions  of  Article  4  of  that  convention,  the  country  developed  a  second  national  communication, 
which  it  submitted  to  the  UNFCCC  in  2014.  Earlier,  in  2006,  the  country  had  already  identified  a 
number  of  priority  adaptation  and  resilience  actions  as  part  of  a  National  Adaptation  Programme  of 
Action encompassing activities in the agricultural, forestry, water, livestock and coastal sectors. 

To combine  the  country's  fight  against  the  effects  of  climate  change  with its  economic  development, 
the Republic of Djibouti is pursuing the objective of becoming a veritable economic crossroads and a 
showcase for sustainable development along the Red Sea. To achieve that aim, several political plans 
are  under  development,  including  national  strategies  for  a  green  economy,  for  biodiversity  and  on 
climate change.  

The  Republic  of  Djibouti  will  work  to  contribute  to  global  efforts  to  reduce  GHG  emissions.  This 
ambition  will  rely  on  the  development  of  renewable  energies  such  as  geothermal,  wind  and  solar 
power. But the country will need to focus its efforts on adaptation above all and seek out the support of 
the  international  community.  The  present  contribution  is  part  of  a  dynamic  process  and  may  be 
reassessed in line with changes in the national and international contexts. 
DJIBOUTI'S CONTRIBUTION TO MITIGATION 

Objective and expected directions for 2030 

General objectives 

By means of unconditional measures, the Republic of Djibouti is committed to preventing 1.8 Mt CO 2e 
of  future  GHG  emissions,  thus  reducing  its  emissions  by  40%  compared  to  the  business-as-usual 
scenario.  

The  implementation  of  conditional  measures  would  enable  a  further  reduction  in  CO2e  emissions  by 
0.9 Mt, or 20% of GHG emissions compared to the  business-as-usual scenario for 2030. In this way, 
the  conditional  mitigation  scenario  would  enable  the  Republic  of  Djibouti  to  maintain  its  volume  of 
emissions at a level equivalent to that of 2010. 

Business-as-usual scenario 

The  linear  sectoral  projection  was  used  to  estimate  the  GHG  emissions  level  in  2030  without  the 
implementation  of  any  mitigation  measures.  In  that  case,  2030  GHG  emissions  would  more  than 
double their level in 2010. Nearly 55% of those emissions come from the "Energy" category, making it 
a priority sector for the implementation of mitigation options by the Republic of Djibouti.

Assumptions and methodological approaches 

Model and methodology for estimating emissions 

The  business-as-usual  scenario  was  developed  using  the  GACMO  model  and  on  linear  sectoral 
projections.  It  is  based  on  the  2000  inventory  of  GHG  emissions,  produced  in  accordance  with  the 
1996 revised guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 

Gases covered 

The  contribution  of  the  Republic  of  Djibouti  is  based  on  estimated  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  methane 
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions across all economic sectors. Fluoride gas emissions were not 
counted, because they were deemed negligible at the national level. 

Geographic and sectoral scope 

The selected sectors were defined on the basis of the latest GHG inventory, as per the Revised 1996 
IPCC  Guidelines,  and  cover  the  entire  country.  In  view  of  the  uncertainty  in  respect  of  the  level  of 
carbon sequestration by forest land  and of emissions in uncultivated areas, the  "Land Use" category 
was not selected.  

List of selected categories and sub-categories:  

Energy  
 

Agriculture  
 

  Electricity imports 

  Consumption  of 

fossil 

fuels  by 

the 

industrial, 

residential, 

commercial, agricultural and transport sectors. 

  Enteric fermentation 

  Manure management 

  Agricultural soils 

Waste 

  Solid waste 

Industrial Processes 

  Cement production 

 

 
Baseline year and data  

2000 was taken as the baseline year. As a result, any mitigation measures implemented after that date 
are not included in the business-as-usual scenarios. 

The  data  were  extracted  from  the  latest  national  GHG  inventory,  published  in  2014.  Data  for  the 
"Energy" category were enhanced with more precise information collected by the Agence Djiboutienne 
pour la maîtrise de l'énergie (ADME) [Djibouti Energy Management Agency]. 

The  GWP  values  used  were  those  identified  by  the  IPCC  for  the  preparation  of  national  emissions 
inventories in accordance with UNFCCC Decision 17/CP.8. 

Strategy and planning  

General strategy and evolution of the legislative and regulatory framework 

The  Republic  of  Djibouti  is  preparing to launch  its  green economy  strategy,  the  aims  of which are  to 
encourage the  use of low  carbon technologies that are resilient to climate change, to promote green 
jobs,  and  to  take  advantage  of  climate  finance  to  raise  funds  nationally  and  internationally.  This 
strategy  will  be  developed  for  the  economy's  key  sectors,  in  line  with  the  long-term  vision  for  the 
country.  

In  parallel,  the  Republic  of  Djibouti  is  in  the  process  of  developing  a  national  strategy  on  climate 
change.  That  strategy  will  draw  on  both  the  National  Adaptation  Plan  (NAP)  and  the  National 
Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA),  adopted in  2006.  It  will  incorporate changes  in regulations 
relating to buildings, air conditioners and refrigerators.  

These two complementary strategies should enable the Republic of Djibouti to attain its 2030 targets 
as set out herein.

Equity and ambition of the contribution of the Republic of Djibouti 

On a global scale, the IPCC calculated the quantity of GHGs as more than 49,000 Mt of CO 2e in 2004. 
As  a  result,  the  annual  emissions  produced  by  the  Republic  of  Djibouti,  estimated  at  close  to  2  Mt 
CO2e in 2010, represent less than 0.005% of the global volume. In other words, its emissions are non-
significant  compared  with  worldwide  emissions.  Nonetheless,  the  Republic  of  Djibouti  has  prepared 
this contribution to reaffirm its belief in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and to 
take unprecedented measures in response to this issue. 

As an LDC, it is vital for the Republic of Djibouti to reduce its emissions without significantly affecting 
the  country's  economic  and  social  development.  This  contribution  guarantees  an  equitable 
commitment. In the case of the unconditional scenario, the level of GHG per GDP point will decrease 
from  2.5  in  2000  to  0.8  in  2030.  In  addition,  the  planned  mitigation  measures  will  support  priority 
economic  sectors  like  renewable  energies  and  energy  efficiency.  On  its  own  scale,  the  Republic  of 
Djibouti is making significant contributions to reducing global emissions.  

The planned unconditional level of emissions reductions, planned under the unconditional scenario, is 
40%  compared  to  the  business-as-usual  scenario  for  2030.  This  ambitious  commitment  will  support 
other country's commitments so as to make a collective contribution to the global objective of limiting 
the  global  temperature  rise  to  2°C.  For  the  Republic  of  Djibouti,  upholding  this  objective  will  be 
essential,  given  the  country's  heavy  exposure  to  the  impact  of  climate  change.  Adaptation  and 
increased resilience will remain the priority for the country.   
DJIBOUTI'S CONTRIBUTION TO ADAPTATION 

Objectives, national priorities and long-term vision 

In  recent  years,  climate  change  has  already  appeared  in  the  form  of  increases  in  average  global 
temperature and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like drought and flooding of 
oueds. For example, the minimum temperature recorded in Djibouti City has risen by close to 1.3°C in 
the  space  of  30  years.  In  addition,  the  geographical  location  of  the  Republic  of  Djibouti  makes  it 
directly  vulnerable  to  the  rising  sea  level,  especially  given  that  88%  of  its  population  lives  along  the 
coastline. 

These difficult conditions cause serious problems in terms of the availability of a sufficient quantity and 
quality  of  water  resources,  be  it  for  the  country's  human  population,  livestock  or  agriculture.  The 
aquifer's resources are no longer enough to meet the country's multiple needs.  

The  Republic  of  Djibouti  also  boasts  relatively  significant  land-based  biodiversity  (mangroves,  Day 
Forest and endemic species). However, it is stricken by the ongoing shrinkage of its arable land and 
its  biodiversity  due  to  rapid  desertification,  which  will  only  be  exacerbated  with  rising  temperatures. 
Likewise, in respect of marine ecosystems, more than half the coral cover is likely to disappear in the 
years to come.  

This deterioration could have a profound effect on the local populations that are dependent on those 
resources  and  who  already  live  in  poverty.  The  various  impacts  of  climate  change  engender  major 
financial  and  human  losses,  primarily  in  the  nation's  capital  but  also  in  the  rest  of  the  country.  As  a 
result, national adaptation priorities have been defined for 2035, broken down into multiple strategies. 
Concerning adaptation, this will entail:  

  Reducing vulnerability to drought; 
  Protecting against rising sea levels; 
 
  Protecting biodiversity; 
  Reinforcing the resilience of rural populations. 

Improving access to water;

Development of agro-
pastoral perimeters as a 
strategy for Djibouti's 
poor rural communities' 
adaptation to climate 
change 

The  project's  objective  is  to  diversify  and  bolster  resilience  to  climate 
change  among  the  agro-pastoral  practices  used  in  the  rural  regions  of 
Djibouti. It is based on three components:  

  Long-term,  guaranteed  access  to  water  resources  within  a 

context of climate change; 

  Shaded  agro-pastoral  perimeters  to  support  and  diversify  the 

climate resilience of agro-pastoral systems; 

  Secure access to funding for climate resilience, in the interest of 

the development of agro-pastoral companies.

Strategic Individual 
Sanitation Plan for the 
Dikhil Region 

This  Strategic  Individual  Sanitation  Plan  aims  to  identify  improved, 
sustainable  sanitation  solutions  for  populations  without  access  to  a 
collective sanitation service (sewer system) in: 

  Rural  settings 

that  are  scattered,  often  nomadic,  or 

just 

beginning to settle down; 

  The district administrative centres of Ali Sabieh, Dikhil, Arta-Wea, 

Tadjourah and Obock; 

  The  peripheral  neighbourhoods  of  Djibouti,  particularly  those  to 

the west of Ambouli Oued.

This  project,  steered  by  the  Secretary  of  State  in  charge  of  National 
Solidarity and the ADDS (Djibouti Social Development Agency), provides 
solar  electricity  to  rural  areas  as  an  instrument  for  poverty  reduction. 
Various  mechanisms  have  been  rolled  out  in  Djibouti  City  and  in  the 
countryside,  including  personal  kits,  street  lights,  a  mini  power  plant, 
drinking water supply and solar-powered light bulbs. 

Funding: Republic of Djibouti. 

The project's objective is to set up climate change adaptation measures 
to  protect  and  enhance  the  resilience  of  the  local  communities  and  the 
ecosystems in the Tadjourah and Hanlé Regions. 

  Component 1: Protection against water-related climate change; 

  Component 2: Rehabilitation of ecosystems (plant cover in Hanlé 
the  coastal  zone  of

  Component 3: Sustainable, resistant means of subsistence;  

  Component  4:  Incorporation  of  adaptation  to  climate  change  as 

part of the development and resilience of the communities. 

Funding: UNEP. 

The  funds  allocated  under  the  11th  European  Development  Fund  (EDF) 
will target the following sectors:  

(a)  Water and sanitation; 
(b)  Food security.  

The  actions  planned  for  those  two  sectors  will  aim  for  the  equitable 
development  of  the  country's  rural  and  underprivileged  areas,  with  an 
emphasis on strengthening the resilience of vulnerable populations. 
The proposed actions will be subject to climate change impact reduction 
requirements,  dictated  by  strict  environmental  criteria.  As  the  country 
contains  a number  of  already  weakened  ecosystems,  any  work  done  to 
improve  food  security  and  water  resources  management  will  need  to 
endeavour 
to  preserve

Adaptation measures pending funding 

Creation of a second 

The  creation  of  a  single  desalination  plant  will  not  suffice  to  meet  the 
desalination plant 
 

population's drinking water needs, which totalled some 593 million m3 in 
2011.  As  a  result,  the  rapid  launch  of  the  construction  of  a  second 
desalination plant could be envisaged. 

Repairs to water mains 
 

Water  loss  within  the  water  supply  network  is  estimated  at  more  than 
30%.  This  is  a  considerable  loss,  further  aggravating  water  shortages. 
Bringing  the  mains  up  to  standard  therefore  appears  to  be  a  vital  step. 
Such an investment has not yet been costed, however. 

Construction of new 
dykes 
 

Construction project for 
a dam in the Ambouli 
watershed 

The safety of the coastal zone is crucial to Djibouti's development. Faced 
with rising sea levels, many cities that are vulnerable to this threat, such 
as  New  York  and  the  majority  of  Dutch  cities,  have  already  prepared 
dyke  construction  investment  plans.  This  solution  has  not  yet  been 
studied for Djibouti, but it could certainly be considered. For informational 
purposes,  the  plans  launched  by  the  Netherlands  amount  to  a  total  of 
more than €20 billion, for exposure similar to that of Djibouti. 

Djibouti  City,  the  national  capital,  is  regularly  threatened  by  devastating 
floods  from  the  Ambouli  watershed,  with  the  loss  of  human  life  and 
serious material and economic damage. 
The  construction  of  a  dam  in  that  watershed  could  considerably  reduce 
the  effects  of  flooding  and  could  also  serve  to  restock  the  groundwater 
that supplies the capital. 

 

 
IMPLEMENTATION METHODS  

Capacity-building 

Given  the  weakness  of  its  economic  and  financial  capacities  and  the  scale  of  its  funding  needs  for 
poverty  reduction,  environmental  management  and  sustainable  development,  Djibouti  is  one  of  the 
potential  beneficiaries  of  this  initiative. To be  able to  seize that opportunity,  the  country  set  itself  the 
objective  of  developing  a  National  Strategy  for  a  Green  Economy,  which  will  enable  it  to  better 
incorporate  climate  finance  into  its  development,  as  well  as  a  national  strategy  for  preserving 
biodiversity  and  another  on  climate  change  in  order  to  boost  its  resilience  in  respect  of  the  harmful 
effects of climate change, whilst contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  

Need for technology transfers 
The  majority  of  the  options  presented  above,  such  as  the  construction  of  a  geothermal,  wind  or 
photovoltaic  power  plant,  will  necessitate  major  technological  transfers.  It  is  therefore  crucial  for  the 
Republic  of  Djibouti  to  establish  long-term  partnerships  with  university  centres  or  private  companies 
capable  of  supplying  those  technologies.  At  present,  an  important  partnership  with  the  German 
Cooperation  is  providing  Djibouti  with  technical  and  financial  support  for  the  promotion  of  renewable 
energies. 

Funding needs 

In a 6% growth scenario, the investment required to maintain an emissions level similar to that of 2010 
(conditional  scenario)  is  more  than  US  $5.5  billion.  The  unconditional  scenario,  which  is  already 
financed,  either  by  means  of  the  national  budget  or  through  the  support  of  the  international 
community, represents approximately 70% of that amount.  

For the measures forming the conditional scenario, whose cost is estimated at US $1.65 billion, it has 
yet  to  be  determined  the  proportion  of  that  investment  that  could  be  covered  domestically.  The 
national  strategy  for  energy  procurement  and  management,  currently  under  development,  should 
provide  better  visibility  on  this  point.  Nonetheless,  considering  the  level  of  investment  required,  it  is 
very  likely  that  Djibouti  will  need  to  access  international  funding  to  cover  a  large  proportion  of  that 
investment. 

The adaptation projects currently being implemented account for a budget of nearly €100 million. That 
sum represents just 12% of the total amount that will need to be invested in adaptation under the 2°C 
Scenario, and a mere 7.5% in the case of the 4°C Scenario. 

These  figures  show  that  investing  in  adaptation  measures  is  a  crucial  issue  for  the  Republic  of 
Djibouti.  The  country  will  not  be  able  to  raise  the  necessary  funds  on  its  own.  As  a  result,  the 
mobilization of the international community will be vital. 

Details of the implementation methods are provided in a dedicated document entitled "Guide de mise 
en œuvre pour la Contribution Prévue Déterminée Nationale" ("Implementation Guide for the Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution").
