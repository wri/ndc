Iceland's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Iceland is committed to the UNFCCC negotiation process towards adopting a protocol, another legal 
instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention, applicable to all Parties, in 
line with the objective of keeping global warming below 2°C.  
 
 
Iceland‘s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
 
Iceland aims to be part of a collective delivery by European countries to reach a target of 40% 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. A precise commitment for 
Iceland within such collective delivery has yet to be determined, and is dependent on an agreement 
with the European Union and its Member States and possibly other countries. Under such an 
arrangement, Iceland will ensure fullfillment of its fair share of the collective delivery of the 40% 
target by: a) continuing participation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and b) determining a target 
for emissions outside the EU-ETS by the same methodology as applied to EU Member States. In the 
event that an agreement on collective delivery is not reached, Iceland will determine a national 
target by other methods and communicate it to the UNFCCC.  
 
In constructing a target for Iceland that can be seen as fair in an international comparison and 
contributing to a global goal, Iceland considers it to be most transparent to set a target based on 
common methods applied in the European Union and the European Economic Area. Almost half of 
Iceland‘s emissions is currently regulated by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and Iceland will 
continue to be part of the EU-ETS after 2020 due to its commitments under the Agreement on the 
European Economic Area. Iceland also uses a comparable method to the EU to determine a target for 
non-ETS emissions, as specified in an agreement between Iceland and the EU and its Member States 
on joint fulfilment of commitments under the Kyoto Protocol during the second commitment period. 
Iceland foresees that a post-2030 target for Iceland will be constructed in a similar fashion, based on 
the current arrangement. In the event that an agreement is not reached, Iceland will determine its 
INDC in another manner and communicate it to the UNFCCC, but it should be noted that Iceland‘s 
participation in a common European market in emissions credits under the EU-ETS complicates the 
determination of a simple economy-wide target for Iceland, as credits under the EU-ETS are traded 
freely in a common market, with limited influence by Icelandic authorities.

Iceland has a national implementation plan for climate mitigation in 
place, aimed at ensuring Iceland's compliance with commitments in 
the Kyoto Protocol until 2020. Iceland takes part in the EU Emissions 
Trading Scheme, as part of the European Economic Area; this 
participation is seen as continuing after 2020, regulating over 40% 
of Iceland's emissions.

Iceland intends to include LULUCF in its post-2020 contribution to 
climate mitigation, in accordance with established and accepted 
methodology for LULUCF accounting. In particular Iceland intends to 
employ afforestation and revegetation to contribute to its goals. 
Iceland will also use wetland restoration as part of its climate 
efforts, and possibly other LULUCF activities.  Accounting for the 
land sector will be decided upon later, with reference to established 
methodology and based on the progress made internationally 
towards a common framework for land sector accounting.  
 
Iceland will take part in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme after 
2020, which currently regulates approximately 40% of Iceland's 
emissions. Iceland will possibly take part in other European markets 
for emissions credits, as part of its intention to take part in collective 
delivery of post-2020 climate mitigation goals, but mitigation efforts 
are seen as coming primarily through domestic efforts.  
By taking part in collective delivery of a 2030 target of -40%, and by 
applying common or comparable rules that apply to the European 
Union and its Member States and possibly more European 
countries, Iceland considers its intended contribution to be 
ambitious and fair and transparent as far as effort is concerned.  

 
 
Additional clarifications on emissions from Iceland 
 
In determining Iceland‘s efforts for climate mitigation, and assessing their ambition level and 
fairness, it is useful to look at Iceland‘s circumstances regarding size and the proportional impact of 
relatively large single projects, the high percentage of renewable energy, and Iceland‘s high level of 
integration into European carbon markets, notably through participation in the EU-ETS and Iceland‘s 
participation in joint commitment under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. 
These factors are briefly explained here below. 
 
Iceland‘s electricity production and heating comes almost 100% from renewable energy, with 
minimal emissions. This was mostly achieved before 1990. This means that Iceland must look to 
other sectors for mitigation options, including transport, agriculture, fisheries, industrial processes, 
waste and LULUCF. Iceland considers the utilization of its renewable energy sources to have global 
benefits from a climate change mitigation perspective. 
 

Iceland is a party to the EU-ETS, due to membership of the European Economic Area, and over 40% 
of Iceland‘s emissions fall under the trading scheme. It is foreseen that this will continue after 2020. 
For a small economy like Iceland access to markets is important, as it provides flexibility that bigger 
economies do not need to the same extent; a single project can contribute a high percentage of 
emissions in a small economy like Iceland‘s but hardly register in bigger economies.
