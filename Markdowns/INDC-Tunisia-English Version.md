Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Tunisia - 2015 

Introduction 

This  document  summarizes  the  intended  nationally  determined  contributions  (INDC)  of  Tunisia  for 
the  purposes  of  its  submission  to  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  United  Nations  Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The report has been drawn up in accordance with decision 
1/CP.20  (Lima  call  for  climate  action),  which  specifically  draws  attention,  in  paragraph  14,  to  the 
clarity,  transparency  and  understanding  of the INDC reports. It is based on important models and 
calculations of emissions reductions in various sectors, as well as ways of identifying and evaluating 
adaptation measures. 
The  document  was  drafted  through  broad cooperation  between the main  stakeholders  involved  in 
the  topic  of  climate  change  in  Tunisia,  including  public  institutions,  the  private  sector  and  civil 
society. Tunisia's contributions were also by and large developed on the basis of existing sectoral and 
horizontal  strategies,  such  as  the  national  climate  change  strategy,  drawn  up  in  2012;  the  energy 
efficiency  strategy; the  Tunisian  Solar Plan  and  the  adaptation  strategies  of  a range  of  sectors  and 
fields (coast, agriculture, water resources, health, tourism, and so on). 
In its contribution, Tunisia proposes reducing its greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors (energy; 
industrial  processes;  agriculture,  forestry  and  other  land  use;  waste)  in  order  to  lower  its  carbon 
intensity by 41 per cent in 2030, relative to the base year 2010. Mitigation efforts will particularly 
centre  on  the  energy  sector,  which  alone  accounts  for  75  per  cent  of  the  emissions  reductions 
contributing to this decrease in carbon intensity. As part of the energy transition policy advocated by 
the State, it is estimated that the energy sector will reduce its carbon intensity in 2030 by 46 per cent 
compared with 2010. 
Tunisia,  which  has  already  made  significant  strides  towards  mitigation  in  its  baseline,  is  looking  to 
reduce its carbon intensity unconditionally and through its own efforts by 13 per cent compared to 
2010,  i.e.  by  around  1/3  of  its  INDC.  To  achieve  the  rest  of  its  objective,  i.e.  an  additional  drop  in 
carbon intensity of 28 per cent  in 2030 compared to 2010, Tunisia is relying on the support of the 
international community for funding, capacity building and technology transfer. 
The  reduction  in  emissions  compared to the  baseline  scenario  would  be  in  the  order  of 26  million 
tCO2eq in 2030, and 207 million tCO2eq for the period 2015-2030. 
Implementation  of  the  Tunisian  contribution  towards  mitigation  requires  substantial  funds  to  be 
mobilized  -  an  estimated  18  billion  US  dollars  -  to  cover  investment  needs  and  finance  capacity 
building programmes. 
The national effort required to achieve Tunisia's unconditional contribution is estimated at nearly 10 
per cent of the total mitigation investment needs. The national effort exclusively concerns the energy 
sector, which accounts for the most significant part of the investment needs. 
In  terms  of  adaptation,  Tunisia  remains  very  vulnerable  to  the  global  warming  anticipated  in  the 
region and the corresponding implications of major increases in temperature, reduced precipitation 
and  rising  sea  levels.  The  socio-economic  and  environmental  impact  will  particularly  affect  water 
resources, agriculture, natural and artificial ecosystems, the coastline, health and tourism.  
The additional costs of the necessary adaptation measures for these sectors and fields will come to 
some 2 billion dollars and should be borne completely by the international community as part of the 
global fight against climate change.  
Altogether, the total additional financing required for mitigation and adaptation would be around 20 
billion US dollars to fund investment requirements and capacity building.  

1  National situation 

Tunisia  is  situated  in  North  Africa,  covering  an  area  of  some  164,000  km²  and  with  a  1,300  km 
coastline on the Mediterranean Sea. The climate is particularly arid and variable, with precipitation 
ranging from 800 mm per year in the north to 150 mm per year in the south.

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Tunisia - 2015 

The population growth rate has steadily been dropping, reaching 1 per cent per year during the past 
decade. Tunisia had some 11 million inhabitants in 2014, whereas it had 9.9 million in 2004. 
Tunisia  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  countries  most  exposed  to  climate  change  in  the 
Mediterranean.  The  main  risks  which  it  is  likely  to  confront  are  temperature  increases,  reduced 
precipitation,  rising  sea  levels  and  escalating  extreme  weather  phenomena  (floods  and  droughts). 
These risks are likely to result in major environmental and socio-economic vulnerability.  
Tunisia is aware of these challenges and has adopted a proactive policy of fighting climate change, 
both in terms of mitigation and adaptation. 
Moreover,  as  Tunisia  actively  supports  international  efforts  to  combat  climate  change,  it  has 
delivered on all of its commitments to the UNFCCC, the last of which was the submission of the first 
biennial report in December 2014.  
In addition, in the wake of the political changes triggered in December 2010, Tunisia adopted a new 
constitution on 26 January 2014, which incorporated the fight against climate change as a permanent 
feature.  Under  Article  44  of  the  new  constitution,  the  State  shall  "provide  the  means  necessary  to 
guarantee a healthy and balanced environment and contribute to the climate's integrity". 
The  policy  of  fighting  climate  change  is  particularly emphasized  in the  energy  sector.  It  is  the  case 
that, despite Tunisia's efforts to manage its energy over the past three decades, the energy system is 
today facing significant challenges: 
- 

Energy supply security issues due to the growing energy balance deficit and the heavy reliance on 
conventional energy; 
Economic  sustainability  issues  associated  with  fluctuations  in  global  energy  prices  and  their 
implications regarding the balance of payments and public finances. 

- 

To meet these challenges, the Tunisian authorities have decided, since 2013, to forge ahead with an 
energy  transition  process  based  on  an  unprecedented  strengthening  of  the  energy  management 
agenda and its two pillars of energy efficiency and renewable energies. This transition agenda aims 
for a reduction in primary energy demand of 30 per cent by 2030 compared to the baseline scenario, 
and a penetration rate of 30 per cent for renewable energies in electricity production.

Overall INDC 
objective  

 

The aim of Tunisia's contribution in the area of mitigation is to reduce its carbon 
intensity  by  41  per cent  compared to 2010. Carbon intensity is calculated as the 
relationship between the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in 
tons of CO2 equivalent) and the GDP, with 2005 set as a continuous baseline. 

Unconditional 
and conditional 
mitigation 
objectives  

In the specific sector of energy, Tunisia aims to reduce its carbon intensity by 46 
per cent compared to 2010 levels. 

Tunisia's  unconditional  contribution  corresponds  to  a  13  per  cent  reduction  in 
carbon  intensity,  with  2010  as  the  base  year,  or  around  1/3  of  the  overall 
objective.  

The  conditional  contribution  allows  for  an  additional  decrease  of  28  per  cent  in 
carbon intensity, with 2010 as the base year. 

The  graph  below  represents  the  trajectory  of  Tunisia's  conditional  and 
unconditional contribution for the period 2015-2030:

Equity and 
ambition 

Tunisia,  as  a  Non-Annex  I  Party  to  the  UNFCCC,  shall  actively  contribute  to  the 
planetary  effort  to  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Tunisia  considers  its 
contribution to be fair and ambitious on three fundamental grounds: 

 

-  Through  its  total  contribution  (both  unconditional  and  conditional),  Tunisia 
aims  to  reduce  its  carbon  intensity  by  41  per  cent  compared  to  2010.  The 
national  effort  (equivalent  to  the  unconditional  contribution)  would  lead  to  a 
reduction  of  13  per  cent  of  the  carbon  intensity  by  2030  compared  to  2010 
levels, i.e. almost 1/3 of the objective. 

 

Page 5 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Tunisia - 2015 

-  Tunisia  is  committed  to  reducing  its  carbon  intensity  to  below  2010  levels, 

although it contributed to only 0.07 per cent of global emissions in 2010. 

-  Thanks  to  its  overall  contribution,  by  2030,  emissions  per  capita  would  reach 
3.4 tCO2eq per capita, whereas global emissions in 2010 had already reached 7 
tCO2eq per capita.

2.3  Funding needs for mitigation 

Investment needs  

The  mitigation objective  would  require a  large  total  investment  amount 
to  be  mobilized  -  around  17.5  billion  US  dollars  over  the  period  2015-
2030 - distributed among the following sectors:

Around 85 per cent of the funding needs would have to be mobilized for 
the energy sector: 40 per cent  for energy efficiency and 45 per cent  for 
renewable energies.  

The capacity-building measures required to facilitate achievement of the 
INDC  objective  include,  inter  alia,  training  stakeholders,  institutional 
development,  technical  assistance  for  sectoral  mitigation  programmes 
and support for R&D and innovation.  

The  total  cost  of  covering  capacity-building  needs  is  estimated  at  about 
523 million US dollars for the period 2015-2030, the majority of which will 
be earmarked for the energy sector (about 450 million US dollars). 

In  addition,  technology  transfer  programmes  will  be  required  to  allow 
Tunisia to gain access  to know-how  and appropriate industrial means in 
order to ensure the sustainability of its contribution. These transfers may

The national effort and 
support from international 
financing  

take the form, for example, of industrial partnerships with parties holding 
the technologies. The Conference of the Parties to the Convention should 
also  develop  appropriate  mechanisms  to  facilitate  these  transfers, 
depending on the specific needs for each mitigation measure adopted. 

  The  national  effort  required  to  achieve  Tunisia's  unconditional 
contribution  is  estimated  at  around  10  per  cent  of  the  total 
mitigation investment needs. The national effort exclusively concerns 
the energy sector, which accounts for the most significant part of the 
mitigation objective.  

  International support should focus on funding the various remaining 
types  of  investment  needs  (concessional  lines  of  credit,  donations, 
direct investment, integration into carbon markets, etc.). 

In  the  energy  sector,  some  of  the  international  financial  support 
should  serve  to  bolster  the  Energy  Transition  Fund  (FTE). 1 This  fund 
was established by the Tunisian State in 2014 as a central instrument 
for implementing its energy transition agenda.  

Finally,  the  international  effort  will  also  focus  on  the  funding  of 
capacity building and technology transfer programmes. 

Usage of carbon market 
mechanisms  

To support the financing needs of its mitigation objective, Tunisia would 
like to use carbon market mechanisms in addition to the direct financial 
supports listed above, particularly for the following programmes: 

Tunisian Solar Plan 

- 
-  Mitigation in the cement industry and in any other sector which 

tends to be involved in carbon markets  
Energy efficiency and renewable energies in the building sector

2.4  Planning process 

INDC preparation  

INDC 
implementation  

The preparatory phases for the INDC were already under way in July 2014 with 
the  launch  of  a  series  of  consultation  workshops  bringing  together  the  main 
stakeholders involved in the climate change process (public administration, civil 
society, private sector and industry experts). 

This  process  has  gathered  momentum  since  publication  of  the  Lima  COP20 
decisions  defining  the  rules  for  achieving  the  INDCs  and  for  their  content.  The 
consultation process continued until validation. 

In  its  standard  development  agenda,  Tunisia  is  already  striving  to  mitigate  its 
greenhouse gas emissions in all of the key sectors which generate them: (i) The 
country  has  continuously  pursued  a  proactive  energy  management  policy  for 
some 30 years and has one of the lowest energy intensities in the Middle East/ 
North  Africa  region,  (ii)  It  has  achieved  major  accomplishments 
in  the 
reforestation  and  preservation of  forested  ecosystems, which  are  confirmed by 
the  finding  in  the  2010  greenhouse  gas  inventory  that  the  entire  Agriculture, 
forestry  and  other  land  use  (AFOLU)  sector  is  a  net  CO2  absorber,  (iii)  It  has 

                                                           

1 The Energy Transition Fund replaces the National Energy Management Fund (FNME), increasing its resources 
through  a  tax  on  energy  consumption,  diversifying  its  intervention  strategies  and  extending  the  range  of 
eligible actions.

always set store by improvement of agricultural productivity(including livestock) 
and  optimization  of  the  use  of  inputs,  (iv)  It  has  established  the  systematic 
introduction  of  controlled  landfills  and  has,  since  2006,  launched  Ministry  of 
Sustainable  Development  projects  for  degasification  and  gas  flaring  across  the 
country's eight main landfills. 

Tunisia was one of the pioneering countries in the drafting of several nationally 
appropriate mitigation  actions  (NAMAs)2,  thereby  standing  ready  to  sign  a  new 
climate agreement, and was one of the first non-Annex I countries to submit its 
first biennial report (31 December 2014).  

These  numerous  initiatives  prove  Tunisia's  determination  to  advance  swiftly 
beyond  the  already  proactive  baseline  which  it  has  adopted  for  a  number  of 
years  and  to  set  out  on  a  virtuous  and  ambitious  path  towards  mitigating  its 
emissions of greenhouse gases, drawing both on its own resources and on those 
of the international community.  

As part of its contribution to tackling climate change issues, Tunisia will step up 
its efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in several sectors: 

The energy sector: The aim of the mitigation plan is to intensify the promotion of 
energy  efficiency  in  all  consumer  sectors  and  for  all  energy  usages.  Around  20 
energy  efficiency  actions  have  been  included  in  the  calculation  of  avoidable 
emissions,  covering  the  entire  industrial,  building,  transport  and  agricultural 
sectors. This should allow primary energy demand to decrease by some 30 per 
cent by 2030 ,compared to the baseline. 

The  plan  also  advocates  increasing  the  use  of  renewable  energies,  not  least 
through  the  Tunisian  Solar  Plan  (PST).  This  will  raise  the  share  of  renewable 
energies  in  electricity  production  to 14 per cent in 2020 and to  30  per  cent  in 
2030, whereas it stood at only 4 per cent in 2015.  

To  achieve  this,  the  plan  will  aim  to  achieve  an  installed  renewable  energy 
capacity of 3,815 MW in 2030, including 1,755 MW for wind power, 1,610 MW 
for solar photovoltaic (PV) and 450 MW for concentrated solar power (CSP).  

With  regard  to  solar  heating,  Tunisia  intends  to  triple  the  solar  water  heater 
distribution rate, which will exceed 220 m² of collectors per 1,000 inhabitants in 
2030, compared to 73 in 2015. 

Industrial  processes  sector:  The  mitigation  plan  includes  the  use  of  a  NAMA  in 
the  cement  industry  from  2016  onwards  and  access  of  this  sector  to  carbon 
markets from 2021 onwards. 
Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Changes  in  Land  Use:  The  mitigation  plan  aims  to 
intensify the CO2 absorption capacities of forestry and arboriculture by stepping 
up  reforestation  and  by  consolidating  and  increasing  carbon  reserves  in  forest 
and  pastoral  environments.  The  carbon  footprint  for  agriculture  will  also  be 
improved  by  using  practices  that  generate  fewer  emissions,  such  as  optimizing 
the diets of domestic animals, promoting biological agriculture or conservation-
oriented agricultural practices, or recovering energy from animal waste. 
Waste:  The  mitigation  plan  provides  for  the  implementation,  from  2016,  of  a 
plan  to  install  facilities  to  transform  solid  waste  into  RDF  (refuse  derived  fuel) 

                                                           

2 Five NAMA proposals have already been developed: (i) NAMA Cement, (ii) NAMA Buildings (iii) NAMA Electricity Sector, 
(iv) NAMA Forests, and (v) NAMA Sanitation.

introducing 
intended  for  cement  facilities,  as  well  as  a  programme  for 
degasification  systems  in  controlled  landfills.  It  is  planned  to  recover  electricity 
from captured gases, at least at the main landfills. This energy option is covered 
in the low-carbon scenario for the energy sector. 
The  mitigation  plan  in  the  sanitation  sector  provides  in  particular  for  the 
installation  of  solar  PV  capacity  at  water  treatment  plants  (STEPs),  biogas 
digesters  for  electricity  production  and  a  reduction  in  the  chemical  oxygen 
demand (COD) of industrial wastewater. 

To  ensure  the  success  and  efficiency  of  the  actions  which  make  up  its 
contribution,  Tunisia  will  establish  a  rigorous  system  for  monitoring  and 
evaluating  the  actions  and  results  achieved.3 This  system  will  also  enable  the 
actions to be adjusted and potentially redirected. 
This  system  will  be  based  on  a  comprehensive  approach  of  Measurement, 
Notification and Verification (MRV)4 and will apply to all elements of the national 
strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The Tunisian MRV system will 
revolve around three major elements of greenhouse gas emissions, namely: 
-  MRV of greenhouse gas national emissions, which will be responsible for the 
preparation  each  year  of  inventory  data  for  greenhouse  gases  and  for 
distributing and checking this data.  

-  MRV  of  mitigation  measures,  which  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring, 
notifying  and  checking  the  impacts  (emission  reductions,  carbon  intensity, 
co-beneficiaries, etc.) of all mitigation measures, especially those developed 
under NAMA, in accordance with national and international regulations. 

-  MRV  of  support,  which  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring,  notifying  and 
checking  greenhouse  gas  emission  mitigation  support  and  adaptation 
actions  for  which  support  has  been  received  (funding,  technology  transfer 
and capacity building).

  N2O = 298 

The approaches for calculating greenhouse gas emissions derive directly from 
the  2006  IPCC  guidelines.  The  emissions  calculation  is  based  on  estimated 
activity data, which is deduced from a simulation model using the following 
approaches: 
  Energy  sector:  Emissions  are  assessed  in  the  baseline  scenario,  mainly 
using a bottom-up approach based on modelling the final energy demand 
by sector and by type of energy using the MEDPRO prediction model. This 
then  allows  primary  energy  demand  to  be  predicted  per  energy type  on 
the  basis  of  hypothetical  parameter  changes  in  the  electricity  sector 
(specific consumption, losses and mix).

The  baseline  scenario  already  includes  a  mitigation  component  since  it 
corresponds  to  an  average  decrease  in  primary  energy  intensity  in  the 
order of 1 per cent per year for the period 2010-2030.  
The  baseline  emissions  are  being  evaluated,  year  by  year,  from  2010  to 
2030, by applying the sectoral approach of the 2006 IPCC guidelines very 
carefully  (activity  data  and  emission  factors  by  sector  and  by  energy 
product). This sectoral approach covers CO2, CH4 and N2O. Annual baseline 
emissions  are  then  expressed  in  tons  of  CO2  equivalent.  This  approach 
should  make  it  easier  to  cross-check  the  results  of  this  baseline  against 
future  greenhouse  gas  inventories  which  will  be  carried  out  under  the 
MRV system in Tunisia. 
The  following  graph  shows  the  breakdown  of  the  energy  baseline  by 
sector:

Breakdown of the energy baseline by sector 

 

  Industrial  processes:  Emissions  assessments  for  the  baseline  scenario 
mainly  draw  on  the  results  of  the  cement  sector  NAMA.5 For  other 
process sources, the simulations are based either on the relationship with 
GDP or on the principle of a fixed production value.6 

  Forestry  and  other  land  use:  The  baseline  assumes  continuation  of  the 
reforestation  trend  and  conservation  measures  typically  pursued  by  the 
Directorate-General  for  Forestry,  as  well  as  the  same  rate  of  progress  in 
arboriculture. This trend scenario will therefore consolidate the status of 
this source of emissions/absorptions as a net absorber. 

  Agriculture: The baseline assumes that current trends in given agricultural 
practices will continue, while including four mitigation actions depending 
on  the  current  or  planned  rate  (including  poultry  dung  in  composting 
processes, biological agriculture, stepping up the role of legumes in arable 
crops and optimizing the use of synthetic mineral fertilizers).  

  Waste: 

Solid  waste:  The  baseline  assumes  that  current  waste  management 
practices will continue, with waste being buried in controlled landfills. The

Mitigation scenario 

baseline  incorporates  the  emission  reductions  of  the  two  Ministry  of 
Sustainable Development degasification projects.7 
Waste  water  treatment:  The  baseline  assumes  that  current  sanitation 
practices  will  continue  until  2030,  but  with  particular  efforts  made 
towards energy efficiency. 

  Energy  sector:  The  mitigation  scenario  is  proactive  and  incorporates 
ambitious  programmes  for  developing  energy  efficiency  and  renewable 
energies.  Two  methods  have  been  used  to  calculate  emissions  for  this 
scenario:  

-  A modelling method using the MEDPRO predictive tool, identical to 
that used in the baseline case. In this case, the decrease in primary 
energy  intensity  is  estimated  at  an  average  of  about  2.5  per  cent 
per year between 2010 and 2030. 

-  A  bottom-up  method  consisting  of:  (1)  identifying  the  energy 
renewable  energy  actions  one  by  one, 
efficiency  and 
(2)  calculating  the  final  energy  savings  expected  for  each  form  of 
energy,  (3)  calculating  the  primary  energy  savings  for  each  of  the 
actions  on  the  basis  of  assumptions  for  the  electricity  sector 
(specific  consumption,  losses  to  the  network  and  the  mix),  (4) 
calculating emissions avoided on the basis of emissions factors for 
each form of energy, (5) aggregating emissions avoided as a result 
of all of the actions, (6) subtracting these  emissions from those of 
the baseline. 

The  two  graphs  below  respectively  show  the  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  due  to  energy  efficiency  measures  (by  sector)  and  due  to 
renewable energies (by type).

Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions due to energy efficiency and renewable 

energies 

This reduction thus makes it possible to reduce carbon intensity in the energy 
sector  by  approximately  46  per  cent  compared  to  2010.  About  half  of  this 
reduction is due to the national effort, as shown in the following graph: 

                                                           

7 These two projects will be closed in 2018 but it is assumed that the degasification systems will be maintained until 2025. 
Beyond that point it will be assumed that the Tunisian State will be unable to modernize, maintain, or generally manage the 
degasification equipment.

Trajectory from the national effort for energy 

Trajectory from the mitigation objective for energy 

 

Trajectory for the decrease in carbon intensity in the energy sector 

 

Industrial  processes:  The  mitigation  scenario  for  the  processes  sector 
covers  the  launch  of  NAMA  Cement,  which  is  a  mitigation  programme 
with four focuses: (i) Energy efficiency, (ii) Renewable energies, (iii) Co-
incineration of solid waste,  (iv)  Segmentation of the cement  market to 
reduce emissions deriving from processes. 
The  results  of  the  first  three  actions  are  included  in  the  mitigation 
scenario  for  the  energy  sector.  The  impact  of  segmentation  of  the 
cement  market  on  emissions  related  to  the  clinkering  process  is  also 
included  here,  however,  the  energy  impact  of  this  segmentation  is 
included in the low-carbon scenario for the energy sector. 

  Forestry  and  other  land  usage:  The  mitigation  scenario  for  the  FAT 
sector  assumes  the  strengthening  of  reforestation  and  conservation 
actions already considered in the baseline and the addition of three new 
actions.  As  with  the  baseline,  the  calculation  method  is  based  on  the 
2006 IPCC guidelines.  

  Agriculture: The mitigation scenario for the agricultural sector assumes 
the strengthening of actions already considered in the baseline and the 
addition  of  four  new  specific  actions.  Estimates  of  avoidable  emissions 
are  based  firstly  on  the  2006  IPCC  guidelines  and  secondly  on 
international literature concerning certain mitigation actions. Mitigation 
actions  regarding  energy  recovery  from  waste  are  listed  in  this  sector, 
but the results of these actions are included in the low-carbon scenario 
for the energy sector. 

  Waste  

Solid waste: this involves a bottom-up approach combining two actions:  
- 

Introduction of the option to produce RDF to be used for combustion 
in  the  cement  industry.  NAMA  Cement  assumes  the  recovery  of  3 
million  tons  of  solid  waste  (i.e.  only  35  per  cent  of  solid  waste 
generated) for RDF production by 2030.  
Introduction  of  degasification  systems  for  50  per  cent  of  the 
quantities  of  waste  which will  be  buried  in  controlled  landfills  in the 
future,  amounting  to  about  1.5  million  tons  of  solid  waste  by  2030. 
The  low-carbon  scenario  also  covers  degasification  projects  for  the 
two Ministry of Sustainable Development projects beyond 2025. 

- 

Estimates  of  avoidable  emissions  are  based  on  the  calculation  method 

 

Page 12 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Tunisia - 2015 

from  the  2006  IPCC  approach.  Emission  reductions  as  a  result  of  co-
incineration are estimated on the basis of the quantity of waste which it 
is no longer necessary to put into landfill due to the usage of mechanical 
and biological processing for the production of RDF.  
Emission  reductions  as  a  result  of  degasification  systems  on  controlled 
landfills are estimated by using the most recent degasification indicators 
generated by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) landfills in Tunisia.  
The  impact  of  potential  projects  to  recover  energy  from  landfills  is 
included in the low-carbon scenario for the energy sector. 
Wastewater  treatment:  this involves  a bottom-up approach combining 
two  renewable  energy  actions  and  one  action  to  improve  treatment 
processes  in  the  industry.  The  approach  for  estimating  avoidable 
emissions  is  derived  from  the  method  of  calculating  emissions  for 
renewable  electricity  generation,  based  on  an  assumed  COD  reduction 
of about 15 per cent in industrial wastewater. Mitigation actions relating 
to renewable energies  are listed in this sector, but the  results of these 
actions are included in the mitigation scenario for the energy sector.

to emissions 
reductions (up to 2030) 

 
 
 
The  constant  decline  in  carbon  intensity  in  Tunisia  until  2030  stems  from 
significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors. The energy 
sector remains the main contributor to the Tunisian objective in 2030, with 75 
per cent of the reductions in emissions. Waste comes in second place, followed 
by forestry and other land use, and agriculture.

3  The Tunisian contribution towards adaptation  

Climate studies on Tunisia have shown that the country is very exposed to climate change and that 
its economy, population and ecosystems are therefore very vulnerable. 

3.1  Tunisia's exposure to climate change 

Temperature 

Precipitation 

Rising sea levels 

Average  annual  temperature  increase  across  the  entire  country  of  +2.1°C 
until 2050.  

By 2050, a drop of between 10 and 30 per cent - depending on the region - 
in the annual precipitation rate compared to the current situation. Alongside 
these falling values, there will be an increase in the frequency and intensity 
of the extreme weather phenomena: droughts and floods.  

Heightened sensitivity of the  1,300 km coastline  due to rising sea levels. By 
2050,  the  sea  level  is  expected  to  have  risen  on  average  by  30  to  50  cm, 
causing  the  beaches  to  shrink  by  20  to  135  cm  per  year,  depending  on  the 
coastline and the region.  

3.2  Tunisia's vulnerability to climate change 

Water resources 

Coastline 

With  some  385  m3  of  renewable  blue  water  resources  available  per  year  and 
per capita, Tunisia is already experiencing water scarcity.  
This  situation  is  due  to  be  exacerbated  by  climate  change  over  the  coming 
years, with the decrease in conventional water resources estimated at about 28 
per  cent  by  2030.  The  decline  in  surface  waters  would  be  approaching  5  per 
cent by the same year. 
Furthermore,  following  the  expected  rise  in  the  sea  level,  losses  through  the 
salinization  of  coastal  aquifers  due  to  this  rise  in  sea  level  would  account  for 
about  50  per  cent  of  the  current  resources  of  these  aquifers  by  2030, 
amounting to almost 150 million m3.  
The  physical  vulnerability  of  the  Tunisian  coastline  to  rising  sea  levels  has 
various direct and indirect socio-economic consequences: 
- 

Loss by submersion of approximately 16,000 hectares of agricultural land in 
low-lying coastal areas,  
Loss by submersion of approximately 700,000 hectares of built-up areas,  
Loss by salinization of approximately 50 per cent of the resources currently 
available in coastal aquifers, 
Indirect  loss of the potential for approximately 38,000 ha of irrigable land 
by 2050, i.e. 10 per cent of currently irrigated land,  

- 
- 

- 

-  Decline  in  the  activities  of  seafront  hotels,  which  have  a  total  capacity  of 

approximately 30,000 beds, owing to retreating beaches,  

-  Decline in port and shore infrastructure. 
The loss of productive capital caused by this damage is in the order of 2 billion 
US dollars. Losses in annual production are estimated at approximately 0.5 per 
cent of current GDP, mainly in the areas of tourism (55 per cent) and agriculture 
(45 per cent). An estimated 36,000 job losses, mainly in agriculture and tourism. 

Agriculture 

Droughts  caused  by  climate  change  will  particularly  affect  rainfed  cereal 
farming  interests,  which  would  decrease  from  a  current  average  land  area  of 

 

Page 15 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Tunisia - 2015 

1.5  million  hectares  to  about  1  million  hectares  in  2030,  i.e.  a  reduction  of 
approximately 30 per cent.  

Agricultural GDP following the reduction in land area, given yields identical to 
the reference situation, would fall by 5 to 10 per cent by 2030. 

In the event of successive extreme droughts, the land area used for cereal crops 
and arboriculture (mainly regions in the centre and the south) will decrease by 
200,000  and  800,000  hectares  respectively.  Lastly,  the  livestock  population 
would decrease by about 80 per cent in the centre and the south, and 20 per 
cent in the north, owing to the loss of rough grazing areas. 

Ecosystems 

Concerning  ecosystems,  as  well  as water  resources,  the  major  effects may  be 
observed in forests and pastoral ecosystems. 

As  temperatures  and  the  inflammability  of  the  biomass  rise,  the  risk  of  large 
forest  and  bush  fires  also  increases.  It  is  estimated  that  180,000  hectares  of 
forest will have been lost by 2030. In the north of the country, such a risk will 
have  an  impact  on  the  availability  of  water  resources,  and  on  the  population 
and its heritage. 

The  steppe  ecosystems  of  the  centre  and  south  of  the  country  will  see  their 
pastoral functions decline in central Tunisia, and even cease in the south.  The 
herds  will  fall  back  to  the  rough  grazing  areas  in  the  north,  burdening  these 
further and thereby increasing the extent of overgrazing. In the event of climate 
change, if no action is taken to improve the production of rough grazing areas, 
the contribution of steppe ecosystems is likely to have ceased by 2050. 

Health 

The effects of climate change on health in Tunisia will take the form of: 

Tourism 

- 

The resurgence and proliferation of certain vector-borne diseases, such 
as malaria, leishmaniasis or dengue, 

-  Respiratory diseases caused by the rise in temperature,  
-  Water-borne  diseases  caused  by  degradation  of  the  bacteriological, 

physical and chemical quality of water resources.  

Tourism in Tunisia essentially revolves around its image as a beach and seaside 
resort,  which  means  that  it  is  particularly  sensitive  to  the  summer  climate, 
rising sea levels and coastal erosion. 
The  rise  in  temperature  will  make  the  heat  in  summer  more  severe,  affecting 
humans'  climate  comfort  and  making  heatwaves  unbearable  for  the  human 
body. The water stress already experienced by Tunisia will intensify, which will 
have  repercussions  on  tourist  facilities  in  terms  of  operating  costs  and  health 
and safety.  
Concerning  coastal  erosion,  the  annual  losses  to  the  tourist  sector  resulting 
from  the  retreat  of  the  beaches  due  to  the  rising  sea  level  are  estimated  at 
around 5 per cent of the sector's added value.  

3.3  Measures planned by Tunisia to adapt to climate change 

Tunisia is aware of these challenges and has striven for several years to include adaptation to climate 
change  in  the  development  planning  process  at  global  and  sectoral  levels.  Tunisia  has  therefore 
prepared a raft of measures focusing on the adaptation of six key sectors and ecosystems which are 
among the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. 

 

Page 16 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of Tunisia - 2015 

Water resources 

Coastline 

 

Agriculture 

 

The adaptation measures proposed for water resources essentially consist in 
projects to transfer and reuse treated wastewater and to improve and secure 
the  water  supplies  of  large  urban  centres,  especially  Greater  Tunis,  Cap-bon, 
Sahel and Sfax.  

The projects planned essentially concern the rehabilitation of coasts and the 
prevention  of  coastal  erosion:  redeveloping  and  displacing  coastal  industrial 
zones; rehabilitating and protecting existing infrastructure against the risks of 
climatic impacts and developing farms and agricultural infrastructure. 

The  actions  planned  are  essentially  capacity-building  and 
development measures: 

institutional 

-  Adapting irrigated crops in the central regions,  
-  Adapting  mixed  farming-livestock  production  to  climate  change  in 

vulnerable regions, 

-  Updating  the  agricultural  map  to  take  into  account  the  impacts  of 

- 

climate change,  
Introducing a climate monitoring and early warning system, as well as 
an  insurance  mechanism  against  climatic  hazards  due  to  climate 
change, 

-  Conserving  and  exploiting  genetic  heritage  to  adapt  cereal  crops  to 

climate change, developing innovative systems for arable crops. 

Ecosystems 

 

A  number  of  measures  are  planned  for  adapting  ecosystems,  which  may  be 
summarized as follows:  

-  Rehabilitation of forest nurseries and the expansion of indigenous and 

multi-use species, 

-  Holistic management of cork oak forests in zones at high risk of fire in 

the north-west of the country, 

-  Management  of  the  degraded  rough  grazing  and  esparto  areas  in  the 

central and southern regions, 

-  Conservation of the ecological functions of low-lying coastal areas, 
- 

Integrated  rural  development  of  vulnerable  drainage  basins,  sub-
drainage basins and flood control,  

-  Biological consolidation of work to combat silting in the south of Tunisia 
and  support  the  implementation  of  regional  action  plans  to  counter 
desertification. 

The  main  measures  planned  in  the  area  of  tourism  can  essentially  be 
summarized as: 

-  Restoration of the Tunisian touristic sea coast and protection of tourist 

areas against the advance of the sea, 

-  Definition  of  climatic  and  touristic  regions  and  adaptation  of  the 

division of eco-touristic circuits, 

-  Development  of  a  range  of  services  that  are  at  once  alternative  and 
complementary  to  seaside  tourism,  particularly  in  terms  of  health, 
culture, sport and environment. 
Launch and promotion of the concept of ecological hotels, 

- 
-  Optimization  of  the  management  of  water  resources  by  the  tourist 
sector  and  installation  of  mini  seawater  desalination  plants  using 
renewable energies.

This too essentially consists in measures for capacity-building and institutional 
support: 

-  Risk  assessment  and  prevention  of  a  proliferation  of  respiratory 

- 

- 

- 

pathologies linked to climate change, 
Introduction of a network to monitor epidemics of the principle vector-
borne diseases, 
Implementation  and  strengthening  of  the  entomological  monitoring 
network and efforts to fight mosquitoes and sand flies, 
Introduction  of  a  programme  to  adapt  the  health  system  to  climate 
change, especially through protection against water-borne diseases. 

3.4  Needs for adaptation funding 

Investment needs  

The total funding needs for adaptation to climate change would stand at 
about 1.9 billion US dollars for the  period 2015-2030. Besides a number 
of  physical  investments,  these  are  mostly  intangible  investments  to 
support  and  popularize  new  practices  (institutional  support,  capacity 
building, research and development, etc.).
