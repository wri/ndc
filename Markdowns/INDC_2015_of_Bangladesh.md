Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC)

Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) 

Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh
 

Bangladesh's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions 

 
 
1.  National context 
Bangladesh  is  a  highly  climate  vulnerable  country  whose  emissions  are  less  than  0.35%  of  global 
emissions1. Without ambitious action to limit greenhouse gases internationally, the future costs of 
adapting  to  climate  change  will  be  much  higher  than  they  are  today.  If  the  world  fails  to  take 
ambitious action, the costs to Bangladesh of climate change could amount to an annual loss of 2% of 
GDP by 2050 and 9.4% of GDP by 21002. Bangladesh therefore wants to play its part in the global 
collective  action  to  reduce  future  emissions  as  part  of  a  robust  and  ambitious  international 
agreement. 

Consequently, Bangladesh is adopting a two-fold strategy against climate change. The main focus of 
Bangladesh's activities is on increasing our resilience to the impacts of climate change - which are 
already affecting the livelihoods of much of our population and will continue to do so in the future. 
For  example,  extreme  temperatures,  erratic  rainfall,  floods,  drought,  tropical  cyclones,  rising  sea 
levels, tidal surges, salinity intrusion and ocean acidification are causing serious negative impacts on 
the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  millions  of  people  in  Bangladesh,  and  are  gradually  offsetting  the 
remarkable  socio-economic  development  gained  over  the  past  30  years,  as  well  as  jeopardising 
future economic growth. However at the same time, Bangladesh is also working to achieve lower-
carbon  as  well  as  more  resilient  development.  With  this  in  mind,  this  INDC  aims  to  put  forth 
mitigation  actions that  Bangladesh  can  take to  tackle  its  growing  emissions  and  to  play  its  role  in 
global efforts to limit temperature rise to two degrees or preferably 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial 
levels. 

With respect to Bangladesh's contribution to global efforts to counter climate change, this INDC sets 
out a number of mitigation actions that will help limit the country's GHG emissions. These mitigation 
actions will play a key role in realising the move to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and to 
becoming  a  middle-income  country  by 2021 whilst ensuring  that  it  will  not  cross  the average  per 
capita  emissions  of  the  developing  world.    The  INDC  includes  both  unconditional  and  conditional 
emissions  reduction  goals  for  the  power,  transport,  and  industry  sectors,  alongside  further 
mitigation actions in other sectors, which Bangladesh intends to carry out.  Bangladesh intends to 
implement its conditional emissions reduction goal subject to appropriate international support in 
the form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. The 
foundation of this  INDC  is  Bangladesh's existing  strategies  and  plans,  in  particular  the  Bangladesh 
Climate  Change  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  (BCCSAP),  Renewable  Energy  Policy  2008,  the  Energy 
Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan (E&CC Master Plan), the forthcoming National Adaptation 
Plan,  the  National  Sustainable  Development  Strategy,  the  Perspective  Plan  (Vision  2021)  and  the 
Sixth  (and  forthcoming  seventh)  Five  Year  Plan,  the  National  Disaster  Management  Plan  and  the 
Disaster  Management  Act.  In  addition,  it  incorporates  the  outcome  of  further  analysis  and 
consultation  to  enhance  our  existing  plans,  and  to  analyse  future  GHG  emissions  trends  and 
mitigation and adaptation options. 

The INDC of Bangladesh consists of the following elements:  

(cid:190)  Mitigation contribution: 

(cid:131)  An  unconditional  contribution  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  by  5%  from  Business  as 
Usual (BAU) levels by 2030 in the power, transport and industry sectors, based on 
existing resources.

Bangladesh reserves the right to revise its intended national target and contribution at any point 
of  time  and  considers  its  INDC  to  be  a  living  document  that  should  be  integrated  with 
changed/modified national development goals and targets. 

"Business as usual" emissions 

 
 
2.  Mitigation 
2.1. 
As  part  of  the  process  of  preparing  this  INDC,  Bangladesh  has  updated  its  projections  of  future 
greenhouse gas emissions including the development of a "Business As Usual" (BAU) scenario and 
analysis of mitigation potential in three key sectors.  Emissions in the  "Land use, land-use change 
and forestry" (LULUCF) sector were not modelled due to difficulties in obtaining the necessary data.  
Further details of the analysis will be published on the Ministry of Environment and Forests' website. 
 
2.2.  Mitigation contribution 
Bangladesh's mitigation contribution covers the power, transport and industry sectors. Under a BAU 
scenario,  GHG  emissions  in  Bangladesh  in  these  sectors  are  expected  to  represent  69%  of  total 
emissions by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), an increase of 264% by 2030, from 64 MtCO2e in 2011 to 234 
MtCO2e in 2030. 

The contribution Bangladesh is willing to make is set out below. 
Table 1: Intended Nationally Determined Contributions - Mitigation

Bangladesh will reduce its GHG emissions in the power, 
transport, and industry sectors by 12 MtCO2e by 2030 
or 5% below BAU emissions for those sectors.  
Bangladesh will reduce its GHG emissions in the power, 
transport, and industry sectors by  36 MtCO2e by 2030 
or 15% below BAU emissions for those sectors.  
 

These contributions are illustrated graphically below.

This  contribution  is  based  on  analysis  carried  out  throughout  2015  using  the  best  available  data. 
However data quality and availability is an issue in Bangladesh. If new and more robust data comes 
to light in the future, or if assumptions change (e.g. projections of population or economic growth) 
the Government will update its analysis accordingly. This will be coordinated with the next update of 
the  BCCSAP  and  also  embedded  within  the  National  Communication  and  Biennial  Update  Report 
reporting cycle. 

 
 

2.3.  Mitigation actions 
This section sets out some of the mitigation actions that the Government of Bangladesh is currently 
implementing and examples of the kinds of measures that could be implemented in the future to 
meet the contributions set out in section 2.2 above. 
 
2.3.1.  Mitigation objectives 
Bangladesh's  strategy  on  mitigation  is  set  out  in  the  BBCSAP.  This  sets  out  7  programmes  on

2.3.2.  Existing mitigation actions 
Bangladesh  already  has  a  number  of  activities  and  targets  that  are  driving  action  to  reduce  GHG 
emissions, and that will help it meet the unconditional contribution set out in section 2.2, including:

(cid:120)  The country has set aggressive target to scale up the potentials of Solar Irrigation Pumps, 

Solar mini and nano grids to address the energy access issue of off-grid population    

 
2.3.3.     Additional mitigation actions in power, industry and transport 
Bangladesh  will  also  need  to  implement  additional  mitigation  actions  in  order  to  meet  the 
conditional  contribution  set  out  in  section  2.2.  Examples  of  these  are  set  out  in  Table  4.  More 
analysis will be taken in future to consider these options in more detail, based on the availability of 
funding  support  and  internal  capability,  including  as  part  of  a  proposed  INDC  implementation 
roadmap (see section 4), before decisions are taken.

2.3.4.  Additional mitigation actions in other sectors 
As  explained  above,  sectors  other  than  power,  transport,  and  industry  were  not  included  in  the 
quantified  contributions  as  a  robust  data-set  is  not  as  readily  available  for  these  other  sectors, 
making quantification of mitigation potential more challenging. Yet, Bangladesh will carry out more 
work  in  future,  under  the  umbrella  of  the  BCCSAP,  to  improve  analysis  in  other  sectors.  And 
Bangladesh  will  also  continue  to  consider  mitigation  actions  in  these  sectors,  despite  their 

 
 

contribution  currently  not  being  quantified  in  the  INDC.  Examples  of  potential  measures  in  other 
sectors are set out below:

The contribution covers the power sector, and energy use in the 
transport and industry sectors. Other sectors are not included in 
the  quantified  contribution,  but  are  included  as  action-based 
conditional contributions. 
The contribution covers all of Bangladesh. 

The IPCC Revised 1996 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories  and  the  Good  Practise  Guidance  and  Uncertainty 
Management  in  National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventories  were 
used  to  calculate  current  and  future  GHG  emissions.  GHG 
projections were developed to be consistent with Bangladesh's 
aim of becoming a middle-income country by 2021. The exact 
approach  to  estimating  GHG  emissions  was  tailored  for  each 
sector  according  to  the  availability  of  data.  For  example,  GHG 
emissions  from  road  transport  were  calculated  in  a  relatively 
disaggregated  manner,  by  combining  data  on  numbers  of 
vehicles,  distances  travelled  and  the  fuel  efficiencies  of  the 
vehicles.  Similarly,  GHG  emissions  from  electricity  use 
in 
households  were  calculated  in  a  detailed  bottom-up  manner, 
using  data  on  projected  numbers  of  electrical  appliances  and 
their  efficiencies.  On  the  other  hand,  GHG  emissions  from 
industry were calculated using aggregated energy demand data 
per  industrial  sub-sector  and  forecasts  of  future  industrial 
output. Future emissions were modelled using the LEAP model, 
with emissions being calculated from the relevant activity data 
and emissions factors. 
The  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  has  been  calculated  using  the 
100  year  global  warming  potentials  in  accordance  with  the 
Revised IPCC 1996 Guidelines. 
Data was not available to allow for detailed analysis of future 
GHG emissions and mitigation potential in the LULUCF sector. 
Further  work  will  be  needed  to  quantify  this  accurately  (see 
section 4 on INDC implementation). 
The  shortlist  of  mitigation  options  analysed  for  the  INDC  was 
created  from  a  longer  list  by  applying  certain  criteria,  one  of 
which  was  co-benefits.  All  the  measures  are  expected  to 
therefore  have  some  co-benefits.  These  include  improved  air 
quality  (e.g.  from  increased  renewables  or  reduction  in  traffic

congestion),  improved  road  safety  (from modal  shift  to  public

from developing green jobs, cost savings to families (e.g. from 
lower  running  costs  of  cars  and  from  energy  efficient 
appliances) and improved access to energy (e.g. from localised 
biogas production).

Fair and ambitious goal 

 
2.5. 
Bangladesh  is  a  Least  Developed  Country  (LDC)  whose  emissions  are  less  than  0.35%  of  global 
emissions.  However,  Bangladesh  recognises  that  in  order  to  meet  the  2  degrees  objective  all 
countries will need to undertake mitigation in line with the IPCC conclusion that meeting 2 degrees 
requires global reductions to reduce by 40 to 70% global anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions 
by 2050 compared to 2010.  Bangladesh's approach is driven by the long-term goal announced by its 
Prime  Minister  that  its  per  capita  GHG  emissions  will  not  exceed  the  average  for  developing 
countries. Therefore, Bangladesh's approach focuses on putting itself on a pathway which will avoid 
an increase of emissions per capita beyond this level, while pursuing national development goals. 

Despite  its  current  status as  a  LDC  and  its currently  small share  of  past  and  current  global  GHGs, 
Bangladesh is still putting forward actions which will allow the country to embark on a low carbon 
development pathway, keeping in mind the global climate change agenda. This INDC represents the 
first time that Bangladesh has made an international undertaking to take action on mitigation and 
therefore fulfils the requirements of the Lima Call for Climate Action to go beyond existing efforts. 
The actions needed to deliver on these commitments will require international support in the form 
of  finance,  technology  transfer  and  capacity  building.  Bangladesh  will  also  provide  a  relevant 
contribution  with  regards  to  national  financial  resources,  staff  time  and  strong  integration  of 
development and mitigation activities.  

In selecting the actions set out above, Bangladesh has prioritised those which fit with the growth 
priorities  set  out  in  our  national  development  plans.    In  addition,  Bangladesh  has  captured  the 
synergies  between  mitigation  and  adaptation,  not  only  by  prioritising  those  adaptation  activities 
with  significant  mitigation  co-benefits,  but  also  by  seeking  to  minimise  the  carbon  footprint  of 
adaptation portfolio as a whole. The INDC contains a mix of measures that have already been taken 
forward  under  its  own  resources,  thus  demonstrating  that  Bangladesh  is  not  content  to  wait  for 
international support to take action on climate change. 

 
3.  Adaptation 
3.1  Country situation on vulnerability 

Bangladesh, one of the world's most disaster-prone climate vulnerable countries, has faced dozens 
of  major  disasters  over  its  short  history  as  a  nation.  Located  on  the  Bay  of  Bengal,  Bangladesh  is 
particularly  susceptible  to  seasonal  cyclones,  acting  as  a  funnel  for  heavy  precipitation  from  the 
Indian Ocean and creating extreme weather events. The country sits on the flood plain of several 
major rivers, which drain from the mountainous regions of the Himalayas, making seasonal flooding 

 
 

another hazard often coinciding with the cyclone season. Current research and studies suggest that 
flood, tropical cyclones, storm surge and drought are likely to be more frequent and severe in the 
years  to  come.  The  Climate  Change  Vulnerability  Index  (CCVI-2011)  calculated the  vulnerability  of 
170  countries  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  over  the  next  30  years3,  which  reveals  that 
Bangladesh is the most vulnerable country to climate change. 

Climate  change  adaptation  is  a  key  priority  and  the  country  has  already  undertaken  initiatives  to 
mainstream adaptation into national development such as in the water, health, forestry, agriculture 
and  more  prominently  in the  infrastructure  sectors.    Bangladesh  is  already  experiencing  a  host of 
climate impacts, including floods, storm surges, drought and river bank erosion. For example, floods 
in  2007  inundated  32,000  sq.  km,  leading  to  over  85,000  houses  being  destroyed  and  almost  1 
million damaged, with approximately 1.2 million acres of crops destroyed or partially damaged, 649 
deaths  and  estimated  damage  over  $1  billion.  Climate  change  will  drastically  hamper  economic 
growth of the country. For instance, the Asian Development Bank estimated that Bangladesh may 
experience a 2% GDP annual loss by 2050 because of climate change.  

3.2  Adaptation goal 

The primary goal for adaptation is to protect the population, enhance their adaptive capacity and 
livelihood options, and to protect the overall development of the country in its stride for economic 
progress and wellbeing of the people.   

3.3  Adaptation action - past and present 

Over  the  last  three  decades,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  invested  over  $10  billion  (at 
constant  2007  prices)  to  make  the  country  more  climate  resilient  and  less  vulnerable  to  natural 
disasters. Flood management embankments, coastal polders and cyclone shelters have been built, 
and  important  lessons  learnt  on  how  to  implement  such  projects  successfully  in  the  dynamic 
hydrological conditions of Bangladesh and with active participation of communities. 

To  enhance  climate  change  adaptation  activities  in  all  key  policies  and  sectors,  Bangladesh  has 
recently established two innovative funds: the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) from 
the Government's own budget and the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilient Fund (BCCRF) with the 
support  of  development  partners.  Bangladesh  submitted  the  National  Adaptation  Programme  of 
Action (NAPA) in 2005 (revised in 2009) and prepared a climate change action plan (the Bangladesh 
Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan in 2009).   

3.4  Expectations for future - near term plans and action 

Considering the vulnerabilities, the government has identified the following areas of interventions to 
address adverse impacts of climate change: 

Key Areas to address adverse impacts of climate change

Bangladesh  has  already  developed  considerable  infrastructure  and  capability  to  address  these 
climate  change-induced  vulnerabilities  through  disaster  risk  management  and  climate  change 
adaptation. In order to accelerate the present domestic initiatives to adapt to climate change and 
secure  lives  and  livelihoods  of  people,  the  Government  has  allocated  nearly  $  400  million  to 
Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF). As of June 2015 BCCTF has funded over 236 projects 
of which 41 have already been implemented. The projects undertaken so far from BCCTF include: 

(cid:190)  Construction of embankments and river bank protective works 
(cid:190)  Building cyclone resilient houses, excavation /re-excavation of canals 
(cid:190)  Construction of water control infrastructures including regulators/sluice gates 
(cid:190)  Waste management and drainage infrastructure 
(cid:190)  Introduction and dissemination of stress tolerant crop varieties and seeds, afforestation 
(cid:190)  Installation of solar panels. 

Please see details on the country's achievement in the field of climate change adaptation in Annex 1 

A significant number of development programmes are implemented under the revenue budget, and 
the allocation for BCCTF also comes from the revenue budget (FY-2013/14), so the total allocation to 
development  activities  amounts  to  about  32  percent  of  the  national  budget.  An  updated  BCCTF 
project list is provided on the Fund's website4. 
A  good  number  of  climate  change  adaptation  projects  have  been  further  developed  for 
implementation  by  different  ministries  and  departments  like  Local  Government  Engineering 
Department  (LGED),  Water  Development  Board,  Bangladesh  Inland  Water  Transport  Authority 
(BIWTA), Ministry of Disaster Management, Road and Transport Highways Division, Ministry of Road 
Transport and Bridges. Please see the detailed project list in Annex 1.

Furthermore, Bangladesh has prepared a roadmap towards formulating a comprehensive  National 
Adaptation  plan  (NAP)  with  a  view  to  reducing  vulnerability  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  by 
building adaptive capacity and resilience. The NAP is expected to facilitate the integration of climate 
change adaptation into relevant new and existing policies, programmes and activities in a coherent 
manner, in particular development planning processes and strategies, within all relevant sectors and 
at different levels, as appropriate. 

Bangladesh is considered one of the leading countries in managing disasters, and many good lessons 
and practices gathered over the years are being replicated in the context of CCA.  

3.5  Barriers and needs 

Bangladesh  acknowledges  that  climate  change  action  requires  a  holistic  approach  and  further 
acknowledges that many activities will deliver both adaptation and mitigation benefits. For example, 
Bangladesh's national afforestation programme has led to significant afforestation in newly accreted 
lands  along  the  coast  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  as  well  as  reforestation  in  the  adjacent  denuded  hills. 
About 195,000 hectares of mangrove plantations have been raised so far and these new plantations 
are also playing an important role in carbon sequestration. More analysis needs to be carried out on 
future GHG emissions and mitigation options for the LULUCF sector and when this is done, further 
consideration will be given to mitigation-adaptation synergies in this sector.  

Needless to mention, domestic/national initiatives to address climate change vulnerabilities from our 
own resources are far from inadequate compared to what is required to address vulnerabilities of 
160  million  of  the  national  population.  Resources  are  required  from  international  mechanisms  to 
ensure climate resilient development of the country. This will assist in developing a comprehensive 
programme for adaptation and the NAP will form the core element of this progamme. 

Bangladesh acknowledges that monitoring and evaluation of adaptation policies and programmes is 
crucial to ensure that resources are well utilized to increase the overall resilience of our people. The 
objective is to mainstream adaptation initiatives in a National Monitoring, Reporting and Verification 
(MRV) system that is being planned. 

INDC development and implementation 

 
4. 
This  INDC  has  been  prepared  through  consultation  and  dialogue  with  the  Government's  Advisory 
and Technical Committees, which include a range of stakeholders including line ministries, Planning 
Commission, technical departments, professionals, experts, and the private sector.  

With  obvious  reason  the  INDC  implementation  will  be  carried  forward  under  the  framework  of 
updated  and  meaningful  implementation  of  the  Bangladesh  Climate  Change  Strategy  and  Action 
Plan (BCCSAP) and other key policies/plans. The BCCSAP is a ten-year programme running from 2009 
to 2018, to build the capacity and resilience of the country to meet the challenge of climate change. 
An INDC implementation roadmap will be produced in 2016. This will review the current situation 
with respect to implementation of the BCCSAP, identify gaps and support needs, review barriers to 
implementation and present proposals for INDC implementation next steps.  

Specific  activities  to  be  carried  out  in  the  development  of  the  INDC  implementation  roadmap 
include: 

(cid:120) 

List potential mitigation interventions that could be studied in more detail and developed 
into  NAMAs,  along  with  recommendations  on  possible  delivery  levers  (e.g.  incentives, 
standards, fiscal levers etc). 

 
 

(cid:120)  Carry out a review of Bangladesh's current climate finance landscape, support needs and the 
international funding landscape, along with an assessment of climate finance readiness and 
gaps. Produce recommendations on an appropriate climate finance strategy for Bangladesh. 
(cid:120)  Carry out a gap analysis of existing data sharing and reporting structures and processes and 
make  initial  recommendations  on  the  appropriate  form  and  structure  of  a  national  MRV 
system. 
Integration  of  the  Climate  Fiscal  Framework  (CFF)  in  the  national  planning  and  budgeting 
process  to  determine  and  disburse  suitable  yearly  allocation  for  the  implementation  of 
mitigations and adaptation projects/programmes in this stipulated time-frame.  

(cid:120) 

(cid:120)  Carry  out  a  gap  analysis  of  existing  institutional  framework  and  recommend  institutional 
strengthening for effective access of international climate finances including Green Climate 
Fund    

(cid:120)  Make  recommendations  on  appropriate  institutional  structures  for  INDC  implementation 

and coordination. 

(cid:120)  Set  out  a  clear  roadmap  and  timetable  for  actions  across  the  key  elements  of  INDC 

implementation, grouping into short, medium and long-term actions. 

INDC implementation will be taken forward by existing governance arrangements under the BCCSAP, 
with coordination being managed by the climate change secretariat in the Ministry of Environment 
and Forests, reporting to the Advisory Committee and the National Environment Committee (chaired 
by the Prime Minister). Specific implementation activities will be carried out by the appropriate line 
ministries  and  agencies  with  fiscal  support  under  the  fiscal  framework  of  the  Government.  A 
comprehensive  and  robust  INDC  implementation  framework  will  be  developed  in  line  with  the 
existing CFF and other climate change related bodies.  

 
5.  Support for INDC implementation 
Significant resources will be needed to support the implementation of Bangladesh's INDC, including 
finance, technology transfer and capacity building support. This section gives examples of the kinds 
of costs facing Bangladesh, both for adaptation and mitigation, and a brief summary of the existing 
institutional frameworks on climate finance. 
5.1.  Adaptation costs 
Being amongst the countries worst affected by climate change, much of the required resource will 
be  focused  on  adaptation  and  improving  climate  resilience.  The  BCCSAP  sets  out  the  type  of 
investments  needed  to  address  climate  impacts,  early  warning  systems,  improved  irrigation  and 
water management, improved operation and maintenance and upgrading of coastal embankments 
and polders and upgrading of flood protection embankments/drainage systems5.   

It was estimated by the World Bank6 in 2010 that by 2050, adaptation costs of tropical cyclones and 
storm surges will be $55167 million and the annual recurrent cost will be $112 million, whereas for 
inland monsoon flooding the cost will be  $2671 million and the annual recurrent cost will be $54 
million. Just taking these two sectors into consideration, the cost is estimated to be around $6.59 
billion by 2030. 

Bangladesh has already implemented some key adaptation activities as urgent and immediate needs 
of the country. Implementation of identified adaptation measures are very critical to increase the 
resilience of the country to climate change. It was estimated that Bangladesh will need to invest $40

Further  work  will  be  needed  to  assess  the  scale  and  scope  of  investment  needs  for  mitigation 
activities (see section 4 on INDC implementation). But examples of the kinds of investment required 
(2011-2030) to implement key mitigation measures are set out below:

This is expected to ensure better synergy among financing intermediaries to leverage investments 
that  are  greater  than  the  sum  of  their  parts.  Effective  access  to  international  climate  finances  is 
critical for implementation of the Bangladesh INDC to address adverse impacts of climate change for 
sustaining economic growth and thereby aiding to achieve middle-income country status by 2021.
