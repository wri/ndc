1. Afghanistan's National Circumstances and Commitment to Climate Change 

Introduction 

 

Afghanistan  has  extensive  development  and  climate  adaptation  needs  and,  currently,  low  levels  of 
greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  Afghanistan  remains  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world  today, 
with an estimated population of 28.6 million (2015)1 and a per capita GDP of USD 660.2  
 
Afghanistan is highly prone to natural disasters throughout its 34 provinces.3 As a result of climate change, 
it is anticipated that the incidence of extreme weather events, including heat waves, floods, and droughts 
will likely increase, as will climate change-linked disasters such as glacial lake outflows. The majority of 
Afghanistan's population relies directly or indirectly on the available natural resources for their livelihoods 
so  with  these  climatic  changes  the  foundation  of  the  country's  economy,  stability,  and  food  security  is 
under threat. 
 
Despite  these  challenges,  Afghanistan  can  remain  a  low  emission  economy  while  developing  rapidly  if, 
under the Paris Climate Change Agreement, extensive financial and other resources are made available to 
allow Afghanistan to successfully develop and implement Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) 
and Highly Effective Adaptation and Development Strategies (HEADS).  
 
Appropriate support in the form of finance, capacity building, technology and legal assistance is needed for 
Afghanistan to make substantial progress on social and economic fronts while maintaining low per capita 
GHG emission levels. 
 
Description of Fairness and Ambition 

Afghanistan  recognizes  that  all  countries  in  the  world  need  to  make  rapid  progress  towards  lowering,  or 
maintaining  if  already  low,  per  capita  emission  levels  to  avoid  dangerous  levels  of  global  warming.  It  is 
therefore  critical  that  under  the  Paris  Agreement,  financial  resources,  capacity  building,  technology 
transfer,  and  other  support  is  provided  to  Afghanistan  in  order  to  enable  it  to  implement  LEDS  and 
HEADS. This will allow Afghanistan to continue developing while maintaining low level of emissions and 
increasing adaptive capacity to climate change.  
 
There  would  be  lower  costs  and  a  clearer  development  path  for  Afghanistan  if  it  pursued  development 
using mainly fossil fuels, as other countries have. This would likely result in GHG emission in Afghanistan 
continuing  to  increase  at  current  rates  for  the  period  to  2025  and  beyond.  However,  given  the  extremely 
limited  remaining  global  GHG  emissions  budget,  Afghanistan  requires  the  UNFCCC,  the  Global 
Environmental  Facility  (GEF),  the  Green  Climate  Fund  (GCF),  and  other  international  institutional 
arrangements to provide the extra finance and other support needed to successfully implement LEDS across 
all sectors of its economy without compromising socio-economic development goals.   
 
National Development Objectives 

Despite suffering decades of instability and war, Afghanistan has made considerable development progress. 
Over  the  past  13  years  notable  achievements  have  been  made  in  the  areas  of  environment,  agriculture, 
health, education, infrastructure, the economy, and the provision of other important basic services.4 
 
Afghanistan's  National  Development  Strategy  (ANDS) 
is  based  on  Afghanistan's  Millennium 
Development  Goals  (MDGs).  It  identifies  the  environment  as  "a  cross-cutting  issue  that  underpins  the 
entire social and economic development framework for the country." The National Environment Protection 
Agency  (NEPA),  mandated  to  address  environmental  concerns,  continues  to  work  with  all  parts  of  the 
Government  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  (GIRoA)  to  mainstream  environmental  and  climate

change  considerations  into  the  country's  national  development  framework.  NEPA  advocates  for 
appropriate policies and measures that enable rapid development while ensuring good environmental and 
climate  change  outcomes.  Afghanistan  has  developed  its  INDC  with  the  conviction  that  countering  the 
effects  of  climate  change  requires  a  commitment  from  all  countries  with  regard  to  mitigation,  and 
adaptation. 
 
In terms of international commitments on climate change,  Afghanistan joined the UNFCCC in 1992, and 
ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2013. Afghanistan completed its National Adaptation Programmes of Action 
for  Climate  Change  (NAPA)  and  National  Capacity  Needs  Self-assessment  for  Global  Environmental 
Management (NCSA) in 2009. Afghanistan submitted its Initial National Communication (INC) under the 
UNFCCC in 2012, and is currently preparing its Second National Communication (SNC) for submission to 
the  UNFCCC  in  2016.  At  present,  Afghanistan  is  finalizing  its  national  Climate  Change  Strategy  and 
Action Plan (ACCSAP) as well as its National Adaptation Plan (NAP). 
 
In 2015, as part of the INDC preparation process, NEPA convened a series of consultation and awareness-
raising  workshops to  bring  together  decision-makers  from  government  institutions  and  stakeholders  from 
non-governmental  organizations  to  develop  the  current  INDC  and  establish  a  sustainable  development 
vision for Afghanistan. Through this INDC process and existing policies and strategies, the overall vision 
that was developed for Afghanistan aims to enhance the adaptive capacity and resilience of its agriculture, 
environment, and population to climate change, while developing and implementing LEDS.  
 
Climate Change Trends, Impacts, and Vulnerabilities 

Afghanistan is ranked among the most vulnerable countries in the world to the adverse impacts of climate 
change.5  Afghanistan's  INC  report  has  documented  an  increase  of  0.6°C  in  the  country's  mean  annual 
temperature  since  1960.  Based  upon  recent  climate  observations,  precipitation  patterns  have  decreased 
during  springtime  (March-May)  by  approximately  40.5mm;  however,  the  total  annual  precipitation  has 
only slightly decreased by approximately 30mm since there is a slight increase in precipitation from June 
until  November.  This  implies  that  Afghanistan  is  already  beginning  to  experience  the  initial  adverse 
impacts of climate change.  
 
Recent  climate  projections,  based  on  Cordex  regional  climate  models  and  representative  concentration 
pathways  (RCPs)6,  indicate  that  Afghanistan  will  face  an  overall  strong  increase  in  mean  annual 
temperature,  considerably  higher  than  global  mean  projections,  when  compared  to  a  baseline  period  of 
1986-2006. More specifically, under the "optimistic" scenario (RCP4.5), the mean of the model ensembles 
projects  a  warming  of  approximately  1.5°C  until  2050  and  of  approximately  2.5°C  until  2100.  For  the 
"pessimistic" scenario (RCP8.5), the models project an extreme warming of approximately 3°C until 2050, 
with further warming up to 7°C by 2100. Under both scenarios there are regional differences, with a higher 
temperature increases at higher altitudes compared to the lowlands.  
 
For precipitation a significant (α=0.05) mean decrease of precipitation during springtime (March-May) for 
the  North,  the  Central  Highlands  and  the  East  for  both  scenarios  from  2006  until  2050  between  5-10 
percent is seen. This decrease is offset by a slight increase of precipitation during autumn and wintertime 
(October-December)  in  these  regions.  For  the  Hindu  Kush  area,  a  significant  and  substantial  increase  in 
precipitation during the winter season of approximately 10 percent is seen, whereas during spring season 
precipitation  is  projected  to  stay  stable.  For  the  arid  South  of  the  country,  the  models  do  not  project 
significant trends for precipitation. The decrease of precipitation during spring is particularly relevant since 
during these months the main plant growth for agricultural production takes place. In addition, the decrease 

                                                 
5 DARA Climate Vulnerability Monitor (2012); GermanWatch Global Climate Risk Index (2013); and Notre 
Dame Global Adaptation Index (2014). 
6 Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are GHG emission scenarios adopted by the IPCC to describe 
four possible climate futures depending on the levels of future global GHGs emitted. There are four RCPs: 1) 
RCP2.6, which assumes that GHG emissions peak between 2010-2020 and then decline; 2) RCP4.5, which 
assumes that GHG emissions peak around 2040 and then decline; 3) RCP6, which assumes that GHG emissions 
peak around 2080 and then decline; and 4) RCP8.5, which assumes that GHGs emissions continue to rise 
throughout the 21st century.  

 
is  projected  to  take  place  in  the  regions  with  the  highest  agricultural  productivity  of  Afghanistan  (East, 
North,  and  Central  Highlands).  In  combination  with  the  overall  increase  in  temperature  and  the  related 
increase in evapotranspiration across the country, this will most likely negatively impact the hydrological 
cycle,  agricultural  productivity,  and  availability  of  water  resources.  Climatic  changes  are  also  likely  to 
impact  upon  the  spread  of  water,  food  and  vector-borne  diseases,  presenting  considerable  health  risks  to 
both  urban  and  rural  populations.  Finally,  the  aforementioned  climate-induced  risks  and  challenges  can 
enhance  social inequalities,  poverty,  and  food insecurity  causing  considerable  and  fundamental threats  to 
human life, livelihoods, property, political stability, the economy, and the environment in Afghanistan. 
 
Based upon these climate change projections, Afghanistan's environment will experience considerable 
changes over the remainder of this century. Climate change, based on sound scientific analysis of climatic 
changes and uncertainties, must be mainstreamed into sectoral planning to reduce the negative impacts of 
climate change in Afghanistan and increase resilience, both in rural and urban areas.  
 

2. Climate Change Adaptation 

Near- and Long-term Adaptation Visions, Goals and Targets 
 
Afghanistan's  vision  for  addressing  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  through  adaptation  aims  to 
protect the country and its population by enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience, effectively respond to 
the vulnerabilities of critical sectors, and efficiently mainstream climate change considerations into national 
development policies, strategies, and plans. In order to achieve this vision, a national strategy for climate 
change adaptation must include community level vulnerabilities and build up their adaptive capacities by 
investment  in  short-  and  long-term  initiatives.  Short-term  action  plans  formed  part  of  the  2009  NAPA, 
while  the  NAP  will  implement  both  short-  and  long-term  priorities  These  priorities  include,  but  are  not 
limited to:  

1.  Reducing vulnerability of the country and its population through enhancement of adaptive capacity 

and resilience, and deployment of disaster risk reduction approaches  

2.  Integrating climate change consideration into the national planning processes 
3.  Promoting  economic  development  and  sustainable  rural 
livelihoods 

through  sustainable 
management  of  environmental  resources  and  increase  access  to  modern  forms  of  efficient  and 
sustainable energy services 

4.  Improvement of technical capacity in governmental institutions 
5.  Adaptive and integrated land and water management  
6.  Improving  access  by  rural  communities  and  farmers  to  water  to  support  food  security,  reduce 

poverty and improve agricultural productions 

7.  Raising awareness for people of Afghanistan on climate change impacts and adaptation measures  

 

Current Adaptation Undertakings and Support 
 
Afghanistan has initiated a number of steps to promote the country's sustainable development. In term of 
national  development  policies,  plans,  and  legal  frameworks,  considerable  effort  has  been  placed  on 
addressing  environmental  challenges,  disaster  risk  reduction,  food  security,  water  security,  protection  of 
forest and rangelands, and biodiversity conservation, all of which have clear relevance to climate change 
adaptation.  Some  noteworthy  examples  of  such  policies  and  plans  that  have  successfully  and  explicitly 
integrated climate change include:  
 

*  Afghanistan National Renewable Energy Policy (ANREP) 
*  National Water and Natural Resource Management Priority Programme 
*  Strategic National Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction (SNAP) 
*  National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) 
*  National Comprehensive Agriculture Production and Market Development Programme 
*  Energy for Rural Development (ERDA) 
*  National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) 
 

 
 
Additional  national  development  policies,  strategies,  and  plans  that  currently  do  not  mention  climate 
change but have entry points for the further mainstreaming of climate change include:  
 

*  National Agricultural Development Framework (NADF) 
*  National Environment Strategy 
*  Energy Sector Strategy 
*  National Forestry Management Plan 
*  Rangeland Management Plan 
*  Strategic Policy Framework for the Water Sector 

 
In  term  of  programmes  and  projects,  support  provided  by  the  international  community  and  multilateral 
agencies have laid the groundwork for building Afghanistan's adaptive capacity and resilience to climate 
change. Major contributors include the Tokyo Framework bilateral partners, Global Environmental Facility 
(GEF),  which  has  provided  support  through  enabling  activities,  mid-size  projects,  and  full-size  climate 
change  adaptation  projects  funded  by  the  Least  Developed  Countries  Fund  (LDCF),  as  well  as  bilateral 
donors,  non-governmental  organizations,  and  the  United  Nations.  With  the  scale  and  urgency  of 
Afghanistan's  adaptation  needs,  additional  financial  and  other  resources  are  strongly  needed  in  order  to 
effectively  build  the  adaptive  capacity  and  resilience  of  the  country  and  its  people  before  more  severe 
impacts of climate change begin to be felt. 
 
Adaptation Needs and Means of Implementation (MOI) 
 
Afghanistan  faces  a  number  of  specific  challenges  in  terms  of  addressing  climate  change  through 
adaptation. These challenges include, but are not limited to, funding gaps, lack of expertise, lack of reliable 
historical  climate  data,  weak  public  awareness  about environmental  issues,  and security.  Afghanistan has 
identified  the  following  key  actions  as  part  of  its  National  Adaptation  Plan  (NAP)  in  order  to  overcome 
existing  gaps  and  barriers  towards  sufficiently  addressing  its  climate  change  adaptation  needs.  The  total 
estimated cost of full implementation of the NAP is USD10.785 billion over ten years.

3. Climate Change Mitigation 
 
GHG Emissions and Mitigation Measures 
Afghanistan has very low relative per capita GHG emissions. While 1990 emissions were at 0.2 metric tons 
CO2 per capita, data indicates that per capita emissions were around 0.3 for 2010, making Afghanistan one 
of the lowest GHG emitters globally.7 However, the country is on a growth path, which is expected to 
strengthen over the coming years, meaning GHG emissions are likely to increase. It is important that 
support be provided to Afghanistan to develop LEDS to minimize the increase in its GHG emissions. 
 
Afghanistan's overall GHG emission figures (Table 1) demonstrate that the most important sources of CO2 
emissions are from the "Land-Use Change and Forestry" and "Energy" sectors.8 In terms of CH4 and N2O 
emissions, the agriculture sector is the major contributor.9 It is therefore important that greater attention 
should be focused on GHG mitigation measures within these sectors. Afghanistan has only started to access 
UNFCCC technology transfer opportunities. It needs to build national capacity to navigate opportunities 
and play a more critical role in international negotiations.  
The following mitigation options are designed to enable Afghanistan to make a mitigation contribution 
which is condition on support needs for financial and technical support being met.
