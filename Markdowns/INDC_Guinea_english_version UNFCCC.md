1.  NATIONAL CONTEXT 

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY PRIORITIES  

Coming  178th  (out  of  187  countries)  on  the  Human  Development  Index,  the  Republic  of  Guinea  suffers  from 
severe  structural  vulnerabilities,  despite  recent  progress.  The  national  poverty  rate  stood  at  55.2%  in  2012, 
meaning  that  6.2  million  Guineans  were  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Around  one  child  in  every  three  was 
suffering  from  malnutrition  in  2012.  In  short,  few  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  are  likely  to  be 
reached  in  2015.  Nevertheless,  against  a  background  of  strong  demographic  growth  (with  the  population 
doubling  every  25  years),  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  speed  up  and  diversify  economic  growth  to  meet  the 
present social challenges whilst not placing undue constraints on future generations.  

Sustainable  development  is  therefore  still  a  priority  if  the  vital  needs  of  the  Guinean  population  are  to  be 
addressed. Moreover, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the Republic of Guinea are well below the global 
average.  

OBJECTIVE OF THE INDC OF THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA  

The Republic of Guinea ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 
Kyoto  Protocol  in  1993  and  2005  respectively.  Since  then,  it  has  worked  out  strategies  to  combat  climate 
change, including its Initial National Communication, on the basis of an inventory of greenhouse gases (GHG) 
taken  in  2001  (based  on emissions  in  1994).  A  second  inventory  was  taken  in  2011  (emissions  in  2000),  but 
has not yet led to the submission of a new National Communication. Finally, the Republic of Guinea prepared its 
National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) in 2007 and undertook several projects to implement the plan.  

Guinea must now face up to two major challenges: lifting its people out of poverty and ensuring the country's 
food  security  -  with  a  population  growing  at  3%  per  year  and  expected  to  reach  18  -  20  million  in  2030.  Its 
ambition  is  also  to  move  from  the  status  of  Least  Developed  Country  (LDC)  to  that  of  Emerging  Country  by 
2030, which means that GDP must grow by 5-7% per year. Bearing in mind these aims and population growth, 
Guinea's energy needs may well double in the space of 20 years. Consequently, assuming that practices and 
systems remain unchanged, the estimated annual emissions growth rate is +4.4%, i.e. slightly more 
than doubling every 20 years. 

Guinea  has  particularly  abundant  natural  resources,  especially  forests,  meaning  that  it  is  considered  as  a 
carbon sink (Initial National Communication, 1994). In addition, more than 1000 watercourses and four of the 
major  West  African  rivers  rise  in  the  country.  These  resources  are  under  severe  threat  from  the  impact  of 

 

4/15 

climate  change  and  regional  population  flows  are  likely  to  increase  the  pressure.  Because  of  its  geographical 
location, Guinea could become a refuge for people from neighbouring Sahelian countries to the north, especially 
pastoralists who are more seriously affected by drought and changes in rainfall patterns. Moreover, Guinea is of 
great significance to the aluminium industry in the world, as it holds more than one third of the planet's bauxite 
reserves.  

For  all  these  reasons  and  with  a  view  to  making  the  most  effective  contribution  possible  to  its  own  and  its 
neighbours'  sustainable  development,  Guinea  seeks  to  become  a  stabilizing  influence  in  the  sub-region  by 
2030, as a result of: 

  preserving and enhancing its water resources; 
  striving to keep its status as a carbon sink; 
  exploiting its soil and sub-soil resources on a rational basis; 
  stimulating thinking at ECOWAS level with a view to greater consideration of  climate change issues in 

the Regional Transhumance Plan.  

 

There  are  several  possible  ways  of  achieving  these  aims,  such  as  developing  renewable  energies,  improving 
energy efficiency, reducing pressure on the forests through sustainable management of forestry resources and 
land, developing and improving farming and pastoral practices to cope with climate change, etc.  

 

THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER GUINEA'S INDC  

The National Environment Department of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forestry (MEEF) is responsible 
for  co-ordinating  the  implementation  of  government  policy  on  combating  climate  change  and  also  deals  with 
GHG inventories.  

The  National  Consultation  Platform  on  COP21  (hereinafter  PNC-COP21)  was  set  up  on  the  initiative  of  the 
MEEF to mobilize representatives of the State, technical departments, civil society and the private sector so that 
Guinea's  voice  could  be  heard,  taking  on  board  contributions  from  all  relevant  institutions  and  every  level  of 
society.  Its  objectives  include  the  development  of  information  and  communication  concerning  COP  21  and 
raising  the  awareness  of  civil  society  and  economic operators.  It  comprises  a high-level  (ministerial)  segment 
and 11 thematic panels which helped to draw up the INDC. 

 

2.  ADAPTATION COMMITMENTS  

JUSTIFICATION FOR THE INCLUSION OF ADAPTATION IN THE INDC 

Promoting  sustainable  economic  development  that  takes  account  of  adaptation  to  climate  change  is  key  to 
anticipating impacts and thus being able to reduce the expense and damage they can cause. In this regard, it is 
vital  to  include  Guinea's  main  adaptation  challenges  in  the  INDC,  in  order  to  draw  the  attention  of  the 
international  community  to  the  massive  efforts  that  the  country  needs  to  make  to  cope  with  the  negative 
impacts of climate change, as well as to shoulder its responsibilities in relation to the vulnerability of the West 
African sub-region.  

 

Guinea finalized its National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) in 2007, having identified the following vulnerable 
sectors: crop and livestock farming; water; and the coastal and forest zone.  The NAPA also helped to identify 
the  groups  most  vulnerable  to  climate  change  in  different  regions  of  the  country,  including  in  particular  poor 
communities in rural areas such as farmers and small producers (men and women) and people whose livelihood 
mainly depends on the use of natural resources (hunters, fishermen, salt producers, etc.). 

Guinea has ratified the other two Rio conventions and put together national strategies to combat desertification 
and soil degradation, as well as conserve biodiversity. Implementation of these two strategies will also facilitate 
adaptation to climate change.  

IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE  

With its present favourable climate for agriculture (average annual rainfall of 1200 mm in the North and North-
East, 4000 mm in Conakry and up to 1800 mm in the mountains of Fouta-Djalon), Guinea is both exposed and 
sensitive to climate change and has very little capacity to adapt. The main impacts of climate change affecting 

 

5/15 

the  country  include:  i)  an  overall  increase  in  average  temperatures;  ii)  a  drop  in  average  annual  rainfall 
especially  in  North-West  and  North-East  Guinea,  together  with  a  change  in  the  frequency  and  intra-year 
distribution of precipitations; and iii) the rising sea level (around 80 cm by 2100). These new climate conditions 
could therefore have negative consequences for many different sectors.  

Nevertheless, even with altered rainfall patterns, Guinea should still continue to enjoy more favourable climatic 
conditions than its neighbours to the north and could become a more important transhumance destination for 
Sahelian herds than it is now, resulting in serious conflicts over land use.  

 

CURRENT AND PLANNED COMMITMENTS  

Guinea is both sensitive and exposed to climate change. Located at the gates of the Sahel, one of the regions of 
the world most affected by climate change, Guinea must quickly reduce its vulnerability for the benefit of both 
its own people and its neighbours.

In  order  to  deal  with  the  local  consequences  of  climate  change  -  for  which  it  actually  bears  no 
historic responsibility - the Republic of Guinea hereby undertakes the following commitments:  

 

Commitment  

Context and description of the commitment  

Actions 

Guinea  is  considered  as  the  "water  tower  of  West 
Africa".  Four  catchment  basins  of key  importance  to 
the  sub-region,  particularly  due  to  their  potential  in 
terms of economic development and maintenance of 
biodiversity, have their source in Guinea. As a result 
of climate change, the flow rate of watercourses will 
be  reduced,  possibly  by  as  much  as  50%  of  the 
current daily average by 2100. For example, the flow 
of  the  Niger  River  is  likely  to  reduce  everywhere  by 
between  16  and  28%  (sensitivity  2.5°C)  and  up  to 
23-54% (sensitivity 4.5°C). Given Guinea's strategic 
location  upstream  of 
the  main  West  African 
catchment  basins,  choices  in  respect  of  water 
resource  management  will  inevitably  have  impacts 
downstream,  beyond  the  borders  of  Guinea.  These 
international  implications  mean  that  Guinea  has  an 
even  greater  responsibility  to  manage  its  resources 
appropriately in the face of climate change.  

 

The  coastal  zone  is  of  strategic  importance  to 
Guinea. It is the country's leading economic area and 
holds  around  38%  of  its  population.  It  also  plays  a 
key  role  for  the  agricultural  and  energy  sectors  and 
accounts  for  24%  of  national  rice  production. 
Potentially  arable  land  on  the  coast  amounts  to  1.3 
million  hectares, 
including  380,000  ha  under 
cultivation  every  year.  Various  cereal,  fruit  and 
vegetable  crops  and  tubers  are  grown  in  the 
mangrove  hinterland.  More  than  140,000  ha  of  the 
385,000 ha of mangroves currently in existence have 
been converted into rice paddies. As regards energy, 
the mangroves in the zone provide 60% of domestic 
energy for the capital and the main coastal towns.  

The coastal zone is particularly vulnerable to climate 
change  due  to  the  rising  sea  level  and  intensified 
coastal erosion, leading to adverse effects on fishery 
resources, the destruction of infrastructure in coastal 
towns  and  villages  and  the  disappearance  or 
salinization of the rice paddies.  

All these factors mean that the coastal zone is under 
extreme pressure from the economic activities being 
undertaken  there;  the  anarchic  urbanization  that 
arises  from  the  lack  of  a  Coast  Code  and  non-
compliance  with  the  Land  Code;  and  the  impacts  of 
climate change.  

Food security  is not currently guaranteed in Guinea. 
The  priority  is  therefore  to  increase  production, 
despite  the  risk  of  falling  yields  as  a  result  of  the 
impact of climate change.  

Farming  practices  capable  of  ensuring  sustainable 
management  of  land  and  water  resources  and 
limiting GHG emissions are to be encouraged.

GAPS, BARRIERS AND NEEDS  

 

The  Republic  of  Guinea  faces  considerable  socio-economic  challenges  in  addition  to  the  current  and  future 
impacts of climate change. Four main barriers to meeting these adaptation needs have been identified:  

1.  The  huge  costs  of  adaptation,  coming  on  top  of  the  funding  gap  in  respect  of  vital  development  and 
poverty  reduction  needs  (source:  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  2013-2015  -  DRSP-III).  Funding 
needs  for  adaptation  (in  addition  to  development  funding  needs)  are  estimated  at  between  US$670 
million  and  US$1700  million.  The  success  of  international  efforts  to  keep  global  warming  below  +2°C 
would of course help to reduce the impacts and related costs. 

 

 

By  way  of  example,  the  total  cost  of  the  "Mano  River  Union  Ecosystem  Conservation  and  International  Water 
Resources  Management"  project  amounts  to  US$31  million  over  five  years.  Funding  needs  for  the  water 
resources  commitment  alone  could  therefore  amount  to  around  US$300  million  for  the  three  international 
catchment basins over the period 2015-2030. 

 

2.  Gaps in terms of reliable, robust climate data  as well as all statistical data relating to natural resource 

 

management; 

 

8/15 

3.  Inadequate integration via government institutions and local authorities of the adaptation dimension in 

development planning; 

4.  Obsolescence of, and failure to comply with, spatial planning schemes. 

3.  MITIGATION COMMITMENTS  

JUSTIFICATION FOR THE REFERENCE YEAR, COMMITMENT PERIOD AND SECTORS COVERED  

Guinea issued its Initial National Communication to the UNFCCC on the basis of data from 1994. That year was 
therefore  considered  as  a  benchmark  and  all  the  GHG  emission  results  have  been  extracted  or  extrapolated 
from the data in that document.  

Furthermore, for the energy sector, full use has been made of the data for the years 2011 - 2014 produced by 
the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL, 2014) programme, which sets targets for 2030.  

For  the  sake  of  simplicity  and  clarity  and  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  the  PRSP  III,  emissions  avoided  by 
means of SE4ALL activities have been assessed over the period 2015-2030. 

 

The inventory of greenhouse gases made for the Initial National Communication (based on emissions for 1994) 
shows  that  the  energy,  land-use  change  and  forestry  (LUCF)  and  agriculture  sectors  are  the  main 
emitters.  As  they  therefore  represent  a  strategic  priority  for  Guinea  in  terms  of  mitigation,  they  have  been 
included in the INDC.  

 

 

Figure: GHG emissions balance sheet according to the INC, excluding GHG sequestration (1994 data) 

  

The absence from this INDC of commitments relating to the "industrial processes" and "waste"  items is due to 
the fact that:  

- 

- 

these  sectors  have,  according  to  the  assessments  made  (Initial  National  Communication,  work  on  the 
Second National Communication), much lower emissions than the others, bearing in mind emission 
calculation methodologies and the unstructured nature of these sectors; 
collection  and  treatment  of  rubbish  and  wastewater  is  still  very  limited,  despite  the  importance  to the 
population  of  this  sector  in  terms  of  environmental  preservation,  quality  of  life  and  health. 
Nevertheless, in view of projected demographic growth which will affect the level of emissions from the 
waste sector, Guinea's national contribution could, when next revised, include this sector on the basis of 
better  knowledge  of  the  respective  emissions  through  the  establishment  of  appropriate  facilities  and 
management procedures.  

 

 

The 1994 INC takes account of the following trends (continuing through to 2030): 

 

9/15 

Figure: Guinea's projected emissions (excluding LUCF) (source: according to 1994 INC)  

 

 

The  emissions  growth  rate  is  taken  as  4.4%  per  year  over  the  period,  with  emissions  rising  from  2.1  to  2.7 
tonnes  CO2eq  per  capita.  In  total,  that  would  mean  a  doubling  over  20  years  and  emissions  of  some  55m 
tonnes CO2eq in 2030. 

 

MITIGATION COMMITMENTS AND POTENTIAL  

With  a  view  to  joining  in  global  efforts  to  decarbonize  economies,  the  Republic  of  Guinea  hereby

to  a 
combination  of  rapidly  strengthening  demand 
(which  is  likely  to  rise  further  in  coming 
years, 
expected 
development  of  major  mining  sites)  and 
slowly  increasing  supply  due  to  lack  of 
investment  and  the  gradual  deterioration  of 
production  facilities.  The  government's  aim  is 
nevertheless  to  make  electricity  available  to

18.1% in 2011).

households.  This  situation  is  reflected  in 
gradual  loss  of  forest  cover  in  the  urban

(PRONIASE)  plans  to  disseminate  10,000 
improved wood- and charcoal-fired stoves and

GAPS, BARRIERS AND NEEDS  

The investment needed to meet the SE4ALL targets in Guinea is calculated at US$8179 million in current value over 20 years 
(2011-2030).  This  equates  to  around  US$409  million  annual  investment  over  20  years,  including  activities  ongoing  since 
2011.  

At  present,  only  20%  of  the  funds  for  this  investment  plan  have  actually  been  raised  by  the  government  of  Guinea.  The 
funding  needs  for  the  rollout  of  renewable  energies  and  energy  efficiency  alone  are  therefore  calculated  at 
more than US$6.5 billion.

Mines  currently  in  operation  account  for 
around  25%  of  State  revenue.  The  country's 
main  mineral  resources  are  bauxite  (more 
than  30%  of  world  reserves),  iron  ore  (9 
billion tonnes), diamonds, gold, etc. They are 
worked by multinationals, some of which have 
been active in Guinea since the 1960s. Small-
scale (especially gold and diamond) mining is 
also  expanding  and  directly  or  indirectly 
occupies more than 100,000 people.  

 

The  industrial  mining  sector  is  the  leading 
consumer  of  conventional  energy  (electricity 
and  hydrocarbons)  in  Guinea.  It  comprises 
self-producers  of  power  who consume  almost 
half  (47%)  of  the  conventional  primary 
energy available.

GAPS, BARRIERS AND NEEDS 

 

The major mining companies are partially applying the new  requirements of the 2013 Mining Code with regard to carrying 
out environmental and social impact studies prior to any damaging intervention, compulsory compensation and rehabilitation 
of former mines. This Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) commitment could be backed up with the inclusion  of 
risks related to climate change and a requirement to reduce the carbon footprint of mining throughout the value chain.  

Traditional  mine-working,  on  the  other  hand,  is  more  difficult  to  regulate;  making  people  aware  of  legal  provisions  and 
raising their awareness of environmental issues could offer ways forward.  

The Environment Code and 2013 Mining Code provide for a certain number of taxes and royalties. The explosive growth of 
the  sector,  as  anticipated  by  the  Guinean  administration,  could  therefore  generate  significant  revenue.  It  might  be 
appropriate to use some of this revenue, or establish a new tax, to fund the fight against climate change.  

Guinea  has  a  wealth  of  biodiversity,  with 
dense  humid  forests  in  the  south-east,  dry 
forests  in  the  north,  dense  mesophilous 
forests between Boké, Kindia and Mamou, and 
mangrove forests. These are special places for 
the  conservation  of  large  mammals,  birds, 
batrachians,  many  families  of  invertebrates, 
etc. Various endemic species are found in the 
forests. 

In  1994,  according  to  the  Initial  National 
Communication, its forests meant that Guinea 
was a carbon sink.  

In  the  absence  of  available  forest  inventories 
(the last dates back more than 20 years), it is 
difficult  to  get  a  precise  idea  of  how  far 
deforestation  has  gone  in  Guinea.  However, 
there is no doubt that it is rapid due to human 
pressure (i.e. firewood collection, urbanization 
and  farming).  AGRYHMET  spoke  in  2005  of  a 
10.3%  reduction  in  the  area  of  mangroves 
and a 33% shrinkage of the whole forest area 
over the period 1972-2000.

GAPS, BARRIERS AND NEEDS  

The main constraints on this commitment stem from the inadequacy of financial and human resources, the gaps in scientific 
knowledge concerning the pace of forest degradation and the low level of local community involvement in sustainable forest 
management.  

Priority must be given to robust enforcement of regulations (the 1999 Forest Code and the Environment Code) and a review 
of the mangrove management and development plan (SDAM). 

The National Forest Fund and Environmental Protection Fund have nowhere near enough additional resources to fulfil these 
commitments,  especially  as  regards  reafforestation  programmes  and  sustainable  management  of  replanted  areas.  A  more 
detailed  assessment  of  the  arrangements  for  topping  up  funds  is  required,  especially  to  cover  needs  relating  to  the 
protection and enhancement of forest resources. 

 

4.  EQUITY AND AMBITION 

The  Republic  of  Guinea,  classed  amongst  the  Least  Developed  Countries,  faces  considerable  socio-economic 
challenges.  

The GHG emissions of the Republic of Guinea are very low in relation to the global average; the country 
was  even  considered by  the  INC  to  be  a  carbon  sink2.  Guinea's  share  of global GHG  emissions was well 
below 0.1% in 2010. 

Despite this, the Republic of Guinea is planning to implement mitigation measures which will mean a deviation 
of  around  -13%  from  the  ‘business  as  usual'  scenario  by  2030,  not  counting  its  storage  capacity 
through land use and forestry (excluding LUCF). 

5.  PROCESS OF PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING AND 

MONITORING THE INDC 

CROSS-CUTTING ACTIVITIES NEEDED TO PUT THE INDC INTO PRACTICE 

If  the  INDC  commitments  are  to  be  fulfilled,  four  urgent  cross-sector  measures  must  be  implemented  with 
support from the international community:  

-  Meet  the  significant  needs  for  robust,  accessible  data,  cross-sector  medium-term  strategic  planning 
documents and monitoring of natural resources (gathering data on water and forest resources, together 
with meteorological data); these needs can be partially covered through bilateral agreements with some 
regional-scale organizations; 
Promote  the  inclusion  of  climate  change  issues,  especially  regarding  adaptation,  in  planning  and 
budgeting at local, sectoral and national level; 
Take account of gender issues in all development programmes and projects; 

- 
-  Make information on environmental law and the causes and impacts of climate change widely available 

- 

and accessible so as to raise public awareness and educate the Guinean population as a whole. 

SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES TO IMPLEMENT THE INDC

carbon sinks.

concerning the integration of climate issues.  

Creation  of  a  steering  committee  within  the  National  Council  for  the  Environment  and 
Sustainable  Development,  comprising  experts  from  research  institutes,  the  National 
Environment  Department,  Water  and  Forestry  Department,  Impact  Studies  Department  and 
climate correspondents, to monitor and evaluate public policy on combating climate change.  

This committee should have its own funds to ensure that it can fulfil its functions.  

Enhancement  of  the  resources  allocated  to  the  inclusion  of  climate  issues  in  the  Local 
Development  Plans  (Ministry  of  Spatial  Planning  and  Decentralization)  and  Urban 
Development Plans. 

The Republic of Guinea has ratified the three main United Nations Conventions: CBD (1993), 
UNCCD (1997) and UNFCCC (1993). In this regard, better co-ordination of the focal points for 
each of these conventions could help to create synergies.

6.  MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION  

The Republic of Guinea plans to employ the following means to implement its INDC: 

 

National Budget 

The  National  Development  Budget  is  the  primary  potential  resource  for  fulfilling  the  INDC 
commitments.  

A National Forestry Fund and an Environmental Protection Fund were set up in 1985 and 1987 
respectively,  but  struggle  to  collect  the  revenue  deriving  from  environmental  taxes  and 
royalties. Some studies put a figure of around US$40 million per year on this loss of income.  

Feasibility study on the establishment of a National Climate Fund.  

Regional integration  

Sub-regional  integration  of  electricity  production  could  help  Guinea  to  move  further  towards 
exploiting its hydroelectric potential, whilst ensuring cost sharing.  

This remark also applies to management of cross-border catchment basins.  

International donors  

Budget  support required for  the  operation  of  the bodies  responsible  for monitoring/evaluation 
of public policies to combat climate change.  

 

The GEF funds several projects to combat climate change in Guinea; it is assisted by UNDP. A 
project  to  conserve  the  ecosystems  of  the  Mano  River  Union  and  manage  international  water 
resources  is  co-funded  by  the  GEF.  It  is  hoped  that  this  support  will  be  continued  and 
enhanced. 

 

 

14/15 

Carbon markets 

Private funding  

The  World  Bank  is  currently  funding  a  programme  of  support  to  governance  in  the  mining 
sector,  including  an  environmental  component.  Discussions  have  begun  with  the  French 
Development  Agency  (AFD)  on  strengthening  enforcement  of  the  Mining  Code  as  regards 
compensation  for  environmental  degradation  caused  by  mining  activities.  Such  support  is 
keenly awaited for the fulfilment of the INDC commitment concerning mining. 

 

Institutional support will be sought for capacity-building to enable Guinea to appoint and seek 
accreditation  of  a  national  implementing  entity,  thereby  gaining  direct  access  to  the  Green 
Fund.  

As  an  LDC,  Guinea  needs  strong  support  from  the  Green  Fund  particularly  for  programmes 
relating to food security and energy efficiency.  

Guinea is a  Non-Annex I  country under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) and classed as a Least Developed Country (LDC). It supports the inclusion of 
the international carbon markets, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), in a post-
2020 agreement on climate and proposes that such an instrument, coupled with an appropriate 
accounting system (Measuring, Reporting and Verification - MRV), should be used to help fund 
certain  investments  in  low-carbon,  climate  change  resilient  infrastructure.  Guinea  considers 
that  some  of  the  low-carbon  development  options  contained  in  this  INDC,  or  additional 
activities, could be funded wholly or in part through the international transfer of carbon assets, 
whilst taking considerations of environmental integrity and transparency into account. 

Nevertheless, as no CDM project has been validated so far in Guinea, capacity-building would 
be essential.  

Furthermore, the Republic of Guinea has not yet formulated a REDD+ strategy, although it is in 
contact with the FAO to assess the country's needs in this connection. 

The  Republic  of  Guinea  is  particularly  short  of  resources  to  meet  the  investment  needs  of  its 
national  budget.  Increased resort  to private  finance  could,  in  this  connection,  help  to  step  up 
fulfilment  of  the  commitments.  Efforts  made  to  improve  the  business  climate  (Guinea's 
progress in the World Bank Doing Business ranking bears witness to this) are likely to increase 
the investment propensities of private operators. 

In this regard, it can be seen that the social and environmental framing of private investment is 
somewhat  uneven.  Relatively  exemplary  in  the  case  of  the  mining  sector,  regulation  is  less 
restrictive in other sectors (e.g. forests). Use of public-private partnerships should therefore be 
preceded by in-depth evaluation.  

Finally,  the  Guinean  diaspora  could  make  a  more  active  contribution  to  the  country's  low-
carbon, climate change resilient development, namely by redirecting its financial flows (around 
US$150 million per year) towards the formal sector.
