UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA 

 

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (INDCs) 

 

1.  Introduction  
 
The  United  Republic  of  Tanzania,  which  comprises  of  Tanzania  Mainland  and  Zanzibar, 
brings  forth  her  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (INDCs)  guided  by  both 
national and international contexts. These INDCs were prepared in consistence with decision 
1/CP.20, and will be implemented by 2030. 
 
Tanzania  is  already  experiencing  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change.  Current  climate 
variability and change resulting in extreme weather events already lead to major economic 
costs  in  Tanzania.  Every  annual  event  has  economic  costs  in  excess  of  1%  of  GDP,  and 
occurs  frequently,  reducing  long-term  growth  and  affecting  millions  of  people  and  their 
livelihoods.  The  net  economic  costs  of  addressing  climate  change  impacts  could  be 
equivalent  to  a  further  1  to  2%  of  GDP  per  year  by  2030.    Climate  change  impacts  are 
affecting  coastal  zones,  public  health,  energy  supply  and  demand,  infrastructure,  water 
resources,  agricultural  production  and  availability  of  ecosystem  goods  and  services. 
Potentially,  there  will  be  high  economic  costs  across  these  sectors.    Current  climate 
vulnerability  and  future  climate  change  adverse  impacts  are  significant  to  curtail  Tanzania 
from  achieving  key  economic  growth,  development  and  poverty  reduction  targets  for 
reaching middle income developing country status.  
 
Tanzania  has  been  undertaking  various  efforts  towards  addressing  climate  change  in 
accordance with her national context. The National Climate Change Strategy (2012) and the 
Zanzibar  Climate  Change  Strategy  (2014)  comprehensively  elaborate  adaptation  and 
mitigation actions. The strategies aim to, among others, enhance adaptive capacity to climate 
change thereby ensuring long term resilience; resilience of ecosystems to climate change; and 
enhanced  participation  in  climate  change  mitigation  activities  to  contribute  to  international 
efforts while ensuring sustainable development. The two climate change strategies and other 
national climate change and development related documents and processes were the basis for 
the  identification  of  adaptation  and  mitigation  priorities  along  with  detailed  consultations 
with sectoral experts and other stakeholders.   
 
In  addition,  Tanzania  has  adopted  and  implements  various  other  policies,  legislations, 
strategies, plans and programmes in the course of addressing climate change. Some of these 
are: the National Communications (2003 and 2015); the National Adaptation Programme of 
Action  (2007);  Natural  Gas  Policy  (2013);  the  Zanzibar  Environmental  Policy  (2014);  the 
Renewable Energy Strategy (2014); the Natural Gas Act (2015); the National Forestry Policy 

 
(1998);  the  National  Transport  Master  Plan  (2013);  the  National  Environmental  Policy 
(1997); the Zanzibar Environmental Policy (2013); the National Environmental Action Plan 
(2012  -  2017);  the  National  REDD+  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  (2013)  and  the  National 
Environment Management Act (2004). 
 
The  Economics  of  Climate  Change  reports  for  Tanzania  mainland  and  Zanzibar  (2012) 
provide  indicative  costs  of  Business-as-Usual  (BAU)  and  a  good  basis  for  estimating 
adaptation  and  mitigation  costs  required  to  enhance  adaptive  capacity  and  long  term 
resilience in Tanzania. Accessing financial resources to meet the estimated costs is necessary 
in  supporting  Tanzania's  efforts  to  meet  socio-economic  development  goals  while 
contributing to the international climate change agenda.  
 
An initial estimate of immediate and start-up financing needs for enhancing adaptive capacity 
is about USD 150 million. In addition, about USD 500 million per year is needed to address 
climate change adaptation and building resilience up to 2020, increasing up to USD 1 billion 
per year by 2030. These costs are likely to increase further depending on global mitigation 
efforts.  Estimated  costs  are  up  to  US$  60  billion  by  2030  in  mitigation  investments  in 
Tanzania.  
  
2.  Principles and Assumptions  
The implementation of these INDCs will be guided by the principles of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change particularly the Principle of Equity and that of 
common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  In this context, it is 
assumed that the identified INDCs will: 

a)  Contribute  to  building  adaptive  capacity  and  enhancing  long-term  resilience  to  the 

adverse impacts of climate change. 

b)  Contribute  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  efforts  to  meet  the  ultimate 
objective of the Convention while achieving sustainable development consistent with 
national development agenda and priorities. 

c)  Be implemented in a participatory and voluntary manner. 
d)  Be implemented, as Tanzania's incremental contributions beyond our current efforts 
and upon availability of adequate and predictable financial and technological support 
from the international community. 
 

3.  Methodological approach 
The  INDCs  were  prepared  in  a  consultative  and  inclusive  manner  through  technical  and 
policy  dialogues.  A  national  technical  team  was  established,  with  representatives  from 
various sectors and relevant institutions. Broad based national and sub-national stakeholders' 
consultative  workshops  were  held  during  the  process.  The  consultations  brought  together 
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Academic and Research institutions, the Private sector, 
and government institutions from across the country.  
 
National  policies,  legislations,  strategies,  programmes  and  action  plans  together  with 
UNFCCC  decisions  guided  the  preparation  of  these  INDCs.  Priority  sectors  on  both 
adaptation  and  mitigation  were  identified  through  a  review  of  various  climate  change  and 
economic  development  relevant  documents.  Adaptation  priority  sectors  are:  Agriculture, 
Livestock,  Coastal  and  Marine  Environment,  Fisheries,  Water  resources,  Forestry,  Health, 
Tourism, Human Settlement and Energy. Identified mitigation priority sectors are: Energy, 
Transport, Forestry and Waste management.  
 

 
The mitigation scenario analysis utilized data from the Initial National Communication (INC) 
and Second National Communication (SNC) and other data was from secondary sources. The 
year 2000 was used as a base year for calculating the baseline (business-as-usual) projection 
scenario. High and low ambition projections provided a range of deviation against the BAU 
baseline.    The  data  to  develop  accurate  bottom-up  estimates  of  the  contributions  of  the 
INDCs  were  not  adequate  to  provide  a  sector-by-sector  emissions  reduction  between  2020 
and 2030. 
 
4.  Planning process 
 
The  INDCs  are      in  line  with  the  Tanzania  Development  Vision  (2025),  Zanzibar  Vision 
(2020), Tanzania Five Year Development Plan (2011/12-2015/16), and are anchored in the 
National Climate Change Strategy (2012) and the Zanzibar Climate Change Strategy (2014).  
 
5.  Intended Contributions 
  
Tanzania  has  negligible  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  (total  and  per  capita),  whereby  per 
capita emissions are estimated at 0.2 tCO2e1. On the other hand, the country has a total of 88 
million  hectares  of  land  areas,  of  which  48.1  million  are  forested  land  and  under  different 
management regimes, with a current estimated total of 9.032  Trillion tones of carbon stock. 
The estimates are based on the present stocks from limited studies. This implies that Tanzania 
is a net sink.  
 

5.1 Adaptation contributions 

 
Climate change projections in Tanzania indicate a consistent change in key climate variables, 
including warming from 0.50C in 2025 up to around 40C in 2100, with more warming over 
the  South  Western  part  of  the  country.  Mean  seasonal  rainfall  is  projected  to  decrease 
consistently and progressively for the most parts of the country, but more significantly over 
the North-eastern highlands, where rainfall is projected to decrease by up to 12% in 2100. In 
this  context,  the  frequency  and  severity  of  extreme  climate  change  related  events  will 
increase. In the last 40 years Tanzania has experienced severe and recurring droughts with 
devastating effects to agriculture, water and energy sectors. Currently more than 70% of all 
natural disasters in Tanzania are climate change related and are linked to recurrent droughts 
and floods.   
Tanzania  will  embark  on  a  climate  resilient  development  pathway.    In  doing  so  the 
adaptation  contributions  will  reduce  climate  related  disasters  from  70%  to  50%,  and 
significantly reduce the impacts of spatial and temporal variability of declining rainfall, 
frequent  droughts  and  floods  which  have  long  term  implications  to  all  productive 
sectors  and  ecosystems,  particularly  the  agricultural  sector.  Access  to  clean  and  safe 
water will be increased from 60% to 75% and, based on a conservative and a worst-case 
scenario  of  50cm  and  1m  sea-level  rise,  the  contributions  will  verifiably  reduce  the 
impacts  of  sea  level  rise  to  the  island  and  coastal  communities,  infrastructure  and 
ecosystems.

5.2 Mitigation contributions 

 
For the global effort to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change, a below 2oC scenario 
requires serious mitigation actions including a "substantial deviation from baseline" by 2050 
in all developing countries. Tanzania continues to undertake various efforts, which contribute 
to the global mitigation agenda. Beyond enhancing carbon sinks through forest conservation, 
afforestation and reforestation, the country is embarking on enhanced use of natural gas with 
53.28 trillion cubic feet discovered reserves of which to-date over 100 million cubic feet are 
exploited to produce 501 MW. There is also expanded use of renewable energy sources such 
as geothermal (with a potential of 5 GW); solar with average sunshine of more than 9 hours 
per day; hydro with a potential of 4.7 GW (while the installed capacity is 561 MW); and wind 
with speed of 0.9 - 9.9 m/s across many parts of the country.  
 
Tanzania will reduce greenhouse gas emissions economy wide between 10-20% by 2030 
relative  to  the  BAU  scenario  of  138  -  153  Million  tones  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent 
(MtCO2e)- gross emissions, depending on the baseline efficiency improvements, consistent 
with  its  sustainable  development  agenda.    The  emissions  reduction  is  subject  to  review 
after the first Biennial Update Report (BUR). 

In the transport sector, Tanzania has a total railway track length of 3,687 km and a tarmac 
road network of 17,742 km that promote mass transport. In addition, the rapid transport and 
mass  marine  transport  systems  are  being  improved.    Waste  management  systems  in  the 
country  are  being  enhanced  by  encouraging  private  sector  and  community  involvement  in 
waste  to  energy  management  approaches;  enhancing  management  of  waste  disposal  sites; 
encouraging waste recycling and re-use; mapping and identifying informal dump sites; and 
implementing landfill gas recovery as well as electricity generation programmes. 
 
The intended contributions in the sectors of energy, transport, forestry and waste management 
will enable the country to achieve low emission growth pathway while achieving the desired 
sustainable  development.  These  sectors  are  among  the  top  contributors  towards  economic 
development in Tanzania. The intended contributions by these sectors are considered fair and 
ambitious  in  light  of  Tanzania's  national  circumstances  and  for  achieving  the  UNFCCC 
objective.

6.  Means of Implementation  
 
Tanzania will continue its adaptation efforts to enhance resilience, strive to achieve Vision 
2025  and  contribute  more  towards  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  efforts.  
Effectively implementing mitigation and adaptation contributions will require timely access 
to adequate and predictable financial resources; access to appropriate technologies; access to 
appropriate knowledge and skills; and institutional capacity building.  
 
Tanzania's  capacity  to  undertake  strong  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions  beyond  national 
efforts  depend  on  support  for  implementation.  In  addition,  enhancing  capacity  in  early-
warning  systems  across  sectors,  improved  research  and  systematic  observations,  improved 
climate change institutional capacity and coordination as well as awareness will be critical in 
addressing climate change. As indicated in section 1, the total amount of financial resources 
needed  for  implementation  of  the  identified  adaptation  contributions  is  about  USD  500 
million  to  1billion  per  annum,  and  a  total  of  USD  60  billion  for  mitigation  contributions. 
Therefore,  implementation  of  the  identified  INDCs  will  strongly  depend  on  how  the 
international  community  meets  its  commitments  in  terms  of  financial  and  technological 
support.  
 
7.  Review processes 
 
The implementation of INDCs is based on the country's various policies, development vision 
programmes, strategies and action plans, which are set to be reviewed regularly. Therefore, 
the  submitted  INDCs  will  be  reviewed  in  a  participatory  manner  to  reflect  the  emerging 
needs, changes and decisions, particularly the outcome of the 21st Conference of the Parties 
(COP 21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, December 2015.
