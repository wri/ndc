ISRAEL'S INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (INDC) 

 

Submission to the ADP 

29 September 2015 

 
In accordance with Decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, Israel hereby 
communicates its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) 
to contribute to the global effort for achieving the objective of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.   
 
Israel is committed to working towards an ambitious international 
agreement on climate change, applicable to all Parties and in line with 
the objective of an average global temperature increase below two 
degrees Celsius. 
 
Mitigation target 
 
Israel intends to achieve an economy-wide unconditional target of reducing its 
per capita greenhouse gas emissions to 7.7 tCO2e by 2030 which 
constitutes a reduction of 26% below the level in 2005 of 10.4 tCO2e per 
capita. An interim target of 8.8 tCO2e per capita is expected by 2025.  
 
According to the most recent national greenhouse gas inventory 
prepared by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, Israel's greenhouse 
gas emissions in 2012 were 83.04 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to 10.5 
tCO2e per capita. Under an updated Business as Usual (BAU) scenario 
greenhouse gas emissions are expected to increase to 105.5 MtCO2e in 
2030. This will be equal to 10.0 tCO2e per capita. Implementation of 
Israel's national target will result in a reduction of 23.85 MtCO2e in 2030 
bringing total emissions down to 81.65 MtCO2e.

           Metric applied  
           The revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
           Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the Global     
           Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC Second Assessment     
           Report (1995) 
            

Methodology 
The scenarios (BAU and abatement) were developed using the Long 
range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP model).  A cost benefit 
analysis was carried out on a range of abatement measures and 
technologies in various sectors. Mitigation potential was assessed in 
those sectors and combined for the whole economy.  
 

Planning process 

An inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the Director General of the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection, examined the potential for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2030. The committee consisted of 
representatives from all relevant government ministries, public utility 
companies, industry and commerce, local government, environmental 
and non-governmental organizations, academia and other national and 
international experts from various disciplines. Specific working groups 
assessed and quantified the costs and benefits of over a hundred 
different abatement measures in each of the main sectors in the 
economy, including energy, transportation, buildings, industry and 
 

waste. At the same time, removal of obstacles to implementation was 
examined.  
 
Based on the comprehensive work and findings of the committee, a 
national emissions reduction target for Israel was formulated and is 
expected to yield significant benefits to the economy. Submitted jointly 
to the government by the Ministers of Environmental Protection, 
Finance and National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources the 
target was approved and includes sector specific targets:  

*  Energy efficiency - 17% reduction in electricity consumption 

relative to BAU scenario in 2030 

*  Renewable energy - 17% of the electricity generated in 2030 will 

be from renewable sources 

*  Public transport - 20% shift from private to public transportation.   

 
 
Future development 
 
The government decision for the national target stipulates that within 45 
days of approval, the relevant ministries are to submit to the 
government an outline of economy wide measures to be taken. It is 
anticipated that the implementation plan will consist of, inter alia, the 
following: 

*  The establishment of mechanisms leveraging large scale private 

funding together with public funding of energy efficiency projects; 

*  A program of tenders for renewable energy. The 17% renewable 

energy target is substantially more ambitious than Israel's current 
10% target for 2020; 

*  Removal of barriers for the uptake of renewable energy; 
*  Measures to increase the use of natural gas. The recent discovery 

of additional natural gas reserves off the coast of Israel has and 
will continue to contribute to a partial switch from coal to natural 
gas in Israel's fuel mix and which contributed to GHG emissions 
reduction between 2012 and 2015. The government is now 
working on the further development of gas fields, expected to 
have significant mitigation potential; 

*  Further development of public transport systems in major 
metropolitan areas such as the construction of the Tel Aviv 
metropolitan light rail; the extension of the intercity rail system 
and of the Jerusalem light rail. 
 

 
Initial steps have begun for the establishment of a national system for 
managing and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. Quantitative and 
qualitative data collection and analysis will be carried out in order to 
track and record headway on implementation of the abatement 
measures.  The inter-ministerial committee will perform a regular review 
process of the national strategy and recommend new policy instruments 
where necessary.   
  
Consideration of fairness and ambition 

Taking into consideration its national circumstances, Israel believes its 
target to be fair and ambitious reflecting genuine efforts to move 
forward in a sustainable manner to facilitate the transition to a low-
carbon and climate-resilient economy.  
 
Israel contributes about 0.2% of global emissions. Israel's projected 
annual population growth is 1.8%, which is considerably higher than the 
OECD average. The assumption is that by 2030, Israel's population will 
be approximately 10.6 million as compared to 7 million in 2005 and 8.4 
million in 2015. The annual GDP growth per capita is currently 1.7% and 
is also growing at a faster rate than the OECD average. 
 
Considering this projected growth in population and GDP, we believe 
that a per capita target for GHG emissions reduction is fair and 
appropriate for Israel. 
   
Israel is a small and densely populated country characterized by an 
expanding population and economic growth, facing land and water 
scarcity. Arid zones comprise over 45% of the area of the country while 
there is an exceptionally high degree of biological diversity that must be 
protected. 
  
Electricity generation has been largely based on imported fossil fuels as 
Israel has no access to a number of widely used low-carbon sources of 
energy  such as nuclear, hydro-electric and geothermal power. The 
country is an energy island, without the possibility of grid 
interconnectivity.  There is limited surface area available for large-scale 
energy installations. The few available areas are subject to competing 
uses such as industrial development and housing, bio-diversity 
preservation, habitat conservation, agriculture and defense.  
 

For many years, there has been significant use of solar heaters for water 
heating and greenhouse gas emissions from this source are substantially 
lower than the global average.  An additional factor limiting Israel's 
abatement potential is its small heavy industry sector with relatively low 
emission levels.  
 
Israel attains extremely high levels of water reuse (85%). However to 
meet increasing water demand several desalination plants have been 
constructed. These installations are comparatively energy efficient and 
currently account for 5% of energy consumption. Water scarcity may 
necessitate the construction of additional plants in the future.  
 
 
Adaptation   
Israel is currently in the final stages of drafting its National Adaptation 
Plan which is the result of an inter-ministerial and non-governmental 
sectorial consultative process. 
 

 

An Israeli Climate Change Information Center (ICCIC) was set up in 
cooperation with leading academic institutions. Its mandate is to 
compile a national scientific base on the impact of climate change on 
areas such as, water resources, biodiversity, public health and urban 
planning. The Center will prepare policy recommendations to be 
integrated into national and local adaptation plans and which will be 
relevant to the challenges being faced in the region as a whole.
