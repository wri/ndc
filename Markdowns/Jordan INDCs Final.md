Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)1 

 

Jordan's INDC Summary 

Jordan nationally determines to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by a bulk of 14 % until 2030. This 

contribution of GHGs reduction will be unconditionally fulfilled at, maximally, 1.5 % by the Country's own means 
compared to a business as usual scenario level. 

However, Jordan, conditionally and subject to availability of international financial aid and support to means 

of implementation, commits to reduce its GHGs emissions by additional, at least, 12.5 % by 2030.  

The outcome targets above are accompanied by a diverse combination of numerous GHGs cut-
oriented actions in all involved sectors of emissions in addition to the adaptation actions in targeted 
sectors. These actions (policies, strategies, legislations, measures, etc) are articulated in this 
document. The methodological approaches underlying Jordan's INDC are included in this 
communication as well.

1.  Welcoming Remarks to Jordan's INDCs 

The  Government  of  the  Hashemite  Kingdom  of  Jordan  (GoJ)  welcomes  you  to  Jordan's  diversified  (a  wide 
rainbow  of  combination  of  outcomes  and  actions)  INDC.  Jordan  believes  that  such  contribution  sets  an 
ambitious target, proportionate to the circumstances of such a small developing country if necessary financial 
support  and  means  of  implementation  made  available  to  the  country  to  implement  such  contribution.  The 
unconditional outcome target is aiming at reducing Jordan's greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions by 1.5 % by 
2030  compared  to  a  business  as  usual  scenario  levels.  The  conditional outcome  target  is  aiming  at  reducing 
Jordan's GHGs emissions by 12.5 % by 2030. The two targets will be achieved based on implementing at least 
70+  projects  (43  sectoral  projects  resulted  from  the  mitigation  scenario  assessment  articulated  in  the  2014 
Third National Communication Report to UNFCCC and another around 27+ sectoral priority projects proposed 
concurrently or newly planned and not listed in the TNC Report, i.e., proposed after the development of the 
TNC. The later group of projects was disseminated to INDC document by involved stakeholder line ministries 
and  organizations  in  response  to  INDC  formulation  process.  This  70+  project  14-percent  INDC  of  Jordan,  of 
which  many  projects  are  now  under  execution  by  relevant  institutions,  will  be  implemented  under  the 
guidance of the overarching  national Climate Change Policy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 2013-2020. 
The  climate  change  policy  of  Jordan  is  a  holistic  nation-wide  policy  encompassed  strategic  objectives  and 
measures for mitigation and adaptation. It is considered the first of its kind in the Arab Region and, in terms of 
sectoral  coverage,  in  the  Middle  East,  covering  the  pre-2020  period,  which  was  developed  voluntarily  as  a 
demonstration  of  the  self-commitment  of  a  small  yet  an  ambitious  country.  The  Policy  itself  as  well  will  be 
extended at the end of its term to 2030 (another ambitious action-style contribution of Jordan) to concurrently 
go in line with and serve as an overarching umbrella guiding and monitoring the implementation of the 70+-
project 14-percent GHGs emission reduction pathway of activities until 2030.  

This  combination  of  a  holistic  national-level  Policy  aiming  at  guiding  sectoral  objectives  and  measures, 
accompanied  by  an  ambitious  mitigation  target  decided  upon  by  GoJ,  which  could  be  met  systematically  if 
sufficient support is effectively provided to the country, will be a first, yet a serious step in line with the 2°C 
objective. 

The estimated cost to reach the 14% target is totaling USD 5,700,000,000 from which GoJ has already secured 
USD 542,750,000 by its own means to meet the unconditional target; which means the Country is in need of 
                                                           
1 Jordan's INDC development process was supported by GIZ through the Global GIZ Project "Support to Selected Partner Countries in Developing their Intended 
Nationally Determined Contributions (GIZ-INDCs Global Project)"- A project of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). 

USD 5,157,250,000 to fulfill its conditional target. 

 

 

With regard to adaptation to climate change and before developing of the National Climate Change Policy of 
Jordan 2013-2020, which advanced concrete strategic objectives, measures, and instruments to adapt the Country 
to  climate  change  impacts  in  each  involved  sector  (water,  coastal  areas,  agriculture/food  security,  health,  tourism, 
biodiversity, and socioeconomic situation/poverty), Jordan conducted (2009-2013) a major joint program of water 
and health sectors' adaptation namely "Adaptation to Climate Change to Sustain Jordan's MDG Achievements" 
with  a  total  budget  of  USD  4.13M.  The  program's  outcomes  were  to  develop  sustained  access  to  improved 
water supply sources, despite increasing water scarcity due to climate change and to strengthen the capacity 
for health protection and food security under conditions of water scarcity. Moreover, and in continuation of 
national actions, the Country mainstreamed climate change in its National Strategy and Action Plan to Combat 
Desertification  (2015-2020) which  was  recently  aligned with the  global  UNCCD 10 year  Strategy.  Jordan also 
mainstreamed climate change into the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2020), which was 
also recently aligned with the global CBD-10 year Strategy.  

Finally, all sustainable development-oriented plans in the country have led to a crowning national effort, which 
will be the development of a national strategy and action plan for transitioning towards the green economy in 
Jordan  (2016-2025)  which  is  currently  under  development.  All  of  such  climate  change-response  actions 
demonstrate the extraordinary efforts and the size of involvement of such a small country in the fight against 
climate change.  

2.  Climate Change and Sustainable Development Circumstances in Jordan  

2.1. GHGs and climate change actions undertaken pre-2020 

Based  on  the  base  year  2006,  Jordan's share in  global greenhouse gas  emissions was 28,717  Gg  of  CO2  eq.,  
which is 28.72 million ton (Mt) of CO2 equivalent (detailed breakdown of emissions shares per surveyed sectors 
and covered gases is provided in the TNC Report to UNFCCC and the accompanying inventory submitted in late 
2014). The Country's bulk share of GHGs represents only around 0.06% of global total according to a global GHGs 
analysis conducted in 20102. According to World Bank, the CO2 metric tons per capita emission is 3.4 in 2010. 
As Figure 1 below illustrates, energy (including transport)-related activities have the dominant share of GHGs 
emissions in Jordan totaling 73% followed by almost close percentage for both waste and industrial activities 
totaling  10%  and  9%  respectively.  Activities  from  Agriculture  and  LULUCF  have  the  lowest,  also  close 
percentages, of 5% and 3.0 % respectively.  

Figure 1. Jordan's greenhouse gas emissions by sectors in 2006. 

 

These  emissions  are  expected  to  grow  according  to  the  2006  baseline  scenario  used  in  the  TNC  (2014)  to 
38,151 Gg, 51,028 Gg and 61,565 Gg of CO2 eq. in the years 2020, 2030 and 2040 respectively due to normal 
growth models. The role of the energy sector and sub-sectors as the leading emitter of GHGs is expected to 
increase in the future from 73 % of total emissions in the year 2006 to 83 % in the year 2040 according to a 
BAU scenario. Therefore, it is anticipated to focus the mitigation efforts of the Country on this sector. 

The baseline scenarios was based on 2014 conditions, which were deeply relying on imported fossil fuel and 
the delay in renewable and alternative energy projects as well as interruptions in gas supplies. Now, in 2015 
the conditions have changed with more emphasis on renewable and gas. We believe when Jordan develops 
its BUR based on 2010 inventory the baseline scenario will lead to a peak year.

emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but not emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry. Emissions from international 
shipping or bunker fuels are also not included in national figures.

Historically,  Jordan  was  amongst  the  most  active  countries  in  the  region  with  regard  to  involvement  in 
international climate change efforts and response actions. Jordan was amongst the first group of developing 
countries to ratify the UNFCCC and make an accession to the Kyoto Protocol in 1994 and 2003 respectively. In 
response  to  its  obligations  towards  the  UNFCCC,  Jordan  prepared  and  submitted  its  Initial  National 
Communication  on  Climate  Change  in  1997  and  the  Second  National  Communication  in  2009.  Moreover, 
Jordan has launched its Third National Communication Report to UNFCCC in December 2014.  In line with that, 
Jordan  has  systematically  continued  its  efforts  in  responding  to  climate  change  by  developing  and  starting 
implementing national strategies and policies; of which Jordan, supported by UNDP, has developed a national 
climate  change  policy  in  2013,  the  first  comprehensive  policy  in  the  Arab  Region  and  the  Middle  East  as 
elaborated above. 

However, Jordan, as a non-Annex I country, has, so far, no commitments for GHG emission reduction targets. 
Nevertheless,  Jordan  believes  that  there  is  a  large  potential  for  mitigation,  even  though  Jordan's  total  GHG 
emissions are very small in absolute terms  compared to other countries as indicated above. Developing full-
fledged  NAMA  projects  and  capacity  building  in  establishing  and  running  an  effective  MRV  system  both  on 
macro  level and on  sectoral  and  activity  levels  are  highly  needed  since  MRV  is  looked  at  as  prerequisite  for 
developing NAMAs. More dedicated efforts are needed to provide institutional capacity strengthening for data 
collection and management  particularly with  regard  to mitigation.  There  is  good improvement  in  renewable 
energy  policies,  strategies,  laws  and  by-laws  formulation  but  improving  robust  implementations  still  needs 
further  work.  However,  there  is  now  so  much  activities  going  on  renewables  in  the  Country.  Private  sector 
engagement  in  climate  change  activities  is  still  not  at  the  expectation  level  but  slowly  improving  and  good 
progress  is  taking  place  in  investment  in  renewable  energy  sector  particularly.  However,  the  overwhelming 
majority  of  climate  initiatives  and  projects  in  Jordan  are  still  donor-driven.  Thus,  the  pledged  reduction  of 
emissions  by  2030  of  14  %  compared  to  a  BAU  scenario  levels  still  require  substantial  international  financial 
support  and a  paradigm  shift  in  national  planning  that  includes  the  allocation  of  domestic  resources  for  low 
carbon emission growth strategies.  

2.2. Climate change vulnerability of Jordan and impacts 

Climate change is expected to affect sustainable development, economic growth and  society.  Based on outcomes 
from the latest Third National Communication Report to UNFCCC (2014), serious vulnerability and impacts results are 
expected based on modeling and projections analyses. Predicted trends indicated that the annual precipitation tends 
to decrease significantly with time. Simultaneously, the mean, maximum and minimum air temperature tends 
to increase significantly by 0.02, 0.01, and 0.03 °C/year, respectively. On the other hand, the relative humidity 
tends  to  increase  significantly  by  an  average  of  0.08%/year.  In  addition,  the  dynamic  projections  predicted 
more extremely likely heat waves and likely drought events, dry days, and potential evaporation among other 
potential impacts (TNC 2014).  

2.3. Sustainable development challenges in Jordan 

Located  at  the  heart  of  the  Middle  East,  Jordan  is  a  small  upper-middle  income  county  with  scarce  natural 
resources  (in  particular  water),  and  a  small  industrial  base  within  the  service  sector  (the  later  contributes 
around  70%  of  GDP)  which  dominates  the  economy.  The  country  is  shaped  by  its  geography,  history, 
geopolitics and scarcity in natural resources. The government identified poverty and unemployment as two of 
the most important challenges the Country faces. The challenge of meeting the increasing energy demands is 
another pressing issue. Before elaborating on the expected GHGs growth patterns and mitigation potential, it 
is important to present some information about Jordan especially in light of current development challenges 
impacted by economic and regional political situation. 

The  demographic  characteristics  of  the  Jordanian  population  show  that  the  Jordanian  development  process 
faces  a  challenge  in  providing  basic  needs  in  such  a  developing  country.  Jordan  has  a  total  population  of 
approximately  6.388  million.  However,  over  the  past  decade,  Jordan  has  seen  considerable  economic  and 
social achievements; GDP per capita has increased from JD (1512) in 2004 to about JD (3670) in 2014. Jordan 
has also invested significant resources in infrastructure facilities serving the citizens, made remarkable human 
development  achievements,  maintained  stability  and  attracted  foreign  and  domestic  investment.  These 
achievements  were accompanied by  some  challenges that  are  still  unresolved, mainly the development gap 
between governorates, high  unemployment rates, especially among  young people and  the  relative  decline 
in certain competitiveness indicators. However, the general situation in Jordan, the level of infrastructure, and 
the institutional development help Jordan to leap ahead and start addressing and overcoming challenges. His  
Majesty  King Abdullah II has highlighted the most prominent challenges, the way to the future and the social 
and economic model that  the country aspire  in his  letter  to the government to develop a vision for the next 
decade.  

In His Majesty Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein's  Opening Address at the World Economic Forum on the Middle East 
and North Africa, 2015, His Majesty highlighted the importance of securing reliable sources of energy saying 
{quote}  "We  also  need  to  find  the  opportunities  in  challenge.  To  define  our  region  by  problems  and  not

solutions  is  to  miss  huge  potential.  Rapid  urbanization,  education  requirements,  water  scarcity,  the  need  for 
reliable energy, building health and transport infrastructure: these are critical issues for most of our countries.", 
"In Jordan, we are looking to new projects in urban development, water infrastructure, and a diversified, long-
term energy platform" "Today, Jordan is bringing solar heating and lighting to our schools and offices, electric 
vehicles to our streets and industries, a digital system for our health sector, e-payments for transactions, even 
iris recognition for channeling assistance to refugees. These are just a few examples. You at this Forum, and 
your peers in the region, will create many, many more." {end quotes} 

The  high  annual  growth  rates  of  demand  for  energy  (4-5%  for  primary  energy  and  5.3%  for  demand  for 
electricity) for the period 2015-2025 remains one of the highest in the world and thus is considered one of 
the  Kingdom's  most  significant  development  challenges.  In 2013,  total  primary  energy  consumed  in  Jordan 
was about 8.2 million tons of oil equivalent, 82% of which were crude oil and oil derivatives, 11% natural gas, 
3% renewable energy and imported electricity and 4% petroleum coke and coal. The national energy sector's 
main  concern  is  the  provision  of  adequate  energy  for  development  with  the  least  possible  cost  and  best 
quality.  The  energy  sector  still  suffers  from  extreme  fluctuations  of  oil  prices  and  the  ability  to  secure 
constant and sustainable energy supply for the country.  

While  Jordan  has  achieved  many  sustainable  development  goals,  sustaining  these  results  and  reducing  the 
burden of the energy sector on economic and social development will increasingly depend on the transition 
to a sustainable energy future. The high cost of importing energy puts a heavy burden on the public  budget 
already  constrained  by  running  costs.  Since  the  prices  of  energy  imports  have  increased  with  high  risk  in 
constant  supplies,  this  situation  spurred  governmental  action  to  improve  energy  efficiency  and  provide 
additional  energy  resources.  The  running  policy  of  the  GoJ  in  the  field  of  energy  was  shaped  through  the 
adoption  of  the  Updated  Master  Strategy  of  Energy  Sector  in  Jordan  for  the  period  2007-2020.  The  main 
goals  of  the  Strategy  are  to  secure  reliable  energy  supply  through  increasing  the  share  of  local  energy 
resources such as oil shale, natural gas in the energy mix, expanding the development of renewable energy 
projects, promoting energy conservation and energy efficiency and awareness and generating electricity from 
nuclear  energy.  The  options  include  as  will  a  diversification  of  Liquefied  Natural  Gas  (LNG)  possibly  from 
Qatar or the new Leviathan Basin in the Eastern Mediterranean (thus, a new LNG port is already operational 
in Aqaba); new oil and gas pipelines from Iraq; and search for new shale potentials. 

The running energy strategy is to transform the energy mix from one heavily reliant on oil and natural gas to 
one  more  balanced  with  a  higher  proportion  of  energy  supplied  by  oil  shale  and  renewable  sources.  The 
energy strategy sought to increase reliance on local energy sources to 25 % by 2015, and up to 39 % by 2020 
as set in 2020 Energy Strategy. Placing more emphasis on the utilization of renewable energies will alleviate 
the  dependency  on  the  traditional  energy  sources,  especially  oil,  which  is  imported  from  neighboring 
countries.  This  will also  be  paralleled with  the  reduction  of  energy  produced from  oil  from  82%  in  2013  to 
reach 50% in 2020. 

The  2013  Arab  Future  Energy  Index  (AFEX)  showed  that  Jordan  has  made  progress  in  this  regard,  ranking 
second in the Arab region for renewable energy trends and the second for energy efficiency. The 2012 Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy Law no. 13 is also a key enabler, providing incentives for sustainable energy 
solutions as Jordan seeks to increase renewable energy from 2% of overall energy in 2013 to 10 % in 2020, 
and to improve energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020.  

The influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan has increased the demand for energy and electricity. In addition to 
long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand as well as management, 
Jordan also faces exacerbating factors resulting from the increase of Syrian refugees, who comprise nearly 13 
% of Jordan's 6.388 million  population. Although Syrian refugees and forced  migrants fall within  the  lower-
income bracket and  average energy consumptions remain less impactful on the  broad energy  challenges  in 
Jordan  relative  to  core  energy  users  in  the  Country,  total  residential  energy  consumption  has  risen 
significantly. 

From  another  corner,  the  development  of  industrial  and  services  sectors  in  Jordan,  accompanied  with  the 
increase of Jordanian population and the increase of numbers of vehicles has resulted in an increase in the 
GHGs  and  pollution  emitted  to  the  ambient  air  in  the  last  decades.  Transport  sector  in  Jordan  is  a  major 
contributor to increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. With a percentage of 16% of emissions share to the 
bulk  GHGs  of  Jordan,  transport  sector  is  the  second  source  (after  energy  sector  emitting  28%)  of  GHGs 
emissions  in  the  country.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  (MoT)  launched  a  long-term  national  strategy  2014  in 
which  the  sustainable  transport  is  one  of  its  pillars.  Mobility  of  people  and  freight  is  a  widely  shared  goal 
amongst  transport  policy  makers  in  Jordan;  therefore,  the  MoT  is  obliged  to  form  its  policies  in  line  with 
sustainable  transport  trend.  One  of  the  major  objectives  of  the  long-term  transport  strategy  at  MoT  is  to 
increase the total number of commuters using public transport as a percentage of the total number. In 2010 
this  percentage  stood  at  13  percent,  9  of  which  were  taxies.  It  is  anticipated  that  this  percentage  would 
increase by implementing programs and projects that will enhance the quality of service of the whole public 

 

4 

transit network to 25 percent by 2025.  

 

 

The environmental sustainability of Jordan's transport strategies are focused on three main aspects, namely 
emissions,  energy  consumption,  and  traffic  reduction.  MoT  believes  it  is  important  to  reduce  all  emissions 
from  transport  sector  (i.e.  CO2,  CO,  PMx,  NOx  expressed  in  tons  per  day).  MoT  will  also  work  on  reducing 
percentage  of  fuel  consumption  (in  tons  per  day)  which  might  be  achieved  through  the  implementation of 
the  transport  strategy.  With  regard  to  traffic  reduction,  Mot  will  work  on  this  contribution  in  terms  of 
reduction of V-km at national level and in densely populated areas by type of vehicle (i.e. car, HGV, LGV and 
expressed  in  1000v-km  per  day).  MoT  believes  that  introducing  higher  order  public  transit  systems  such  as 
bus rapid transit (BRT) systems is key to improving the transport service in the country. MoT is already taking 
on  the  Zarqa-  Amman  project  that  would  link  to  the  Amman  BRT  system  that  is  being  implemented.  Initial 
steps are being taken to tackle other probable viable routs including Salt- Sweileh- Baqaa. 

Serious measures are being taken to implement the national railway system, which would be a cornerstone 
of the planned multimodal network that would play a major role in the ease of the transport of goods within 
the country and the surrounding region. With such system in place, the reductions of emissions from these 
activities  are  obvious.  MoT  believes  that  utilizing  latest  technology  in  the  transit  sector  can  add  to  the 
efficiency of operations; implementing applications that connect taxies to customers for instance can reduce 
idle  time  thus  reducing  energy  usage  thereby  reducing  emissions.  Acquiring  accurate  data  for  origin  and 
destination of passengers can pave the way for better rout planning, thereby increasing the ride ability and 
shortening  trip  distances.  Moreover,  MoT  is  targeting  to  increase  transport  sector  ridability.  Adopting  and 
implementing  policies  related  to  fleet  characteristics  would  also  enhance  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions. 
Issues  related  to  fleet  service  life,  replacement  incentives,  and  reconfiguration  of  technical  elements  will 
have a positive effect on energy consumptions and reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions. 

2.4. Demographic, economic and political challenges 

One of the main demographic and thus political determinants for Jordan and thus development implications 
is  migration.  Being  at  the  crossroads  of  two  major  areas  of  instability  and  prolonged  conflicts,  Jordan  has 
become the destination for several waves of forced  migrants from  Palestine and lately from  Iraq and  Syria. 
Since 2011, and until February 2015 Jordan has hosted over 650,000 refugees from Syria, with approximately 
three-quarters  living  in  urban  areas  across  the  Country  and  one-quarter  living  in  refugee  camps  in  the 
northern region. The waves of refugee influxes are still on going, as the conflict has no foreseeable solution. 
Based  on  data  from  Department  of  Statistics  (DOS)  obtained  at  the  end  of  2014,  the  total  number  of 
unregistered Syrian people in Jordan is 750,000 people while the registered number with UNHCR is 650,000. 
The grand total number of Syrian in Jordan is 1.4 million persons. 

Jordan  has  been  affected  by  not  only  the  adverse  regional  and  global  developments  such  as  the  political 
situations  in  the  area  but  also  by  the  continuing  global  financial  and  economic  crises  as  well  as  the  rise  in 
commodity  prices  in  the  international  markets.  The  rapid  growths  in  economic  activities,  population  and 
successive influxes of refugees over the last decade have imposed additional demands on energy resources. 
As matter of fact, Jordan is a country with limited indigenous energy resources. Jordan imports about 97% of 
its energy requirements, which includes mainly crude oil, oil derivatives and natural gas. Local sources cover 
the  remaining  3%  of  requirements  with  renewable  energy  contributing  only  a  small  proportion  to  this 
mixture. This 97% import of energy needs is accounting for almost 20% of the GDP, which makes the country 
completely reliable on and vulnerable to the global energy market.  

2.5. A future sustainable development vision in favor of low-carbon economy 

Recently, the GOJ launched in mid of 2015 Jordan's 2025 National Visions and Strategy, which charts a path 
for the future and determines the integrated economic and social framework that will govern the economic 
and social policies based on providing  opportunities for all. Jordan 2025 includes more than 400 policies  or 
procedures  with  performance  indicators  (including  energy,  water,  waste,  agriculture  and  other  mitigation-
oriented  sectoral  policies,  procedures  and  indicators)  which  will  lead  to  reduction  of  GHGs  that  will  be 
implemented  through  a  participatory  approach  between  the  government,  business  sector  and  civil  society. 
Most  importantly,  the  2025  National  Vision  and  Strategy  has  set  a  11%  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPIs)-
style  "targets"  for  renewable  energy  share  in  the  total  energy  mix  in  2025  as  well  as  increasing  the 
percentage of  the  contribution of  natural gas  in  the  energy  mix to 39%. Quoted from the Vision, "There 
is  no  doubt  that  given  the  current  financial  pressures  on  our  economy  and  its  people  and  the  elevated  and 
continuing  level  of  insecurity  and  conflict  in  our  region,  Vision  2025  is  ambitious."  Jordan  is  a  small  open 
economy with population growth rate much higher than the global average. Therefore, due to the small size 
of  our  local  economy,  it  is  difficult  to  deliver  high-quality  sustainable  growth  and  create  the  number  and 
quality  of  jobs  needed  to  employ  Jordanians  over  the  next  decade  and  beyond.  Although  we  have  made

significant progress over the past decade, significant challenges lie ahead as we seek to achieve greater and 
better quality prosperity for all Jordanians.

Jordan's Mitigation Contribution 

3.1. Mitigation outcomes 

  Jordan has set a KPI-style "target" of 11% of renewable energy share in the total energy mix in 2025. 

This KPI is articulated in Jordan 2025-A National Vision and Strategy (launched June 2015). 

  The unconditional GHGs reduction outcome target is aiming at reducing Jordan's GHGs by at maximum 
1.5 % by 2030 compared to a business as usual scenario levels. This target will be arrived at based on 
implementing  tens  of  projects,  some  of  them  are  part  of  the  43  sectoral  projects  resulted  from  the 
mitigation  scenario  assessment  articulated  in  the  Third  National  Communication  (TNC)  Report  to 
UNFCCC and some are priority projects proposed recently by GHGs emission sectors after developing the 
TNC and communicated to MoEnv. The implementation of some of these projects already started. 

  The conditional outcome target is aiming at reducing Jordan's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 12.5 
% by 2030. This target as well will be arrived at based on implementing tens of projects, some of them 
are  part  of  the  43  sectoral  projects  proposed  in  the  TNC  Report  to  UNFCCC  and  some  are  priority 
projects  proposed  recently  by  GHGs  emission  sectors  after  developing  the  TNC  and  communicated  to 
MoEnv. The implementation of some of these projects already started.  

The estimated cost to reach the 14% target is totaling USD 5,700,000,000 from which GoJ has already secured 
USD 542,750,000 by its own means to meet the unconditional target, which means the Country is in need of 
USD 5,157,250,000 to fulfill its conditional target. 

3.2. Mitigation actions 

National-level actions 

  Developing  the  National  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  for  Transitioning  towards  the  Green  Economy  in 
Jordan  2016-2025.  This  activity  is  currently  under  execution  and  the  green  growth  strategy  is 
expected to be developed in 2016. 

Sectoral actions 

i.  Energy Sector 

  Developing  and  utilizing  the  local  conventional  and  renewable  sources  of  energy  (expanding  the 
development of renewable energy projects) and encouraging investment in renewable energy: Raising 
awareness  about  the  incentives  provided  by  the  renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  law; 
improving the attractiveness of renewable electricity tariff by basing the purchase price on the cost 
of production (depending on the energy source and size of  the project); encouraging and supporting 
local  industries  to  manufacture  renewable  energy  components;  implementing  the  power  purchase 
agreements  on  the  long-term  from  renewable  energy  producers;  and  activating  the  recently 
established Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (JREEEF). 

  Encouraging the use of solar energy for water heating: through the provision of short-term support 

for the purchase of solar water heaters. 

  Requiring  the  implementation  of  green  building  codes:  by  setting  clear  standards  for  construction, 
materials  and  land  based  on  best  practices;  and  requiring  all  new  buildings  in  the  public  sector  to 
comply with Leadership In Energy & Environmental Design (LEED). 

  Rationalizing energy consumption in all sectors and improving their efficiency and raising awareness 
about the long-term financial benefits of energy efficiency: Improving the collection of data on energy 
use patterns and identifying the most useful data on the efficiency of energy use for policy makers; 
providing  appropriate  financial  incentives  for  energy  efficiency  projects;  and  providing  funding  to 
allow  schools,  hospitals  and  other  facilities  assessing  the  potential  of  saving  energy,  and  making 
energy-related capital improvements in their facilities. Implementing programs of energy audits and 
energy efficiency measures in public and governmental buildings; conducting awareness campaign to 
promote  solar  water  heaters  in  different  sectors  and  awareness  campaigns  to  promote  energy 
efficiency through energy audit; and establishing In-House Show Room in the Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources (MEMR's) premises to advise public people including professionals in how to save 
energy in all aspects. 

  Attracting private sector investment to the energy sector: Reducing administrative obstacles in order 

to take advantage of the JREEEF to support investment in early stage. 

  Diversifying the sources and kinds of energy and diversifying sources of natural gas imports: Ensuring 

 

6 

 

 

safe  and  flexible  gas  deals  in  the  short,  medium  and  long-terms  and  finding  additional  sources  of 
natural  gas  to supply  industries and distribution projects  in  cities (KPI-style "target"  of 39% natural 
gas in the energy mix in 2025). 

  Expanding  the  use  of  solar  cooling  in  commercial  and  industrial  facilities:  Jordan  has  been 
experimenting  the  application  of  solar  cooling  technologies  for  use  in  commercial  buildings  and 
industrial  process  to  help  in  introducing  sustainable  energy  systems  and  reducing  GHG  emissions 
from  the cooling sector.  Successful  attempts have been documented and the country  is now ready 
for an expanded and upscale introduction of solar cooling technologies.   

ii.  Transport Sector 

iii.  Transport is by far the largest energy consumer in the Kingdom and the second emitter   of GHG according to 

the 3rd  National Communication Report. Main programmes and projects under transport sectors are:  

 

  Launching the MoT's long term national transport strategy in 2014 in which the sustainable transport 

is one of its pillars; 

  Increasing the total number of commuters using public transport as a percentage of the total number 

to 25 % by 2025; 

  Introduction  of  the  Zero  Emission  Electric  Vehicle  (ZEV)  in  Jordan  will  be  implemented  in  various 
phases  with  the  eventual  deployment  of  3000  charging  stations  (  on  grid  &  off  grid)  by  to  support 
 10000 ZEVs by the private sector. The ZEV charging stations will be powered by renewable energy. The 
programme will be implemented through a partnership between the Greater Amman Municipality and 
the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  the  private  sector  within  a  Public  Private  Partnership  (PPP) 
agreement.  The  outcomes  of  the  initial phase  will  guide  the  upscaling of  this programme  in  a wider 
context that goes beyond 2020. The Jordanian government in coordination with the private sector will 
develop the supporting legislation needed to ensure a secure and transparent introduction of the ZEV 
in the kingdom. 

  Reducing all emissions from transport sector (i.e. CO2, CO, PMx, NOx expressed in tons per day); 
  Reducing percentage of fuel consumption (in tons per day) achieved through the implementation of 

the transport strategy; 

  V-km reduction at national level and in densely populated areas by type of vehicle (i.e. car, HGV, LGV 

and expressed in 1000v-km per day); 

  Implementing the national BRT system; 
  Implementing the railway system, which would be a cornerstone of the planned multimodal network 
that  would  play  a  major  role  in  the  ease  of  the  transport  of  goods  within  the  country  and  the 
surrounding region. With such system in place,  the reductions of emissions from these activities are 
obvious; 

  Increasing  transport  sector  ridability  through  adopting  and  implementing  policies  related  to  fleet 
characteristics  to  enhance  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions  thus  yielding  positive  effect  on  energy 
consumptions and reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions; 

  Ensuring the inclusion of energy efficiency considerations when buying transport modals. 

iv.  Waste Management Sector 

  Developing a  system  for  sorting,  re-using and  recycling  (KPI-style  "target"    to  reduce  percentage  of 
solid  waste  that  is  disposed  of  in  landfills  from  80%  to  60%  in  2025  and  increasing  percentage  of 
treated  and re-used  solid waste from 20% to 40% in 2025. 

v.  Industries Sector 

  Encouraging investment in solar and wind energy projects near industrial clusters; 
  Providing alternative energy sources and motivating local industry to use  alternative energy  sources; 
  Implementing  comprehensive  programs  for  renewable  energy  and  rationalizing  energy  through 
JREEEF,  to  include  the  provision  of  technical  and  financial  support  windows  for  programs  and 
projects  such  as  Revolving  Fund,  Equity  Finance,  Guarantees,  and  Grants  to  various    sectors,   
including  residential sector,  as   well   as   managing   and    organizing comprehensive awareness 
campaigns for renewable energy and energy efficiency . 

vi.  Water Sector 

 

7 

 

 

  Improving energy use efficiency in water utilities, and implementing a number of  projects based on 
renewable energy  sources (hydropower, solar, wind)  as well as biogas and energy production from 
sludge (KPI-style "target" to reduce energy used per billed cubic meter (billed kW/m3) from 4.175 in 
base year 2013 to 4.065 in 2015). 

  Developing  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Irrigation's  (MWI)  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy 
Policy for the Jordanian Water Sector (2015) starting with utilization of sludge and other biosolids to 
generate  energy,  which  is  one  of  several  projects  announced  under  the  policy,  which  seeks  to 
achieve  a  15  %  reduction  in  energy  consumption  of  billed  water  by  the  year  2025  through  the 
introduction of economically feasible and environment-friendly power generation systems based on 
renewable energy sources. 

  Introducing renewable energy as a source to supply water systems. 

vii.  Agriculture and Food Security Sector 

  Afforesting  25%  of  barren forest  areas  in  the  rain  belt  areas  on  which  the  rate  of  precipitation 

exceeds 300 mm. 

3.3. Up-front Information 

3.3.1.  Quantifiable information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year): 

Baseline scenario/base year: A Business as usual scenario was used (but 2006 was used as a base year for GHG 
inventory in the TNC upon which the core component of Jordan's INDCs were based). 

Emissions in base year: 28.72.3 million ton (Mt) of CO2 equivalent (a sectoral breakdown of emissions shares 
per surveyed sectors is provided in Figure 1 above but a detailed sub-sectoral and gas type breakdowns of the 
GHGs are provided in the TNC Report and the accompanying inventory submitted to UNFCCC in late 2014). 

3.3.2.  Time frames and/or periods for implementation  

Time frame of  the commitment is  until  end  of  2030.  The  quantified commitment by 2030 is  relevant  to  the 
GHGs  reduction  targets  while  the  other  packages  of  mitigation  actions  (and  tied  KPI-based  targets)  are 
anticipated  to  be  achieved  by  2025  based  on  timeframe  adopted  by  Jordan  2025-a  National  Vision  and 
Strategy (launched in 2015).  

3.3.3. Scope and coverage 

Gases  covered:  Carbon  dioxide  (CO2);  Methane  (CH4);  Nitrous  oxide  (N2O);  Sulphur  hexafluoride  (SF6); 

Perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). 

Base year for gases covered: all 2006. 

Sectors covered: energy (including transport), waste, industrial processes, agriculture and land-use, land-use change and 

forestry (LULUCF) and solvents. 

Furthermore, GHG emissions from bunker fuels have also been estimated and reported as a memo item (these 
emissions  are  not  included  in  the  national  GHGs  inventory  total).  In  addition  to  the  sectoral  approach,  the 
reference approach has also been used for the estimation of CO2 emissions from the overall fuel consumption 
figures for the time frame between 2000-2010. 

3.3.4. Planning processes and tracking of progress 

Short-term 

Jordan's  well  organized  and  institutionalized  planning  process  for  combating  climate  change  has  started  in  2013  by 
voluntarily developing the National Climate Change Policy for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 2013-2020 as 
mentioned  before.  The  provisions  of  this  Climate  Change  Policy  are  being  integrated/mainstreamed  in 
environmental, social and economic policies and legislation in the Country. In particular, the Policy's provision 
will be integrated in the National Green Growth Plan and Implementation Roadmap, which is currently under 
development and will be launched in 2016 and will cover six sectors (energy, water, waste, transport, tourism 
and agriculture). The INDC proposed for Jordan is envisioned as the core element of the said National Green 
Growth Plan. This helps dual implementation of the INDCs and the Country's green growth plan. 

The National Committee on Climate Change is mandated to monitor the progress in the implementation of the 
Climate Change Policy on the national level and thus the INDC. A large share of the objectives of the Policy will 
be  implemented  through  sector  strategies  under  the  responsibility  of  the  sector's  ministries  (energy,  water, 
agriculture, health, and others). Their progress will be monitored by each involved sector on the basis of the 
specific monitoring framework adopted in the respective sector's policies and strategies. 

Medium- to long-terms 

 

8 

 

 

The national implementation will be based on the time frame of the commitments, which is until end of 2030 
for the GHGs reduction targets and until 2025 for the other packages of mitigation actions (and tied KPI-based 
targets) based on timeframe adopted by Jordan 2025 Vision. The GHGs reduction targets' achievement will be 
tracked  through  the  information  in  Jordan's  national  inventories  and  Biennial  Update  Report  (BURs).  The 
preparation of the first BUR for Jordan will start in 2016 and is expected to be completed in late 2017. Jordan 
will strive to put in place a functioning MRV system for GHG inventory and  mitigation progress based in the 
appropriate institutional and technological settings available. For the other packages of mitigation actions (and 
tied KPI-based targets) proposed in Jordan 2025, the Vision has set a "Performance Management Framework 
for Implementation" to assure that the policies, measures, and KPIs articulated in the  Vision will be fulfilled. 
In  each  section  of  the  2020  Vision,  a  number  of  KPIs  have  been  chosen  to  measure  progress,  and  where 
possible,  objective  and  internationally  used  KPIs  have  been  selected.  This  is  to  ensure  transparency  in 
measuring  progress.  The  governmental  executive  programs  that  will  be  prepared  based  on  this  Vision  will 
measure  progress  in  the  short  and  medium  terms.  The  time-period  covered  by  the  Vision  was  divided  into 
three phases, and each phase will be evaluated to see what has, and what has not been, achieved in order to 
ensure  continuing  the  implementation  of  policies  and  initiatives  of  the  said  Vision.  The  Prime  Minister's 
Delivery  Unit  was  re-established  to  follow  up  the  most  important  initiatives  proposed  and  overcome  the 
obstacles facing the Vision's implementation in order to assure commitment and effective implementation. 
3.3.5.  Assumptions and methodological approaches including those for estimating and accounting for 

anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals 

The  INDCs  of  Jordan  are  based  on  the  following  methodologies  and  assumptions  and  methodological 
approaches: 

As  a  non-Annex  I  country,  the  inventory  information  provided  by  Jordan  is  according  to  the  guidelines  for 
Parties not included in Annex I as required by decision 17/CP.8. The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 1997) have been used. In addition, and as encouraged by decision 17/CP.8, 
the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Inventory (IPCC 2000) 
and the IPCC Good Practice Guidance on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (IPCC 2003) have also been 
used specially in the uncertainty estimation. The UNFCCC software for Non-Annex I countries has been used 
for the preparation of the national inventory. Sectoral (bottom-up) approach has been used to estimate the 
GHG emissions and removals from the following sectors: 

• Primary energy, 
• Renewable energy, 
• Energy efficiency, 
• Transport, 
• Industrial processes, 
• Waste, and 
• Agriculture 

Furthermore, GHG emissions from bunker fuels have also been estimated and reported as a memo item (these 
emissions are not included in the national total). In addition to the sectoral approach, the reference approach 
has also been used for the estimation of CO2 emissions from the overall fuel consumption figures for the time 
frame between 2000-2010. The direct GHGs whose emissions have been estimated in this national inventory 
are:  

• Carbon dioxide (CO2); 
• Methane (CH4); 
• Nitrous oxide (N2O); 
• Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6); 
• Perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and 
• Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 

Emissions of the following indirect GHGs also have been estimated and reported in this inventory: 

• Oxides of nitrogen (NOx); 
• Carbon monoxide (CO); 
• Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC); and 
• Sulphur dioxide (SO2). 

However, as the indirect GHGs have not been allocated global warming potential, they are not included within 
Jordan's  aggregate  emissions.  In  the  current  inventory,  tier  one  method  has  been  used  except  for  the 
estimation of emissions from domestic and international aviation where tier two methods was used based on 
the number of landing and take-off (LTOs), types of aircrafts and total fuel consumption and for the agriculture 
sector tier two was used for the first time. For the energy sector, available emission factors were used when 
applicable (a summary of GHGs breakdown for Jordan per sectors are illustrated in Figure 1 above).  

 

9 

 

 

The 43 GHG mitigation projects proposed in the mitigation scenario in the TNC covers the seven sectoral areas 
mentioned  above.  The  cost,  benefits  and  CO2  emission  reduction  were  analyzed  for  each  proposed  43 
mitigation projects in the TNC. Net present value method was used in the financial calculations, by converting 
all of the future revenues and costs over the period of the project based on today's cost. The same approach 
was utilized when calculating CO2 emission reductions over the lifetime of the proposed projects. A discount 
rate of 8 % was used in all calculations. The discounted unit cost of reduced emissions is the quotient of the 
discounted  net  cash  flow  to  the  discounted  emission  reductions.  If  the  analyzed  mitigation  projects  are 
executed,  they  will  lead  to  annual  reductions  of  3538  Gg  in  the  year  2020;  and  are  expected  to  increase  to 
5176 Gg  in  the  year  2030, which  represents  around  9%  of  baseline emissions.  Based  on the  unit  abatement 
cost and abatement marginal cost curve, the most feasible options seem to be linked with the energy projects 
in general (energy efficiency and renewable energy projects with unit cost range from -13 to -274 JD/t CO2).  

3.3.6. How Jordan considers that its intended nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious, 

in light of its national circumstances 

Taking  into  consideration  that  global  efforts  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  must  be  differentiated 
according  to  a  Party's  responsibility  and  capability,  Jordan  believes  that  its  very  diversified  INDC  (a 
combination  of  a  wide  rainbow  of  outcomes  and  actions)  set  together  an  ambitious  target  relevance  to  its 
small  amount  of  GHGs  emission  share  and  development  circumstances.  The  Country's  bulk  share  of  GHGs 
represents only around 0.06% of global total according to a global GHGs analysis conducted in 2010. According to 
the World Bank, the CO2 metric tons per capita emission is 3.4 in 2010 as said before. Nevertheless, this small share 
of GHG did not justify a reluctant reaction of the Country. To the contrary, Jordan, historically, was amongst 
the most active countries in the region with regard to involvement in international climate change efforts and 
engagement  in  response  actions  as  explained  above.  Most  importantly,  Jordan  has  voluntarily  developed  a 
national climate change policy in 2013, the first comprehensive policy in the Arab Region and the Middle East. 
In  fact,  Jordan willingly  developed the National  Climate  Change  Policy for  the  Hashemite  Kingdom of  Jordan 
2013-2020. This policy is considered the first national-level comprehensive planning initiative to deal with the 
global phenomenon of climate change in a holistic approach in the Country. However, Jordan, as any of non-
Annex  I  countries,  has,  so  far,  no  commitments  for  GHG  emission  reduction  targets.  Nevertheless,  Jordan 
believes that there is a large potential for mitigation, eventhough Jordan's total GHG emissions are very small 
in absolute terms, and compared to other countries as indicated above. 

From another angle, the modest income levels of the Country along with development challenges described 
above, mainly poverty and unemployment as two of the most important challenges the Country  faces as well 
as  limitation  in  natural  resources  and  energy  challenges  along  with  the  demographic  characteristics  of  the 
Jordanian  population  all  show  that  the  Jordanian  development  process  faces  a  big  challenge  in  providing 
basic needs in such a developing country. Moreover, the rapid growths in economic activities, population and 
successive influxes of refugees over the last decade have imposed additional demands on energy resources. 
While  Jordan  has  achieved  many  sustainable  development  goals,  sustaining  these  results  and  reducing  the 
burden  of  the  energy    sector    on    economic    and    social    development  will  increasingly  depend  on  the 
transition to a sustainable energy future. The high cost of importing energy puts a heavy burden on the public 
budget already constrained by running costs. There is no doubt that given the current financial pressures on 
our economy and its people and the elevated and continuing level of insecurity and conflict in our region, the 
INDC of Jordan specially those presented in the Vision 2025 are all fair and ambitious. 
 

3.3.7.  How Jordan's INDC contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in 

its Article 2 

Compared to its very small share of GHGs, Jordan's very diverse spectrum of actions and outcomes of commitment 
with emphasis on those aiming at reducing its emissions by 14 % by 2030 relative to a business as usual levels puts 
this small country on a low carbon development track that is in line with the recommendations of the IPCC AR5 
to  reduce  global  emissions  by  minus  40  to  70  percent  by  2050  below  2010  levels.    The  diverse  package  of 
national climate change legal documents, climate change-aligned sectoral strategies and policies and related 
action  plans,  the  vigorously  accelerated  number  of  GHGs  cut-oriented  projects  being  developed  in  many 
sectors  and  the  development  of  Energy  Services  Company  (ESCOs),  for  which  legislative  and    regulatory 
framework as well as certification mechanism are under development to organize their operations,  all reflect 
the seriousness of the country in combating climate change and increasing the level of involvement in carbon 
market  business.    For  such  a  small  country,  this  huge  number  of  GHGs  reduction-oriented  activities  and 
projects will absolutely contribute towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2.  

4.  Jordan's Adaptation Actions 

Current status of vulnerability and potential impact in relevant sectors as well as proposed sectoral strategic objectives, 
measures,  and  instruments  to  adapt  to  climate  change  impacts  were  advanced  in  the  Climate  Change  Policy  of 
Hashemite  Kingdom  of  Jordan  2013-2020  for  each  involved  sector  (water,  coastal  areas,  agriculture/food  security, 

10 

 

 

 

health,  tourism,  biodiversity,  and  socioeconomic  situation/poverty).  These  strategic  objectives,  measures,  and 
instruments  will  be  revised  and  augmented  accordingly  later  on  in  the  coming  few  years  to  address  post-2020  era 
(most probably up to 2030). 

Example  of  other  pre-2020  adaptation  activities  of  the  Country  are:  integrating  climate  change  adaptation  during 
aligning the National Strategy and Action Plan to Combat Desertification (2015-2020) with the UNCCD 10-Year 
Strategy as well aligning the Country's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2020) with the CBD 
10-Year Strategy. 

The cost of implementing the adaptation measures proposed to involved sectors were not estimated in the national 
Climate  Change  Policy.  Thus,  involved  line  ministries  and  NGOs  were  approached  in  2015  by  official  letters  sent 
through MoEnv requesting such institutions to provide a list of priority adaptation actions for post-20202 era on the 
top of those proposed in the 2013-2020 Policy, including estimated cost of such measures (already secured funds and 
anticipated  funds).  In  light  of  responses  received  by  MoEnv,  the  following  section  lists  such  envisioned  adaptation 
actions and information. 

4.1. Water sector's adaptation actions 

It  is  highly  evident  that  water  resources  in  Jordan  are  very  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  Previous  strategic 
studies  and  legal  documents  (i.e.  Jordan's  Second  Communication  Report  to  UNFCCC    (2009)  and  National 
Climate Change Policy (2013), and the latest TNC (2014)) all have identified that scarcity of water resources is  
one of the major barriers facing sustainable development in Jordan that will be further magnified by climate 
change. Expected reduced precipitation, maximum temperature increase, drought/dry days and evaporation 
are the main determinants of climate change hazards. The impact of the increased evaporation and decreased 
rainfall  will  result  in  less  recharge  and  therefore  less  replenishment  of  surface  water  and  groundwater 
reserves.  In  the  long  term,  this  impact  will  extend  to  cause  serious  soil  degradation  that  could  lead  to 
desertification,  exacerbating  future  conditions  and  worsening  the  situation  of  the  agricultural  sector  due  to 
the lack of sufficient water that will affect the income of the agriculture sectors. Low income will ultimately 
reduce the ability to the adaptation to climate change with families unable to respond to the pressing needs 
for  replacing  traditional  water  supplies  with  new  methods  that  require  more  spending  (purchasing  drinking 
water  from  tanks).  In  addition  to  climate  change,  the  increased  demand  for  water  in  Jordan  during  the  last 
decade has contributed significantly to reducing per capita shares. The natural growth of economic activities 
and  population  increase  have  been  exacerbated  by  the  continuous  flow  of  refugees  from  Syria  in  particular 
and thus increase the demand for water. 
One of the major pre 2020 studies Jordan conducted in the field of water (and health) sectors' adaptation was 
from  2009  to  2013  namely  "Adaptation  to  Climate  Change  to  Sustain  Jordan's  MDG  Achievements".  The 
study's goals were to developing sustained access to improved water supply sources, despite increasing water 
scarcity due to climate change and to strengthening the capacity for health protection and food security under 
conditions of water scarcity. The main adaptation knowledge products of the said project were: 

—  Water Safety Plans (WSPs) as a risk management approach to protecting drinking water safety in five pilot 

areas; 

—  Critical laboratory equipment was procured and installed in the Ministry of Health's (MoH) water testing 

labs;  

—  The capacity to adapt to climate change in the area of food security was strengthened through the 

identification and dissemination of climate resilient techniques; 

—  A model farm reusing treated wastewater was created for use as a training and demonstration center; 
—  Piloted interventions for showcasing, awareness campaigns targeting stakeholders at different levels, and 

training programmes enhanced the capacities of local communities, youths, decision makers and 
professionals in this regard. This included the establishment of the International Center for Water and 
Environmental Research at Al Balqa Applied University; 

—  Health vulnerability assessments and a national adaptation strategy and plans of actions for health 

protection from climate change were conducted in six critical areas: heat waves, nutrition, water and 
food-borne disease, vector-borne disease, occupational health and air-borne and respiratory diseases; 
—  Capacity to adapt to climate change was strengthened in the Zarqa River Basin (ZRB), where extensive 

studies were conducted to assess and model climate change impacts on water quality and availability as 
well as to identify adaptation measures addressing these impacts. 
 

Other water adaptation projects implemented in Jordan in partnership with the MoEnv's key partners, mainly 
IUCN, were: 

*  The Regional Knowledge Network on Water (R-KNOW) implemented through Regional Knowledge 

Network on Systemic Approaches to Water Resources Management project (2011-2015). The project 

 

11 

 

 

aspired to create a Regional Knowledge Network on Water that will assist in strengthening the application 
of systematic approaches to water management and structured around the following thematic areas: 
—  Water and climate change. 
—  Water governance. 
—  Water, food and energy nexus. 
—  Sustainable water technologies. 

*  SWIM-Sustain Water MED project: It is one of the demonstration projects within the SWIM umbrella and 

addressed sustainable wastewater and sanitation management in the MENA region. The project was 
implemented from 2012- 2015. It operated in four countries including Jordan. Each of the demonstration 
projects addressed a different aspect pertaining to wastewater treatment and reuse as well as rainwater 
management to demonstrate effective and cost- efficient wastewater treatment and reuse technologies 
through pilot projects. 

*  Water-DROP Project: aimed at developing an Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach 
at the Mediterranean Basin level for managing the related cross-sector issues through the enforcement of 
multi-stakeholder partnerships, in particular with public and private actors. The project as well 
implemented 35 rain water harvesting cisterns for the rural community and schools in Balqa Governorate   
in order to harvest the water from the roofs. 

The downscaled climate data on Jordan in general and on the pilot study area assessed in the TNC (2014) in 
particular  suggest  that  the  long-term  temperature  and  precipitation  averages,  for  the  periods  2020-2050; 
2040-2070; 2060-2100 show a slight increase in temperature with slight decrease in precipitation. Thus, the 
following summarizes the adaptation policies and measures proposed in the Water Sector in the TNC (2014) 
on the top of the strategic objectives and measures advanced previously in the National Climate Change Policy 
of Jordan (2013). Nearly all the low cost options for the development of new water resources are challenging 
in Jordan. Since all rivers and aquifers are highly exploited, few options are left for developing new sources of 
water for drinking and irrigation 

 

Adaptation measures & programs for the water sector include the following: 

Residential water supply: 

—  Reducing water losses in distribution pipes; 
—  Introducing water metering; 
—  Introducing water saving technologies such as low-flow  toilets and showers, and efficient appliances; 
—  Collection of rainwater for gardens, toilets, and other applications; 
—  Promoting water saving by awareness campaigns. 

Irrigation: 

—  Introducing water saving technologies in irrigation  schemes such as drip, micro-spray, and night 

irrigation, etc; 

—  Introducing new varieties of crops that use less water and are salt-tolerant; 
—  Increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems; 
—  Reforming water pricing; 
—  Using groundwater more efficiently. 

Water quality: 

—  Improving wastewater treatment plants (WWTP); 
—  Recycling wastewater; 
—  Developing river protection and sanitation zones; 
—  Improving chemical and biological monitoring. 

Socio-economic issues: 

—  Training people of different ages and social statuses on water saving and sanitation methods; 
—  Increasing public awareness to water related issues; 
—  Introducing water cleaning and softening technology; 
—  Introducing policy measures to ensure the equity in access to water; 
—  Carrying out studies to estimate the impacts of hydrological disasters such as flash floods and 

thunderstorms; 

—  Improving the drought prediction and mitigation system.  

 

The above measures can be grouped in the following  programs: 

1- Groundwater protection 

Most  groundwater  aquifers  are  exploited  at  more  than  double  of  their  safe  yield.  The  sustainability  of 

 

12 

 

 

irrigation in the highlands and the Badia areas will be greatly endangered unless strict measures are taken 
to address this issue. As such, the development and implementation of an action plan is needed in order to 
ensure  that  plans  for  groundwater  protection,  management,  monitoring  and  restoration  are  defined, 
integrated and managed in a cost-effective manner. However, such action plan needs: 

*  A strong legal basis, given by laws and by-laws of the Water Authority, 2002; 
*  Guidelines and legal provisions; 
*  An administrative structure for implementation and survey; 
*  Public involvement; 
*  Measures will also continue to be taken to protect the groundwater resources from all sources of 

pollution. 

In order to improve groundwater situation in Jordan, MWI is establishing an integrated program to assess 
the availability and exploitability of all resources at rates that can be sustained over long periods of time. 
The  mining  of  renewable  groundwater  aquifers  will  be  checked,  controlled,  and  reduced  to  sustainable 
extraction  rates.  MWI  will  further  encourage  the  application  of  applied  research  activities,  including 
artificial  recharge  to  increase  groundwater  supplies,  and  the  employment  of  new  technologies  that  will 
optimize  operation  and  development  of  groundwater  systems  and  promote  more  efficient  and  feasible 
uses. 

2- Surface water development 

In Jordan, direct runoff from heavy rainfall lasts from less than an  hour to very few days. This makes the 
management of this type of resource difficult. Possible measures are: 

—  Optimizing the development and use of this resource through supply-enhancing measures, including 

surface and subsurface storage, minimizing losses by surface evaporation and seepage, soil and water 
programs, and protecting surface water supplies from pollution; 

—  Development of sustainable management plans for surface water systems in Jordan Valley, conversion 

of open canal systems to a pressurized pipe system, giving priority to modernizing and upgrading 
systems, and precedence to water projects which make significant contributions to meeting rising 
municipal and industrial demands; 

—  Dams are required for storing flood waters during the wet winter seasons and releasing the water 

gradually during the summer seasons when the demand is high. Additionally, ‘ordinary' reservoirs, so 
called desert dams (water harvesting) help increase groundwater recharge and provide water for 
pastoral use. 

3- Demand management 

Mobilization of additional water resources can be achieved through: 

—  Artificial groundwater recharge; 
—  Surface water reservoirs; 
—  Water harvesting; 
—  Increased re-use of treated wastewater; 
—  Use of non-conventional water resources; 
—  Desalination; 
—  Weather modification (cloud seeding); and 
—  Transfer of water among different basins in Jordan. 

 
Various projects have been set up to reduce water consumption and to enhance water use efficiency by: 

—  Reduction of losses from the supply networks; 
—  Introduction of water saving technologies; 
—  Public awareness campaigns on water consumption; 
—  Adaptation of different cropping patterns. 

4- Water resources monitoring system (quantity and quality) 

—  Ground water monitoring system; 
—  Surface water monitoring system; and 
—  Climate monitoring system.   

The water sector investment according to the Executive Development Program for the coming 10 years (2025)  
is estimated to reach US$ 4  billion.

4.2. Health sector adaptation actions 

 

 

In addition to the general adaptation objectives, measures and instruments proposed for the health sector in 
the National Climate Change Policy of Jordan (2013-2020), as well as in the TNC, the Ministry of Health (MoH) 
issued the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, Plan of Action, and  Early Warning System (EWS) to 
protect health from the potential impacts of climate change in 2013.  The health sector's adaptation strategy, 
plan  of  action  for  the  period  2013-2017,  and  EWS  would  have  long-term  potential  for  delivering  improved 
health outcomes. The Strategy provides a roadmap to the health sector, as well as the many involved public 
agencies and organizations, to work jointly to improve the health of the Jordanian population, in particular the 
vulnerable groups (infants and children < 5 years, the elderly > 65 years, and pregnant women) in rural, desert, 
remote  areas,  and  poverty  pockets,  and  the  environments  in  which  they  live,  work,  and  play.  The  health 
sector's adaptation to climate change focuses on the adequate intervention measures required to reduce the 
impact of climate change on six climate-sensitive health issues, namely: 

o  Heat waves (health impacts of temperature related events); 
o  Water and food-borne diseases; 
o  Vector-borne diseases; 
o  Air-borne and respiratory diseases; 
o  Nutrition and food security; and 
o  Occupational health 

The Action Plan (2013-2017) listed 24 proposed adaptation projects that fall under seven main categories as 
follows: 

(cid:173)  Regulatory/legislative; 
(cid:173)  Capacity building; 
(cid:173)  Public education and communication; 
(cid:173)  Surveillance and monitoring;  
(cid:173)  Medical intervention; 
(cid:173)  Infrastructure development; and 
(cid:173)  Research and further information.  

The proposed adaptation measures and projects are: 

—  Strengthening the preparedness and resilience of the health sector and increasing emergency rooms 

(ER) capacities; 

—  Building the needed capacities to conduct health vulnerability assessments; 
—  Educating and informing the public of the needed measures to protect health from the adverse 

impacts of climate change;  

—  Establishing an early warning system to trigger prompt public health intervention when certain 

variables exceed a defined threshold; 

—  Developing climate-informed disease control programs and surveillance systems using meteorological 

services to target vector control in time and space; 

—  Adopting more effective and rapid electronic exchange of surveillance data for rapid intervention, and 

establish, with the relevant ministry(ies), access to real-time air quality monitoring data to establish 
the link between respiratory diseases and air pollution and climate change; 

—  Introducing new indicators that are useful for protecting health, such as Air Quality Index, UV index, in 

cooperation with the relevant institutions; and 

—  Utilizing effective tools (e.g. GIS or Health Mapper) to link environmental and climatic factors to health 

outcomes. 

Details of the projects can be found in "CHAPTER 9 ADAPTATION PROJECT PROPOSALS FOR THE SIX CLIMATE-
SENSITIVE  HEALTH  ISSUES"  in  the  National  Climate  Change  Health  Adaptation  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  of 
Jordan, which can be accessed from the MoH's official website (www.moh.gov.jo). The estimated total cost for 
implementing the above mentioned projects and measures is USD 15,000,000. The information of portions of 
funds secured by the involved sector's (government) own means versus amount of funds not secured is not 
available  at  the  time  of  preparing  this  document  and  could  be  obtained  from  the  health  sector's  involved 
officials.. 

4.3. Biodiversity, eco-systems, and protected areas adaptation actions 

The  expected  impacts  from  climate  change  on  ecosystems  in  Jordan  according  to  climate  exposure  and 
sensitivity of ecosystems are droughts, forest dieback, and community composition change, expansion of drier 
biomes into  marginal  lands,  habitat  degradation and  species loss.  It  was  noticed  that  the  highest  vulnerable 
ecosystems are forests (especially in the north) and fresh water ecosystems (especially in Jordan Rift Valley), 
that  highlights  the  priority  to  perform adaptation  interventions  within these  two  ecosystems.  The ecological 

 

14 

 

 

vulnerability assessment results that covered important biodiversity and ecosystem sites within the pilot area 
including  Dibeen  PA  and  Khyouf  SCA  had  high  scores  of  vulnerability  that  is  compatible  with  the  overall 
conclusion  all  over  the  Country.  Adaptation  strategies  and  measures  in  biodiversity  should be  prepared  and 
implemented in order to achieve sustainable, healthy and resilient ecosystems in the future under threats of 
climate  change  and  other  stressors.  Jordan  has  conducted  good  number  of  adaptation  projects  for  the 
biodiversity  and protected areas  for  the  pre-2020  period  such  as  Royal  Society  for  Conservation of  Nature's 
(RSCN) project. 

In addition to the adaptation strategies mentioned in Jordan's Third National Communication (TNC) on climate 
change (please referee to the TNC to capture the adaptation priorities), the GoJ, through its strategic partners, 
mainly  RSCN,  Royal  Botanic  Garden,  and  IUCN-ROWA,  intends  to  carry  out  the  following  actions  that  are 
envisaged to contribute to increase the adaptive capacity of the country's ecosystems to climate change, these 
are: 

— Conducting a comprehensive review of the National Network of Protected Areas. The sought revision will 
aim  at  identifying/validating  climate-vulnerable  ecosystems,  extending  conservation  efforts  in  PA-
surroundings and designing buffer zones as deemed necessarily for strengthening the adaptive capacities 
of key ecological hotspots (time frame : by 2020); 

— Establishing,  in  partnership  with  RSCN,  a  specialized  unit  that  is  responsible  for  implementing  the 
adaptation strategies, liaising with different national stakeholders and formulating a range of ecosystem 
adaptation projects within Jordan (time frame : by 2025); 

— Undertaking  more  research  on  vulnerable  ecosystems  and  communities  and  appropriate  adaptation 
priorities, in addition to identifying indicator species and carry out monitoring programs on climate change 
impact on key species. (time frame : by 2030); 

— Enhancing the resilience of local communities impacted by climate change in areas within and surrounding 

PAs (including community-based pilot adaptation projects) (time frame : by 2030). 

— Embarking on land use planning as a tool for adaptation to climate change, given that land use planning 
reduces  the  future  carbon  impact  of  new  developments  as  well  as  improving  resilience  against  natural 
hazards associated with climate change such as, but not limited to, drought and floods) (time frame: by 
2030). 

The total cost of the above activities is USD 3,000,000. The information of portions of fund secures by involved 
sector's  own  means  versus  amount  of  funds  not  secured  is  not  available  at  the  time  of  preparing  this 
document and could be obtained from the activesaid sector. 

4.4. Agriculture/food security adaptation actions 

Agricultural  production  is  closely  tied  to  climate,  making  agriculture  one  of  the  most  climate-sensitive  of  all 
economic sectors. In the study area selected as a pilot in the TNC (2014), the climate risks to the agricultural 
sector are immediate and an important problem because the majority of the rural population depend either 
directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. TNC analyses demonstrated that most of agricultural 
areas in Jordan are rain-fed which makes agriculture in Jordan more susceptible to climate change. 

The  rural  poor  will be  disproportionately  affected  because  of  their  greater  dependence  on agriculture,  their 
relatively  lower  ability  to  adapt,  and  the  high  share  of  income  they  spend  on  food.  Climate  impacts  could 
therefore  undermine  progress  that  has  been  made  in  poverty  reduction  and  adversely  impact  food  security 
and economic  growth in  vulnerable rural  areas.  Poor  in  rural  areas  in  Jordan  are expected  to  face  the  most 
severe  consequences  of  climate  change  through  disruption  of  livelihood  options  that  depend  on  natural 
resource management. The expected impacts of climate change, particularly reduced agricultural productivity 
and  water  availability,  threaten  livelihoods  and  keep  vulnerable  people  insecure.  Thus,  the  key  adaptation 
measure  to  climate  change  in  the  agricultural/food  security  sector  will  be  setting  and  implementing  a 
sustainable agriculture policy addressing; 

— Developing  agronomic  and  crop  strategies  that  are  intended  to  offset  either  partially  or  completely  the 
loss  of  productivity  caused  by  climate  change  through  the  application  of  defense  tools  with  different 
temporal  scales,  e.g.  short  term  adjustments  and  long  term  adaptations,  and  spatial  scales,  e.g.  farm, 
regional or national level adaptation; 

— Modification of policies and implementation of action plans with emphasis on socio-economic strategies 

intended to meet the agricultural costs of climate change; 

— Supporting  environment  friendly  agriculture  and  permaculture  designs  as  well  as  conservation  and 
sustainable  utilization  of  plant  and  animals  genetic  resources  for  food  and  agriculture  that  are  climate 
resilient and adaptive to climate change especially landraces to improve rural sector adaptive capacity to 
changing  environment to enhance food security; 

— Maintenance of old Romanian wells for water harvesting purposes and establishment of new wells in the 

rural area;  

— Establishment of an integrated drought monitoring and early warning systems; 

 

15 

 

 

— Use of different crops varieties and modification of cropping pattern and crop calendar including planting 

and harvesting dates; 

— Implementation of supplemental irrigation, water harvesting techniques, maximizing treated waste water 
re-use  in  agriculture,  improving  water  use efficiency  and  the  augmentation of  drip  irrigation in  irrigated 
areas and utilization of saline water in the irrigation of crops tolerant to salinity; 

— Establishment of desalinization units or sea water and use for agriculture; 
— For  rain-fed  areas:  adaptation  measures  include,  but  not  limited  to,  improving  soil  water  storage  to 
maximize  plant  water  availability  by  maximizing  infiltration  of  rainfall;  application  of  conservation 
agriculture, which involves minimum soil disturbance and encompasses land preparation techniques that 
improve  soil  fertility;  managing  crop  residue  and  tillage  and  conserving  soil  and  water;  using  of 
supplemental  irrigation from  harvested rainwater  in  the  critical  stages of  crop growth  achieved  through 
on-farm rainwater harvesting and management system, i.e. small farm ponds for microirrigation using drip 
or  sprinkler  irrigation  systems.  Larger  rainwater  storage  structures  to  be  constructed  to  provide 
supplementary irrigation water to a number of small farms or fields by using the micro-dams; 

— Selection  of  tolerant  crop  varieties:  shifting  to  cultivating  crops  that  are  more  tolerant  to  droughts  or 

lower water requirements; 

— Crop diversification: including integration of different varieties of crops, both food and cash crops which 

will increase farmers' income; 

— Urgent  need  for restoration of  the  degraded forest ecosystem,  protection  of  forest  and  reforestation to 
increase the green land area for compensation and  equilibrium purposes for CO2 fixation and release of O₂ 
since forestry sector face many challenges that result in reduction of forest vegetation cover in Jordan to 
sustain and keep ecosystem services from this vital ecosystem;   

— Raising  awareness  and  declarations  on  Climate  Intelligent  Agriculture  and  promoting  utilization  of 
renewable energy and uses  in agricultural and food production sector for cooling and heating purposes, 
for example in  poultry production, nurseries, green houses, olive mill etc; 

— Model  development  of  the  soilless  and  hydroponic  agriculture  for  medicinal  and  herbal  plants  and 

vegetables for water saving; and 

— Establishment of an integrated national monitoring center for climate information and data based linking 

weather and climate information from all deployed centers. 

The pre-2020 information of portion of fund secured by involved sector's (government) own means shows that 
the GoJ spent about USD 160,000,000 on adaptation projects and activities in the agriculture and food security 
sectors  in  the  country  from  its  own  means.  The  amount  of  needed  fund  was  not  available  at  the  time  of 
preparing this document and could be obtained from officials active in this field. 

4.5. Sustainable development-oriented socioeconomic adaptation  

The pre-2020 contribution of Jordan in this regard is obvious from Jordan's position portrayed in the Climate 
Change  Policy  of  Jordan  2013-2020  and  the  actions  and  activities  lead  by  Ministry  of  Social  Development 
(MoSD); National Aid Fund (NAF), and MoSD's  partners addressing vulnerability and impact of climate change 
on socio-economic development particularly vulnerable groups (mainly the poor and women with emphasis on 
those living in rural areas). Major initiatives and actions that are contributed by Jordan for inclusion of social 
dimensions in adaptation and mitigation responses, in coordination with MoSD, include, but not limited to: 

— Adopting  poverty  fight  programs  fostering  providing  housing  for  poor  people  and  supporting  micro-
projects  for  poor  communities  in  light  of  unusual  severe  seasonal  cold  and  hot  weather  conditions 
prevailed in the last decade (the coldest/snowy condition of 2013/2014 in the last 10 years and a record 
hot year in the summer of 2015);  

— Developing emergency relief and aid to those affected by impacts of seasonal heavy snow storms specially 

the unusual latest storms;  

— Diversifying income sources for affected communities from severe hot and cold conditions; 
— Proposing on the National Budget a cost of 90,000 JOD to providing solar energy cells for poor household 

complexes and Nursing Homes to reduce electricity bills and increase access to clean energy sources; 

— Replacing 10 large engine vehicles of the Ministry's fleet with hybrid cars;   
— Assisting poor household complexes by installing water harvesting wells; and  
— Investigating role of severe hot and cold weather conditions on rates of society crimes. 

Jordan actions on the path towards a sustainable development-oriented socio-economic adaptation and the 
country's efforts in investigating the alleviation of climate change impacts on vulnerable groups could be seen 
in the following perspectives and actions: 

*  With regard to socio-economic cost-benefit analysis of the climate change mitigation and adaptation 
in  the  context  of  green  growth,  Jordan  actions  in  this  aspect  stems  out  from  the Country's  position 

 

16 

 

 

that the socio-economic costs and benefits of climate change mitigation can only be assessed together 
with  the  other  cost  and  benefits  related  to  climate  change  mitigation  activities.  Energy-efficiency 
measures, for example, will also have an impact on economic growth, technology innovation, reducing 
import dependency and reducing poverty, amongst others.  

*  Dependence of such vulnerable groups on natural resources that are susceptible to climate change. It 
was  found  that  20%  of  the  population  depends  on  agriculture  for  their  income.  Agriculture 
vulnerability  especially  the rain  fed  and  irrigated  was  also  discussed  in  detail in  the  Climate  Change 
Policy of Jordan. These discussions lead to the conclusion that this 20% of population which is part of 
the poorest segment will be most susceptible to climate change impacts; 

*  Dependence of communities on ecosystem services (water springs, rangelands and natural vegetation 

in medicine, etc.) that could be affected by climate change; 

*  A lack of assets which hinders effective adaptation by the poor segments of population; 

* 

* 

Settlements  in  high-risk  areas  (i.e.  drought  prone)  in  Jordan  are  known  to  be  of  the  lower  income 
groups, a fact which magnifies the impact of climate change on poverty of these groups; 

Low levels of education and professional skills that prevent members of poor households for shifting 
to climate-resilient sources of income; and 

*  Though gender  issues  are  still  under-investigated  in  Jordan,  the  role  of  women  in  economy  of  rural 
areas  is  known  to  be  substantial.  Women  in  these  areas  are  traditionally  responsible  for  the 
household economy and are active in field work as well. Any negative impact of climate change will be 
most  sensed  by  women.  Women  make  crucial  contributions  in  agriculture  and  rural  enterprises  in 
drylands  as  farmers,  animal  husbandry,  workers  and  entrepreneurs  through  their  indigenous 
knowledge. 

Thus, Jordan is committed to the following climate change strategic objectives and actions as related 
to sustainable development-oriented socio-economic adaptation with emphasis on vulnerable groups 
and gender mainstreaming. 

For post-2020 actions, GoJ through MoSD proposes to: 

— Providing support to civil society organizations and NGOs active in climate change from CBO Support Fund; 
— Conducting awareness programs targeting local communities and societies on energy efficiency; 
— Maximizing  number  of  poor  household  complexes  and  Nursing  Homes  benefiting  from  solar  energy 

technologies and installing solar water heaters;  

— Developing emergency and fast response plan to providing emergency relief and aid to those affected by 
impacts of seasonal severe cold (mainly during snow storms) and hot conditions and support programs for 
incomes of families impacted by drought;   

— Integrating  gender  considerations  and  the  interest  of  vulnerable  group  in  climate  change  policies  and 
strategies  in  all  relevant  sectors  particularly  in  national  strategies  for  social  development,  poverty 
eradication,  childhood  and  early  childhood  development  in  Jordan  and  develop,  compile,  and  share 
practical  tools,  information,  and  methodologies  to  facilitate  the  integration  of  gender  into  policy  and 
programming; 

— Ensuring  that  financing  mechanisms  on  mitigation  and  adaptation  address  the  needs  and  conditions  for 

implementation of poor women and men equally;  

— Building  capacity  at  all  levels  to  design  and  implement  gender-responsive  climate  change  policies, 

strategies and programs; 

— Ensuring  that  sector  ministries  will adopt  the  Action Plans  suggested  by  the  Program  for  Mainstreaming 
Gender in Climate Change Efforts in Jordan, the action plans specified the objectives, the actions and the 
indicators required. MoEnv and NCCC to monitor and encourage the implementation. 

— Aligning  Jordan's  INDC  to  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  agreed  by  the  international 
community in August 2015 which will cover all development goals until 2030. Special attention will be put 
on  linking  the  mitigation  and  adaptation  measures  specified  in  the  INDC  and  beyond  to  SDGs  from  1-5 
which  focus  on  addressing  challenges  of  poverty,  education,  health,  gender  equality  and  other  socio-
economic conditions;  

 

17 

 

 

- 

-  Aligning Jordan's INDC with the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) that was launched in 2013. The 
PRS contains a special chapter on the resilience and adaptation to climate change impacts in Jordan and 
the enhancement of social structure to adapt to climate change.  
Enhancing  codes  of  buildings  for  newly  established  residential  complexes  targeting  poor  families  to 
include proper insulation; and  
Supporting  care  giving  houses  for  the  orphans,  people  with  special  needs  and  elderly  people  with 
measures to install solar energy and production of own electricity needs.
