1  National Context 

 

Lao PDR has a long term goal for national development which is set out in the 8th Five Year National 
Socio-economic Plan (2016-2020), with a Vision to 2030.  According to this vision, the goal is for Lao 
PDR to make the transition from a Least Developed Country (LDC) to a middle income country by 2030 
supported by inclusive, stable and sustainable economic growth whilst alleviating poverty. Lao PDR 
recognises the strong link between economic development, sustainability and the need to mainstream 
environmental considerations, including action on climate change into its development plans.  

The  Climate Change  and Disaster Law  is being developed  and the overarching legal  framework for 
climate change and disaster management is provided in the law. The law is expected to be approved 
in 2017. 

The National Strategy on Climate Change (NSCC) of Lao PDR was approved in early 2010, and states a 
vision on how to address climate change1:  

"To  secure  a  future  where  Lao  PDR  is  capable  of  mitigating  and  adapting  to  changing  climatic 
conditions in a way that promotes sustainable economic development, reduces poverty, protects 
public health and safety, enhances the quality of Lao PDR's natural environment, and advances 
the quality of life for all Lao People" 

 

 

In addition to the overarching strategy set out in the NCCS, climate change action plans for the period 
2013-2020 define mitigation and adaptation actions in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, land use 
change, water resources, energy, transportation, industry and public health.  

Lao PDR is highly climate-vulnerable, and the country's greenhouse (GHG) emissions were only 51,000 
Gg2 in the year 2000, which is negligible compared to total global emissions. Despite this, Lao PDR has 
ambitious plans to reduce its GHG emissions while at the same time increasing its resilience to the 
negative impacts of climate change. Examples of such plans include the following: 

*  An ambitious target is set out in the National Forestry Strategy to the Year 2020 for increasing 
forest cover to a total of 70% of land area by 2020, and maintaining it at that level going forward. 
This  will  reduce  the  risk  of  floods  and  prevent  land  degradation,  yet  at  the  same  time  the 
greenhouse gas mitigation potential of such a target is substantial and long lasting. 

* 

In terms of Lao PDR's large scale electricity generation, the electricity grid draws on renewable 
resources for almost 100% of its output. Lao PDR also aims at utilising unexploited hydropower 
resources to export clean electricity to its neighbours. By supplying neighbouring countries such 
as Cambodia, Viet Nam, Thailand and Singapore with hydroelectricity, Lao PDR is enabling other 
countries in South East Asia to develop and industrialise in a sustainable manner. 

*  The Government of Lao PDR has also laid the foundations for the implementation a renewable 
energy strategy that aims to increase the share of small scale renewable energy to 30% of total 
energy consumption by 2030.

PDR (2013) used data of the year 2000.  
 

 

Climate change is already causing economic loss and affecting the livelihoods, food security, water 
supply and health of much of the country's population. The frequency and intensity of climate related 
hazards such as droughts and floods are expected to increase in future, so Lao PDR must also urgently 
take steps to build its resilience by enhancing its adaptation efforts across all sectors. A more detailed 
summary  of  the  vulnerabilities  to  climate  change  and  the  adaptation  actions  proposed  to  address 
them are discussed further in Section 3 of this INDC.  
 
Lao PDR is committed to the implementation of its NCCS and its sectoral climate change action plans, 
for the national, regional and global benefit. However, it will require technical and financial support 
to deliver the mitigation and adaptation actions identified herein. With such support, the NCCS will be 
most efficiently implemented,  the potential GHG reductions identified will be optimised, and Lao PDR 
can most effectively adapt to the negative and immediate effects of climate change.  
 

2  Mitigation  
2.1 

 Mitigation Contribution 

 

Lao PDR has identified a number of actions which it intends to undertake in order reduce its future 
GHG  emissions,  subject  to  the  provision  of  international  support.  These  are  outlined  in  Table  1 
together with preliminary estimates of the projected emissions reductions which will occur as a result.  
These estimates have been drawn from a variety of sources and need to be reviewed and updated to 
address consistency and accuracy in analytical methods once more reliable data and information are 
available. Details of the mitigation actions, implementation plans and support needs are outlined in 
Section 4 and Annex 1 respectively.

2.2  Ambitious and Fair   
Lao PDR's GHG emissions are very low in the global context, and its historic contribution to climate 
change  has  been  minimal.  Despite  this  and  its  status  as  a  Least  Developed  Country  (LDC),  the 
Government  of  Lao PDR  intends  to  implement  policies  that support  the  long term  goal of  limiting 
global GHG emissions in line  with the objectives of the  UNFCCC and the findings of the  IPCC's 5th 
Assessment  Report.  These  represent  the  first  time  that  Lao  PDR  has  made  an  international 
undertaking to take action on mitigation and therefore fulfils the requirements of the Lima Call for 
Climate Action to go beyond existing efforts.  
 
In order to maximise the ambition of its mitigation contribution while taking into account the need for 
economic development, Lao PDR has prioritised mitigation actions that both address the main causes 
of future increases in emissions and also have significant development co-benefits. This is considered 
to  be  a  fair  approach  to  the  nation's  first  INDC.  Forestry  based  actions  will  not  only  increase  the 
amount  of  GHG  sinks  in  Lao  PDR,  but  will  also  provide  adaptation  co-benefits  contributing  to 
prevention of flooding, soil erosion and landslides, protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services. 
Improving public transport will not only result in less GHG emissions as a result of travel, but will also 
improve  air  quality  and  support  more  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  rural  electrification 
programme will reduce GHG emissions, promote rural development and reduce poverty. Finally, the 
export of hydropower to other countries in the region will allow their economies to grow in a more 
sustainable manner, by replacing consumption of fossil fuels.  
 

 
 

This INDC includes a mix of plans which are being undertaken by the Government of Lao PDR including 
those supported by overseas development assistance. Lao PDR is also implementing other relevant 
national and local plans such as the allocation of approximately USD 12 million annually for disaster 
emergency response plans. This demonstrates that Lao PDR is not content to wait for international 
support  to  take  action  on  climate  change.  However,  reforestation  and  maintenance  of  forests  for 
example is a major challenge for a country such as Lao PDR, so there is strong desire to achieve success 
with international programmes and assistance such as REDD+ and FLEGT.   
 
Overall, in order to achieve maximum mitigation potential, further international support is required 
by Lao PDR. The main support needs are as set out in the Section 4 and Annex 1 of this INDC.  

3  Adaptation 

 

As set out in the vision for the NSCC referred to in Section 1, Lao PDR intends to balance its need for 
development without compromising its environment. For climate change adaptation this translates 
into the following goals which are articulated in the NSCC: 

* 

Increase resilience of key economic sectors and natural resources to climate change and its 
impacts  

*  Enhance  cooperation,  strong  alliances  and  partnerships  with  national  stakeholders  and 

international partners to achieve national development goals 

* 

Improve public awareness and understanding of various stakeholders about climate change, 
vulnerabilities and impacts in order to increase stakeholder willingness to take actions. 

 

Lao  PDR's  economy  is  already  experiencing  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  and  the  majority  of 
population  remains  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  hazards  in  particular  floods  and  droughts.  This  is 
because  Lao  PDR's  economy  and  over  70%  of  population  depends  on  natural  resources  for  their 
livelihoods and to ensure food security. The agriculture sector is responsible for 29.9 % of GDP and 
approximately 70% of the population are  dependent on the sector for their livelihoods.  Increasing 
climate  resilience  with  respect  to  agriculture  is  therefore  a  high  priority  especially  food  security. 
Another high priority is the provision and management of water resources as this contributes to social 
wellbeing, economic productivity and water supply for agriculture, industrial processes and energy 
production.  
 
Flooding is a major climate risk in the country, threatening livelihoods almost every year. 14 out of 17 
provinces as well as the Vientiane capital have experienced floods since 1995. The country's annual 
rainfall is expected to increase its variability which, accompanied with increase in temperature could 
have significant impact on water resources, ecosystems and agricultural production. In addition floods 
have  an  adverse  impact  housing,  health  and  education,  industrial  activities,  and  infrastructure 
(transportation,  water  and  sanitation).  As  an  example  the  flooding  in  2005  caused  widespread 
disruption and the estimated economic costs were USD 29 million3. 
 
Lao PDR is also experiencing increasingly frequent episodes of drought. Severe drought occurred in 
1996, 1998 and 2003. It is estimated that 6 out of 17 provinces are already at high risk of droughts. 
Droughts  adversely  affect  water  resources,  hydroelectricity  generation  and  agricultural  production 
resulting in widespread economic losses.  
 

                                                           
3 Lao PDR Second National Communication (2013) 

 
 

The  National  Adaptation  Programme  of  Action  (2009)  maps  out  a  country-driven  programme  to 
address immediate and projected climate change adaptation requirements in the agriculture, forestry, 
water resources and public health sectors. The adaptation programme was further developed in the 
NSCC  to  cover  the  main  sectors  of  the  economy  which  are  identified  as  the  agriculture  and  food 
security, forestry and land use change, water, energy and transport, urban development, industry and 
public health sectors, which are intended for implementation by 2020.  
 
One of the  guiding  principles  of the  NSCC  is  to  develop  and  implement  integrated  adaptation  and 
mitigation solutions, i.e. that are low-cost, improve energy efficiency, promote cleaner production, 
and provide adaptation/mitigation synergies as well as economic, environmental and socioeconomic 
benefits.  Hydroelectricity has great potential in Lao PDR providing clean energy,  an  opportunity  to 
reduce  GHG  emissions  and  also  meet  other  objectives  such  as  flood,  irrigation  and  water  supply 
management. The forestry sector contributes to both national economy and also livelihoods of many 
Laotians  for  example.  Sustainable  forest  management  therefore  improves  the  resilience  of 
communities  and  ecosystems  and  at  the  same  time  reduces  GHG  emissions  by  absorbing  carbon 
dioxide.  
 
In order to work towards achieving the NSCC's vision and goals and effectively implement the climate 
change action plans for all sectors, development of an M&E system is an immediate need for Lao PDR. 
Table  2  and  Annex  2  reflect  the  nation's  adaptation  priorities  given  the  current  understanding  of 
expected climate impacts. These actions will be continuously assessed and improved when monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) data and new information about climate change and impacts become available.

INDC Development Process and Implementation Plan 

This  INDC  has  been  prepared  through  an  inclusive  stakeholder  consultation  process  including  line 
ministries,  research  insitutions,  civil  organizations,  provincial  governments,  private  sector  and 
international development partners. The main sources of information to prepare this document were 
the 7th and 8th five year National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2011-2015 and 2016-2020 , with 
a Vision to 2030 (2011 and 2015), National Climate Change Strategy (2010), Forestry Strategy to the 
Year  2020  of  the  Lao  PDR  (2005),  Renewable  Energy  Development  Strategy  (2011),  Sustainable 
Transport Development Strategy (2010), Climate Change Action Plan of Lao PDR for 2013-2020 (2013), 
National  Adaptaion  Programme  of  Action  (2009)  and  the  Second  National  Communication  to  the 
UNFCCC (2013) and Investment and Financial Flows to address climate change in Energy, Agriculture 
and Water Sector (2015).  

The  cross-ministerial  National  Disaster  Management  Committee  (NDMC)  will  oversee  the  overall 
implementation of the INDC. Using the NDMC's existing structure, the Ministry of Natural Resources 
and  Environment  (MoNRE)  will  act  as  secretariate.  This  will  involve  coordination  with  relevant 
ministries and cooperation with international stakeholders to access finance and capacity building for 
the implementation of the INDC including the establishment and implementation of MRV.  

MoNRE will disseminate the  INDC  and later the results of the COP 21 to relevant ministries  in the 
central and line  agencies in the  local levels.  The INDC will also  be  incorporated in the 8th  National 
Socio-Economic Development Plan to ensure the continued mainstreaming of climate related policy 
in overall national plans. 

The INDC will be implemeneted in a coordinated manner with the NCCS, climate change action plans 
and the sectoral plans. The current climate change action plans run until 2020 and Lao PDR will start 
devising the next set of action plans to continue to implement the NCCS before the end of the year 
2020. Details of the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation actions identified in Sections 2 
and 3 of this INDC are set out  in Annexes 1 and 2 respectively.   

To facilitate the implementation of the INDC and ensure climate change action plans are executed in 
the most effective, efficienct and economic manner, MoNRE will carry out four elements as follows: 

 

1.  Overall  strategy,  coordination  of  INDC  implementation  and  regulatory  framework:  will  be 
established  by  MoNRE.  Effective  arrangements  for  liaison  with  line  ministries  responsible  for 
aspects of the INDC, international stakeholders and development partners, at national and local 
levels  to  facilitate  implementation  of  the  INDC  will  be  put  in  place.  This  will  also  include 
strengthening  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  especailly  continue  development  and 
promulgation of the Climate Change and Disaster Law, which is expected to be in 2017. This law 
will  be  a  continuum  for earlier  achievements  on climate  change  polices  and  plans  such  as  the 
Environmental  Protection  Law,  Revised  Urban  Planning  Law,  Strategic  Plan  on  Disaster 
Management 2020 (2003) and the National Strategy on Climate Change (2010). 

 

2.  Capacity building: one of the biggest requirements above all is to instigate the development of 
technical  capacity  -  not  just  across  sectors,  but  at  all  levels  of  engagement  from  central 
government  decision-makers  through  to  local  levels  and  technical  staff.  In  mitigation  capacity 
building is needed for example in feasibility studies, mitigation analysis and policy development. 

 
 

Regarding adaptation capacity building is needed in understanding the climate change impacts, 
adaptation  measures  including  technical  requirements  of  the  adaptation  measures  such  as 
drought-  and  flood-resistant  varieties  of  crops,  research  into  new  crops  and  climate  resilient 
technologies  as  well  as  on  how  the  adaptation  measures  will  impact  on  communities  and 
environments.  

3.  Finance: in summary, there are broadly eight main steps that will need to be followed in order to 
ensure that domestic and international finance is  successfully acquired, utilised and accounted 
for4: 

Identify policy mix and sources of financing 
Identify access routes to multilateral finance 

a.  Assess needs, define priorities, and identify barriers to investment 
b. 
c. 
d.  Blend and combine resources 
e.  Formulate projects, programmes and sector-wide approaches to access finance 
f. 
g. 
h.  MRV / M&E of climate finance  

Implementation and execution of planned action 
Implementation and management of project coordination systems 

 

With respect to domestic resources for climate action, Lao PDR has apportioned USD12.5 million for 
climate change which represented approximately 0.14% of GDP in 2012. In order to implement the 
mitigation  actions  and  address  adaptation  needs  international  support  in  the  form  of  financial, 
technology  transfer  and  capacity  building  is  needed.  An  initial  estimate  of  the  financial  needs  for 
implementing identified mitigation and adaptation policies and actions is US$ 1.4 billion5 and US$ 0.97  
billion6, and details are provided in Annex 1 (mitigation) and Annex 2 (adaptation) respectively.   

 

4.  Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV):  an MRV system  is the cornerstone of  effective 
national implementation as it allows progress against implementation plans to be demonstrated 
and provides data for learning for future project development. Lao PDR recognises that its capacity 
with respect to MRV requires development if the climate change goals set out in this INDC are to 
be realised. Specifically, a GHG inventory system, NAMA MRV framework, adaptation evaluation 
indicators and tracking systems for climate finance need to be developed. In the immediate term, 
in order to develop MRV system, Lao PDR intends to carry out the following:

Readiness_for_Climate_Finance.pdf  
5 The cost was calculated based on the cost estimated in the Investments and Financial Flows to Address 
Climate Change in Energy, Agriculture and Water Sectors; the Forestry Strategy to the year 2020 of the Lao 
PDR, Renewable Development Strategy in Lao PDR; Country Partnership Strategy between ADB-Lao PDR, 2012-
2020; Mitigation Cost in Different Sectors presented in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report; Resources 
Requirements for Aichi Targets 11-Proected Areas; Global Review of the Protected Area Budget ad Staff and 
expert judgements. 
6 The cost was calculated based on the cost estimated in the Investments and Financial Flows to Address 
Climate Change in Energy, Agriculture and Water Sectors, NAPA and expert judgements. 
 

 

  Readiness  assessments:  these  will  identify  the  current  state  and  barriers  on  data, 
organisational  arrangements,  personnel  capacity,  national  policies,  and  any  existing 
domestic MRV systems. 

  Capacity building: once the readiness assessment is complete, a capacity development plan 
will be produced and implemented, and tools will be provided in order to carry out MRV 
inclusively.   
 

 

 

 

Annex 1: Mitigation Measures 
Please note that investment estimates will need to be investigated further as one of the first steps of 
implementing the INDC. Figures presented in these Annexes are indicative estimates. 

Forestry Strategy to the Year 2020 of the Lao PDR 
 
Description 

Trees and forests are GHG sinks, i.e. they absorb carbon dioxide. They also preserve 
land  quality  which  mitigates  the  risk  of  flooding  and  landslides.  Increasing  and 
maintaining  total  forest  cover  therefore  has  significant  mitigation  impacts  and 
development co-benefits.  
 
The objective of this activity includes increasing total forest cover to 70% of land area 
(i.e. to 16.58 million hectares). Once the target is achieved, emission reductions will 
carry on beyond 2030 as forest cover is maintained. 
2000 
Please  refer  to  the  calculations  presented  in  Lao  PDR's  Second  National 
Communication  to  the  UNFCCC,  chapter  4,  sections  4.4.2  and  4.4.5  and  the 
Technology Needs Assessment (2013).  The base year of 2000 is selected as this is 
the latest emissions inventory calculated, which was part of the process of compiling 
the Second National Communication. 
 
 
If these measures are implemented effectively, the country successfully increases its 
natural forest coverage to 70 percent (about 16.58 million ha) with additional 500,000 
ha  of  plantation,  logging  and  conversion  forest  under  control  until  2020.  In  this 
scenario,  the  forests  in  the  Lao  PDR  would  be  able  to  sequestrate  about  60,000-
69,000 ktCO2e by 2020. 
* 

Implementation of the plans set out in the Forestry Strategy to the Year 2020 of 
the Lao PDR. As the strategy runs until 2020, Lao PDR will start revising the next 
set of action plans to maintain forest cover at 70% after the target date of 2020.  
Work on developing the new strategy will begin in 2018.  

 
* 

 
* 

Implementation of REDD+ programme which has provided a framework for the 
development of the forestry sector in Lao PDR since around 2007. As early as 
2009,  a  number  of  REDD+  pilot  activities  and  projects  supported  through 
development partners were initiated, and in 2010,  Lao PDR became one of the 
first  pilot  countries  under  the  Forest  Investment  Program  (FIP)  too  which  is  a 
multilateral programme under the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). 

Implementation of the voluntary partnership agreement (VPA)  which is bilateral 
trade agreement between the EU and a timber-exporting country outside the EU, 
that the Government of Lao PDR announced its interest in negotiating a VPA in 
February 2012.

the Goal 

The  Renewable  Energy  Strategy  (2011)  outlines  actions  and plans  to  increase  the 
use of small scale hydropower, solar energy, biomass, biogas, municipal solid waste 
to energy and wind technologies, as well as transport fuels (bioethanol and biodiesel) 
to provide clean energy to consumers. 
*  To increase the share of renewable energy to meet 30% of energy consumption 

by 2025.  

*  To increase the share of biofuels to meet 10% of the demand for transport fuels 

by 2025. 

2011 
For  further  information  please  see  the  Renewable  Energy  Development  Strategy 
(2011) of Lao PDR. Note: these are preliminary estimates and will be reviewed and 
updated  once  technical  capacity  has  been  built  and  more  reliable  data  is  made 
available. 

1,468,000 ktCO2e (by 2025).  
 
 
The  Renewable  Energy  Strategy  was  approved  at  the  national  level  in  2011.  The 
Ministry of Energy and Mines is the main agency responsible for renewable energy 
coordination and its main functions include the following: 
 
*  Develop  an  overall  renewable  energy  policy  and  support  the  achievement  of 

sustainable development goals 

*  Set-up objectives and goals based on resource potentials and develop renewable 

energy database 

*  Carry  out  studies  and  demonstration  projects  utilising  renewable  energy 

technologies. 

 
In  addition,  other  ministries  have  responsibilities  under  the  Renewable  Energy 
Strategy: 
 

                                                           
7 The Forest Strategy to the year 2020 
8 Current cost of forest management especially protected area management in Laos is estimated to be few US$ 
per ha  
9 The global mean budget for protected areas is $893 per km² in 1996 US$. The developed countries mean is 
$2,058 per km² while the developing countries mean is $157 per km² (WCPA, 1999).  
10 Estimated costs to develop and manage protected area effectively are: a) a low scenario of US$8,000/km2; b) 
a medium scenario of US$16,000/km2; and c) a high scenario of US$24,000/km2 (Ervin and Gidda, 2012). 
 

 

Implementation of Renewable Energy Development Strategy  
 

*  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in collaboration with Ministry of Natural 
Resource and Environment and provincial authorities, will determine and develop 
policies related to the most effective use of lands for plantation of crops for fuel 
and industrial uses, carry out participatory land use planning and local land use 
zoning, and monitor and enforce the implementation of the policy 

*  The  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  is  responsible  for 
undertaking research on the use of water resources and will collaborate with the 
Ministry of Energy and Mines on studies concerning production of hydrogen fuels. 
Further,  they  are  responsible  for  developing  and  enforcing  requirements  and 
guidelines and to minimise the environmental  and social  impacts of renewable 
energy development through oversight of Initial Environmental Examinations and 
carrying out environmental impact assessments 

*  The Ministry of Science and Technology has the role of conducting research and 
pilot  tests  on  science  and  technologies  developed  from  different  countries,  for 
renewable energy applications 

*  The Ministry of Industry and Commerce facilitates the importation of equipment 
and  machinery,  seeds  and  vehicles  related  to  the  development  of  renewable 
energies,  as  well  as  supporting  the  construction  of  gas  stations  for  biofuel 
distribution 

*  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transportation  will  be  responsible  for  the 
introduction  of  policies  that  promote  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  in  individual 
vehicles, public transportation systems, freight and air transport 

*  The Ministry of Finance determines appropriate tax and duties policies for land 
use, vehicles and equipment to be used for renewable energy projects while at 
the same time assisting in raising funds for renewable energy development 

*  The Central Bank of Lao PDR will consider carbon credits and low interest loans 
as sources of financing for renewable energy projects and activities, agricultural 
promotion  and  fuel  crops  plantation  development  and  projects  carried  out  by 
small and medium enterprises. 

 
Regarding implementation, the first step would be an assessment and update of the 
Renewable Energy Strategy including analysis of:  

i.  Resources available, identifying gaps and opportunities for improvements in 
technology selection and sources. Specifically, the gaps that require analysis 
in Lao PDR include: 

i.  Political, legal, regulatory and institutional gaps 

ii.  Economic, financial and market gaps 

iii.  Technology, human capacity and infrastructure gaps 

j.  Current levels of deployment and their management  

k.  Current targets for supply and how they are aligned with demand forecasts 

l.  Support policies such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and import duties 

m.  Market readiness to encourage investment by the private sector. 

 

As a result, Lao PDR's energy focal points and related organisations will be able to 
comply with all related international agreements with respect to energy supply and 
trading. Its regulatory system would be strengthened, giving Lao PDR a more 
organised and authoritative voice when negotiating with potential partners.

Expansion in the use of large-scale hydroelectricity  
 
Description 

Objective 

Lao PDR has great potential for hydroelectricity generation and is often referred to as 
"the battery of South-East Asia". Exporting of clean energy powers green growth in 
neighbouring countries and provides foreign exchange earnings and employment in 
Lao PDR.  
The objective of this activity is to build large-scale hydropower plants to provide clean 
electricity to neighbouring countries. 2.3GW will be added by 2020 and increase total 
hydropower electricity production to approximately 5.5GW by 2020. In addition, Lao 
PDR  has  over  20GW  of  additional  hydroelectricity  capacity  to  be  constructed  after 
2020. 
2015 
The estimate is based on the following assumptions: 
85%  of  the  hydropower  electricity  is  exported  to  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  1  MW 
generates 3.5 GWh and 1 GWh produces 3.6 TJ and the default emission factors is 
0.67 tonnes of CO2 per MWh . 
Note  that  this  is  a  preliminary  estimate  and  need  to  be  reviewed  and  updated  to 
address consistency and accuracy in analytical methods once more reliable data and 
information are available 
16,284 ktCO2 per annum, once the target is reached in 2020.

Main barriers for

Rural  communities  require  a  clean  and  secure  source  of  energy,  particularly  when 
there is no access to the electricity grid.  
 
By increasing the level of rural electrification, reliance on woodfuel and fossil fuels will 
be reduced. 
Lao PDR has set a target of making electricity available to 90% of the households by 
the year 2020. Electrification has already improved from a low of 15% in 1995 to 73% 
in 2010. 
 
2010 
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) on Rural Electrification in Lao PDR, 
produced with support by the UNDP lays out the plans for the implementation of the 
NAMA which will assist Laos to meet its goal of 90% electrification by 2020. 
 
The estimate of the emissions based on following assumption:  
90% or 1,108,609 households will be electrified by 2020. 60% of the household lives 
rural  area  and  consumes  on  average  30  litres  of  kerosene  and  diesel  per  year. 
Therefore the achievement of the rural electrification  goal  would reduce the use of 
kerosene and diesel about 19.95 million litres. With the use of default value for net 
calorific  value  and  emission  factors,  electrification  in  Lao  PDR  would  reduce  CO2 
emissions of about 63 ktCO2 per year.  
 
 Note  that  this  is  a  preliminary  estimate  and  need  to  be  reviewed  and  updated  to 
address consistency and accuracy in analytical methods once more reliable data and 
information are available 
 
 
63  ktCO2 per year 

Implementation of  nationally appropriate mitigation action (NAMA), with the support 
from  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  measures  on  rural 
electrification particularly  following five underlying concepts:  
*  Maintenance  and  expansion  of  power  supply  based  on  economic  efficiency, 
to  promote  economic  and  social 

in  order 

reliability,  and  sustainability, 
development 

*  Promotion of electric power development and expansion of electricity exports, in 

order to secure finances targeted by the government 

*  Development  and  strengthening  of  laws  and  regulations,  in  order  to  effectively 
develop  the  electricity  sector  through  the  government,  the  private  sector,  or 
partnerships between public and private sectors 
Increasing  the  nation's  capabilities,  while  developing  international-standard 
techniques, expertise, and experience 

* 

*  Achieving  sustainable  development  by  identifying  impacts  and  responsibilities 

related to society and environment. 

*  Limited  access,  scattering  resettlement  and  inexistence  of  integrated  rural 

infrastructure development plan 

*  Existing transmission networks are limited 
*  Limited finance for development of rural electricity systems 
*  Lack  of  comprehensive  policy  and  facilitation  to  access  to  finance  and  private 

sector investment.  
 

Support required  *  Capacity  building  and  financial  mechanism  for  access  to  finance  and  resource 

mobilization  

*  Financial  support  and  investment  in  electricity  grid  expansion,  system  and 

facilities.

the Goal 

Main barriers for 
implementation 

Systematic development of a road network and provision of buses to meet increasing 
demand  for  travel  will  mitigate  GHG  emissions  while  promoting  economic 
development. 
The  objective  of  road  network  development  is  to  provide  better  networks  so  that 
vehicle  kilometres  travelled  will  be  reduced  against  the  business  as  usual  (BAU) 
scenario. In addition to reduction in GHG emissions, the activity will lead to a reduction 
in  NOx  and  SOx  emissions  which  will  have  significant  co-benefits  such  as 
improvement in air quality which in turn has positive implications for human health. 
2007 
The reference scenario is determined as BAU which is the scenario reflecting traffic 
volume trends between 2007 and project start. The scenario is pre-determined and 
based  on  transport  demand  forecast  surveys  conducted  prior  to  the  project's 
implementation. 
 
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-supported NAMA document from 
which  projections  are  taken  employs  the  ASIF  (activity-structure-intensity-fuel) 
approach to calculate emission reductions ex-ante. 
 
A feasibility study for a JICA proposed NAMA estimates that emission reductions due 
to road network development is approximately 33 kt CO2e/pa, and emission reductions 
due to public transport development 158 kt CO2e/pa by against BAU by 2025, using 
2007 as a base year for comparison. 
 
The  actions  are  to  be  completed  as  part  of  a  NAMA.  Projects  in  road  network 
development, public transport development and transport management sectors are 
planned to be implemented in three phases; short, medium and long term.  
 
 
*  Uncertain or unclear carbon market and mitigation incentives; 
*  Limited budget for road network and transport system improvement;  
*  Existing  road  network  is  rather  complicated  and  it  has  not  been  integrated 

Support required  *  Capacity building on:
