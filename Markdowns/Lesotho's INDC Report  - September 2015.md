<meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8'>Foreword 

The Lima Call for Climate Action (Decision 1/CP.20)1 reiterated the invitation to all Parties to develop and 

communicate  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (INDC)  as  their  ‘contributions'  toward 

achieving  the  ultimate  objective  of  Article  2  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  Climate  Change 

(UNFCCC): "to achieve… stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that 

would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." Recognizing concerns about 

the legal nature of INDCs, the decision also noted that arrangements for INDC preparation and submission 

were "without prejudice to the legal nature and content of the intended nationally determined contributions 

of  Parties  or  to  the  content  of  the  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force 

under the Convention applicable to all Parties".  Further, the Twentieth Conference of the Parties (COP) in 

Lima  agreed  that  special  provisions  would  apply  to  Least  Developed  Countries  (LDCs)  and  Small  Islands 

Developing  States  (SIDS),  i.e.  that  their  INDCs  "may  communicate  information  on  strategies,  plans  and 

actions for low greenhouse gas emission development reflecting their special circumstances".  This means 

that  while  the  INDCs  of  developed  countries  are  expected  to  include  absolute  or  economy-wide  emission 

reduction  commitments,  LDCs  can  draw  on  specific  strategies,  plans  or  projects  to  formulate  their 

contributions,  and  specify  the  component  of  the  contribution  that  would  be  conditional  upon  receiving 

international finance or other support. 

 

It is against this backdrop of the foregoing that the Kingdom of Lesotho is herein submitting her Intended 

Nationally  Developed  Contributions.    This  report  followed  a  series  of  intensive  national  consultations,  on 

the nature of our development trajectory between 2020 and 2030 and the potential greenhouse gas emissions 

reductions.    However,  cognizant  to  the  fact  that  Lesotho  is  highly  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  climate 

change, it has thus also reported on adaptation in line with the collective position of the Africa Group. 

 

Thus, this report is a summary of our national mitigation and adaptation contributions.

3  National Development Goals and Priorities, Climate Change Context 
 
In the  year 2000, Lesotho adopted a Vision 2020 statement to guide all development goals, objectives and 
aspirations in the medium and long term.  The vision statement overlapped with Lesotho accession into the 
Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).    Two  key  strategies  were  in  particular  aimed  at  fulfilling  the 
Vision  2020  pronouncements.    The  first  of  these  was  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (PRS)  2005-2007 
which sought to reduce poverty from 56.6% in the base year of 2003 to 29% at the end of the plan period.  
The  second  was  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP):2012-2017  which  embraced  the  key 
poverty  targets  of  the  PRS  while  seeking  to,  hence  forth,  consolidate  all  development  goals  with  an 

associated Public Sector Investment Programme for the plan period.   

 
In addition, a number of sector specific policies were adopted pursuant to the aspirations of the NSDP.   The 
Lesotho  Energy  Policy  2015  envisions  that  energy  shall  be  universally  accessible  and  affordable  in  a 
sustainable manner, with minimal negative impact on the environment and sets goals to reduce in particular 
fuelwood usage in the national energy consumption including other fossil fuels.  The policy further provides 
for mitigation of climate change, through energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy.  The Draft 
Strategic  Plan  for  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Meteorology  (2015/16  to  2020/21)  projects  key  strategic 
intentions in both climate change mitigation and adaptation including national energy initiatives.   National 
Rangelands  Management  Policy  2013  seeks  to  guide  range  and  natural  resources  management  in  the 
Kingdom.    Lesotho  has  formally  committed  with  support  from  the  European  Union,  to  a  process  of 
developing a new National Climate Change Policy and Sustainable Energy Policy.  

 

4  Adaptation Contribution 

4.1  Rationale and Process for Developing INDCs on Adaptation 
 
Climate change is already impacting on Lesotho hence robust integrated policies and strategies are required 
to  improve  the  adaptive  capacity  of  Kingdom.  Lesotho  has  a  high  exposure  to  climate  variability  and 
extremes which are  expected to  increase in  frequency and intensity in the future.    A sectoral  vulnerability 
assessment  to  climate  change  was  carried  out  on  key  sectors:  agriculture,  water  resources,  forestry, 
rangelands, and health. Subsequently a National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) was developed 
in 2007 outlining future adaptation needs to address projected climatic changes.  

 

4.2     Summary of Climate Change Trends 

The  trend  analysis  of  temperature  over  most  areas  in  Lesotho  (Fig.  1)  show  increases  in  both  annual 
maximum  and  minimum  temperatures  between  1968  and  2006  with  minimum  temperatures  warming 
more than the maximum temperatures with the most rapid warming in the early 1980s.

In the 1997/98, GCM simulations of future (2030, 2050 and 2075 relative to 1961-1990) climate change 
scenarios were generated using an ensemble of six GCMs. More recent climate change simulations show 
temperatures  increasing  by  about  1  °C  by  2030,  1.5-2.0  °C  by  2050,  and  by  about  2.5-3.5  °C  by  the 
2080s while winter rainfall shows strong decreases, with no change in summer and autumn rainfall, and 
gradually  increasing  spring  rainfall  (Dejene  et  al.,  2011)2.      In  summary  the  following  climate  change 
projections appear likely for Lesotho: an increase in annual mean temperature of approximately 1.0 °C 
(2030), 2.0 °C (2050) and 3.5 °C (2080) is likely; a moderate drying in late autumn/winter is expected 
and moderate increases in spring/summer rainfall, with stronger spring/summer wetting towards the end 
of the century. 

 

4.3   Reporting on Long - and Near- Term Adaptation Visions, Goals and Targets 
 
Climate change could well undermine national efforts to attain all goals encapsulated in the National Vision 
2020  statement  and  erode  achievements  that  have  already  been  attained  over  the  last  few  decades,  and 
undermine poverty reduction efforts.   Lesotho does not have an officially expressed medium to long term 
national adaptation plan to climate change.   However, our aspirations are expressed explicitly or implicitly 
in  all policy documents,  and NSDP.  The  apparent  national  adaptation  goal (s) towards 2030 embraces  all 
tenets of the MDGs which seek to reduce and /or facilitate national resiliency against climate change shocks 
especially  production  decline  leading  to  food  insecurity;  gender  vulnerabilities  to  climate-change-related 
impacts  especially  natural  resources  e.g.  declining  quantity  and  quality  of  drinking  water;  environmental 
degradation;  erosion  of  basic  support  systems  for  majority  of  livelihoods.    These  are  implicit  aspects  of  a 
long term national adaptation vision to be refined in the national adaptation plan in the pipeline. 
 
The government of Lesotho has over the last 20 years invested heavily in tree planting and small woodlot 
reserves.    Pursuant  to  this  policy,  the  Forestry  Act  of  1998  was  promulgated  and  a  new  National  Forest 
Policy was launched in 2008 to pursue sustainable forest management;  poverty reduction strategy through

4.4  Reporting on Current and Planned Adaptation Undertakings and Support 
 
In the absence of  an official national  adaptation  plan, the NAPA options  remain the best  indication of the 
nation intentions for adaptation (Table 1).

portion  of  the  budget  sourced  from  development  partners  but  the  distribution  shows  that  government  of 
Lesotho pays its equitable share of adaptation costs (Table 2). The government co-financing of donor funded 
projects is mainly through in-kind contribution.

4.5  Gaps and Barriers 
 
To  achieve  national  resiliency  to  climate  change,  the  NSDP  has  outlined  the  following  strategies:  i) 
Integrating  of  climate  change  into  sectoral  plans  and  programmes;  ii)  Climate  proofing  investments  by 
upgrading  standards  for  infrastructure  development;  iii)  Improving  access  to  climate  change  adaptation 

technology  and  use;  iv)  Improving  environmental  and  climate  change  governance  through  undertaking 
vulnerability  assessments  and  utilising  them  for  medium  to  long-term  forecasting,  policy  and  planning.  
Despite  these  noble  aspirations,  the  country  currently  does  not  have  a  long  term  national  adaptation  plan. 
Thus  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  financial  support  to  complement  the  on-going  processes  of  policy 
development by taking the process further to the development of an adaptation plan and research. 

Specific barriers to adaptation in Lesotho are: 

  Technological:  Lack  of  tools  and  techniques  may  hinder  adaptation  to  climate  change.  National 
research capacity to build basic dataset and technical analysis /publication is a critical component of 
the technology /capacity barriers in Lesotho;  

  Economic and financial:  The urgency of adaptation is felt by rural low income subsistence farming 
households  and  communities.  In  Lesotho,  this  is  expressed  by  lack  of  financial  capital  to  finance 
adaptation technologies such as improved crop varieties and diversification of livelihoods.   

  Institutional:  In  Lesotho,  commons  institutions  restrict  the  choice  of  livelihood  strategies  by 

favouring some groups over others such as those who own livestock and those who do not.   

 

4.6  Summary of Needs 
For  Lesotho  to  adaptation  there  is  urgent  need  for  provision  of  finance,  capacity  building  and  technology. 
These  also  underscore  the  need  for  research  support  in  climate  change  adaptation.    Sectorally,  there  is  an 
inadequate adaptation capabilities in the sectors such as Energy, Agriculture, Land Use, Land Use Changes 
and Forestry,  Health, Water and in the aspects  of data collection, processing and provision  by the sectors. 
Consequently, there is need to:  
 

  build capacity of experts and stakeholders in the preparation, data collection to enhance information 
management,  ownership,  information  exchange,  dissemination  and  information  sharing  within  and 
across sectors;   

  create systemic enabling working environment for the implementation of climate change activities  in 
relation to institutional arrangements, performance management and reporting  to ascertain roles and 
responsibilities, political will, ownership and empowerment, decision making and  service delivery; 

  Develop a database for reporting raw data which will take into consideration IPCC requirements by 
carrying  out  new  studies  to  upgrade  the  datasets  and  then  make  use  of  remotely  sensed  data  and 
training on GIS.   

  Obtain  data  from  satellite/remote  sensing  e.g.  land  cover  data  and  then  design  consistent  reporting 

formats of the reports. 

  coordinate data pools  to establish data archiving and sharing protocols; 
  Support research in climate change. 

 

4.7  Monitoring and Evaluation 

Lesotho's climate change adaptation process will be monitored using the following indicators: Change in the 
level  of  vulnerability;  Number  of  people  benefiting  from  adaptation  activities;  Degree  of  integration  of 
climate  change  adaptation  into  sectoral  policies  and  plans;  Resources  spent  on  adaptation  to  reveal  the 
climate  relevant  share  of  the  total  public  expenditure  over  time.    However,  proper  implementation  of  the 
monitoring and evaluation commitment is conditional on enabling finance. 

4.8  Gender Imperatives of Climate Change Adaptation3 
Women  have  a  unique  relationship  with  natural  resources  which  render  them  more  vulnerable  to  climate 
change.  They  are  responsible  for  food  security  of  families  through  food  collection,  crop  production,  meal 
preparation,  and  often  through  cultivation  techniques.  One  of  Lesotho's  unique  features  is  women's 
dominance  in  piggery  and  poultry  farming,  and  this  role  creates  an  added  vulnerability  to  climate  change, 
due  to  their  economic  dependence  on  these  industries. With  responsibilities  within  the  household,  such  as 
child-rearing, domestic management and meal preparation, women often work longer hours and any added 
challenges  such  as  those  imposed  by  climate  change,  will  increase  their  vulnerability  and  workload. 
Therefore, climate change adaptation interventions need to include measures to reduce women's workload. 

In Lesotho the formative years of the boy child are occupied by herding of livestock to the detriment of their 
education.  Climate change will particularly affect them negatively as good grazing land is gradually pushed 
further away from the village by its compounding negative effects on natural resources.  In addition, extreme 
weather events like heavy snow will increase their risk of life in the remote cattle posts more than any other 
group in society.  

 

5  Mitigation Contribution 

5.1  Timeframe 
 
The timeframe for mitigation contribution goal is 2030. 
 

5.2  Type of Contribution by Sector 
 
Lesotho's  GHG  emissions  are  minimal  due  to  its  predominant  dependence  on  hydropower  with  a  grid 
emission  factor  is  0.0038  tCO2/GWh.    The  proportional  contribution  of  three  key  sectors  is  agriculture 
(63%),  energy  (31%)  and  waste  management  (6%).    This  reflect  a  picture  of  Lesotho's  socio-economic 
circumstances: an economy dependent on natural resources, a low but growing energy sector and industrial 
sector that is still in its infancy. 
 
 

5.2.1  The Energy Sector 

 

 

Emissions from energy sector make a total of 1,079.43 Gg CO2eq mostly from residential fuel combustion 
(51%) followed by combustion of liquid fossil fuels in the transport subsector (29%).   Residential emissions 
emanate  from  the  use  of  biomass,  coal,  Liquid  Petroleum  Gas  (LPG)  and  paraffin.  CO2  is  the  major 
contributor, making about  75% of total  sectoral  emissions.  Energy sector emissions showed a  consistently 
increasing trend reaching 30% between 1994 and 2000.   
 

5.2.2  The Agriculture Sector 

 

Emissions  from  the  agriculture  sector  make  a  total  of  2,230.43Gg  CO2e  (Fig.  3).    Nitrous  Oxide  (N2O) 
emissions  are  the  largest  GHG  (61.6%)  of  the  total  emissions.  Other  emissions  are  Methane  (CH4)  from 
enteric  fermentation  of  domestic  livestock  and  manure  management  from  domestic  livestock  (37%).  Crop 
production  is  expected  to  increase  between  2014  (114,  804  Mg)  and  2030  (250,000  Mg)  primarily  due 
increased  intensive  crop  production  systems  and  increased  use  of  inorganic  fertilizers.  In  2012,  Lesotho

imported  more  than  9,000  Mg  of  nitrogen-based  chemical  fertilizers,  and  used  an  estimated  9,807  Mg  of 
organic fertilizers (96% Kraal manure). 

5.2.3  The Waste Sector 
 
The  waste  sector  in  Lesotho  is  divided  into  two  distinct  sectors;  the  solid  waste  management  (CH4 
emissions) and waste water handling (CH4 and N2O emissions). The sector was assessed for emissions from 
domestic, commercial and industrial waste. The total emissions from this sector are 199.63 Gg CO2eq over 
80%  of  the  CO2eq  emissions  is  methane.  The  bulk  of  these  emissions  are  from  industrial  waste  water 
handling. Overall, GHG emissions in this sector have doubled since 1994.  The sector emissions are driven 
by the increasing per capita solid waste generation among population especially in the urban areas. Deposal 
of  solid  waste  to  land  with  relatively  deeper  and  sanitary  landfill  sites  is  becoming  common  practice  in 
urban waste management. 
 

5.3  Mitigation Policy /Programs and Targets 

5.3.1  Energy Sector Mitigation Potentials 
The major assumption under the mitigation scenario in the energy sector is the implementation of Lesotho 
Energy  Policy  2015  and  Draft  Lesotho  Renewable  Energy  Policy  2013  which  seek  to  increase  energy 
efficiency significantly and shift the energy supply to more climate friendly technologies.  The energy sector 
will  require  additional  investment  of  about  USD  15  million  in  2020  and  USD  20  million  in  2030.  These 
investments will be needed in energy-efficient equipment, grid extension; rural electrification projects (off-
grids  and  mini-grids)  that  are  ultimately  expected  to  reduce  emissions  significantly.    However,  Lesotho 
cannot afford these levels of investment without financial support.

Furthermore  energy  efficiency  has  large  mitigation  potential  in  the  residential  sector.    Households 
commonly  use  incandescent  electric  bulbs  for  lighting.  Replacement  of  these  bulbs  with  Compact 
Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) can save as much as 80% of electricity used for lighting.  If 40,000 households 
are using electricity for lighting, and each installs two (2) CFLs replacing incandescent bulbs, the reduction 
potential in a CFL programme would be about 3,700 tCO2e per year based on an average saving of 50 kWh 
per bulb per year (using the SAPP grid emission factor of 0.92).  However, all this efforts are conditional to 
financial support. 
 

Buildings (Residential, Commercial and Institutional) Sector Mitigation Options & Targets 

Mitigation Policy /Program 

Targets & Assumptions 

  Promoting energy efficiency in buildings through 
targeted awareness-raising programs that seek to 
reduce demand in industrial, business, 
government and residential buildings  

  Phasing out of incandescent light bulbs 
  Installation of motion-sensor lights 
  Introduction of more energy-efficient stoves 

within households   

  Implementing incentives for retro-fitting of 

existing buildings with more energy-efficient 
appliances  

  Designing and implementing guidelines and/or 

standards and regulations for design of new 
buildings 

  Use of passive design and low carbon materials in 

building construction 

  To disseminate efficient stoves to reach a 

penetration rate of 30% in 2030; 

  To reduce progressively the use of wood for 

heating in order to reach 10% by 2030; 

  Replacement of fuel-wood with LPG at the rate 

of 10% a year from 2020 to 2030 

  Potential reduction of electricity demand in 

industrial sector from the year 2020 until 2030 by 
0.8% per annum (total of 8.0%); 

  Potential reduction of ﬁnal energy demand 

(electricity + petroleum products) in industrial 
sector by 1.0% per annum from 2020 until 2030 
(total of 10.0%) 

  Potential  reduction  of  electricity  demand  in 
commercial sector from the year 2020 until 2030 
by 0.8 % per annum (total of 8.0%) 

 
We also have significant albeit conditional emission reduction potential in the road transport sector.  Road 
transport  emissions  increased  by  approximately  2.5%  per  year  between  2000  and  2009.  Consumption  of 
petrol and diesel by road transport produced a total of 0.28 MtCO2eq in 2009. The main contributors were 
freight  transport  at  0.18  MtCO2eq  (64%)  and  passengers  transport  at  0.10MtCO2eq  (36%).  In  2000  road 
transport  contributed  29%  to  total  energy  emissions  and  8.99%  of  the  total  GHG  emissions.  In  2014, 
Lesotho  imported  225.3  million  litres  of  refined  oil  products  (diesel,  petrol  and  paraffin).  Emissions  from 
combustion of 225 million litres of diesel (or petrol) are about 90,000 tCO2e/year.  
 
The most promising  transport mitigation options  are vehicle efficiency, modal shift  from private to  public 
transportation, investments in fuel-efficient vehicles.  These measures will need to be driven by policies and 
must be enforced. In this scenario, the subsector will require additional investment to the tune of USD 1.5 
million in 2020 and USD 2.0 million in 2030. Limited transport planning and management has resulted in 
inadequate investment in infrastructure for non-motorized transport and pedestrian traffic. 
 

5.3.2  Waste Management Sector Mitigation Potentials 
The national dependence on agricultural wastes for energy is cause for concern significant health and GHG 
emissions.    There  are  approximately  310,000  households  in  Lesotho  dependent  on  small-scale  farming.  If 
20% of these rural households (approximately 60,000 households) had the sufficient number of livestock (3-
5 cattle) for installing a domestic biogas digester to generate gas for cooking, the traditional use of firewood 
could  be  reduced  (the  dung  from  two  cows  typically  suffices  to  meet  the  cooking  requirements  of  a 
household, Bajgain & Shakya (2005)). By using the suppressed demand method for this potential emissions 
reduction calculation, and assuming a daily use of 0.5 litres of paraffin for cooking, the potential reduction 
would be 60,000 households * 0.5 litres* 2.6 kgCO2/litre* 365 days/1000 = 29,200 tCO2/year. Construction 
of a 6 m3 bio-digester cost USD 1.800. Construction of 60,000 bio-digesters will cost USD 108 million. 
 

Waste Sector Mitigation Options and Targets 

Mitigation Policy/ Program

Development of infrastructure (e.g. collection systems, depots, and 
processing plants, etc.) to support recycling activities  
Design of incentives to promote recycling activities  

Construction of proper landfill sites in all 10 districts of Lesotho with 
methane recovery facilities 

Targets & Assumptions 
 
 
Introducing  targets  for  waste 
reduction (e.g. % of waste sent 
to landfill) and recycling 

 

  Development of a  national Waste Management Programme 

including e-Waste 

  Development of a well-integrated country Waste Management Plan 

 

5.3.3  Forestry Sector Mitigation Potentials 
Tree  planting  in  degraded  forest  lands  present  a  significant  potential  for  climate  change  mitigation  in 
Lesotho. According to the latest mapping inventory from 2012, the forested area of Lesotho is estimated to 
be  49,485  ha,  which  translates  to  approximately  1.6%  of  the  country's  area.  Lesotho's  forests  contain  2 
million  metric  tons  of  carbon  in  living  forest  biomass.  One  of  the  key  objectives  of  the  National  Forestry 
Policy  (2008)  is  to  increase  tree  cover  from  around  1%  to  at  least  5%  (152,000  ha)  by  the  year  2020. 
However, deforestation rate of 0.50% per year lead to loss of 200 ha between 1990 and 2010.  If this trend is 
reversed, it could potentially produce nearly 38,902 tCO2 of emission reductions for each area of 200 ha of 
tree  cover.  These  calculations  are  based  on  an  estimation  of  the  amount  of  carbon  stored  in  the  country's 
forests per year to 5tC/ha, and a conversion factor of 1 ton of biomass carbon to an equivalent of 3.67tCO2.  
 
Given,  that  biomass  consumption  remains  the  main  source  of  domestic  energy,  and  energy  in  small-scale 
commercial sectors, it will take a radical substitution of household fuel supply.  Such a fit would also require 
significant financial support to Lesotho towards to subsidize fuel-efficient cook stoves, and alternative fuels 
and techniques for cooking, which altogether might have a significant impact on GHG emissions. The cost 
of reforestation option would amount to USD 24 million between 2015 and 2030 for the 120,000 ha of land 
to  be  reforested  with  an  initial  establishment  cost  of  USD  200/ha.    Therefore,  the  mitigation  scenarios 
advanced for the forestry sector are conditional on financial support.   
 

5.4  Target Level 
The main opportunities for mitigation consist of energy efficiency and demand management, coupled with 
increasing  investment  in  a  renewable  energy  programme  in  the  electricity,  Buildings  (Residential, 
Commercial and Institutional) and Waste sectors. Lesotho is committed to reduce unconditionally 10% of its 
GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario.  The conditional target is 35% 
by 2030. 
 

5.5  Means of Implementation 

5.5.1  Domestically Financed Contributions 
 
In  the  period  2015-2030,  additional  investments  (relative  to  BAU  scenario)  needed  for  realization  of  the 
mitigation scenario are estimated at USD 1.2 billion, while for realization of the higher ambition mitigation 
scenario are estimated at USD1.8 billion.

5.5.2  Internationally Supported Contributions  
Lesotho  has  already  undertaken  several  actions  to  support  a  low  carbon  development  trajectory  including 
extensive  investigation  into  its  hydro  and  wind  power  potential,  embarking  on  rural  electrification  and 
afforestation  projects.    However,  Lesotho's  potential  to  contribute  to  global  mitigation  efforts  will  not  be 
realized without greater support from the international community. This includes not only financial support, 
but also technology transfer and help with capacity-building initiatives. The table below summarizes the key 
mitigation initiatives that would greatly enhance Lesotho's capacity in this regard.

5.5.3  Non-governmental Organizations 
Some NGOs are also investing in GHG mitigation projects.  These include: i) Initiatives on carbon trading 
promoted  by  SMARDT;  ii)  Save80  Stove  funded  by  Atmosfair  and  DHL  in  the  private  sector;  iii)  The 
Energy  and  Environment  Partnership  (EEP)  funded  project  -  Piloting  Implementation  of  Prefabricated 
Biogas Plants in Rural Areas in Lesotho under Technologies for Economic Development (TED) Lesotho; iv) 
Energy  Efficient  ISILIE  project  by  TED  under  GEF-SGP  funded  projects  -  The  goal  is  to  develop 
adaptation interventions to address the impacts of climate change and enhance the resilience of livelihoods 
and ecosystems in the highlands of Lesotho.  
 
EEP  promotes  renewable  energy  (RE),  energy  efficiency  (EE),  and  clean  technology  investments.  Jointly 
funded  with  €207,  900.00  by  the  Governments  of  Finland,  Austria  and  by  the  UK's  Department  for 
International Development (DFID), EEP projects aim to provide sustainable energy services to the poor and 
combat  climate  change,  demonstrate  high  innovation  in  delivering  energy  services,  facilitating  technology 
transfer, and encouraging cooperation and local stakeholders' participation.  
 
Technology  for  Economic  Development  (TED)  takes  the  institutional  project  lead  with  international, 
national  and  local  contacts  and  skills,  supported  by  the  Department  of  Energy  (Ministry  of  Energy, 
Meteorology and Water Affairs), and the Department of Environmental Health (Ministry of Health).  

 
The  University  of  Science  and  Technology  Beijing  (USTB),  China,  through  the  Centre  of  Sustainable 
Environmental Sanitation (CSES) contributes with a broad knowledge on biogas technology, prefabricated 
biogas  systems,  training  and  energetic  and  environmental  impact  analysis.  USTB-CSES  is  further 
cooperating with the Biogas committee of the China Association of Rural Energy Industry (CAREI), which 
develop standards for the Chinese rural energy market and certifies products being sold in the market. 
 

5.6  Sectors 
The  SNC  shows  that  three  major  sectors  account  for  the  emissions  burden  of  the  country.    These  are   
Energy  (including  transportation),  Agriculture  and  Waste  sector.    However,  in  the  SNC,  emissions  from 
forestry  and  other  land  uses,  as  well  as  in  industrial  processes  have  not  been  analysed  since  they  have  a 
relatively insignificant share in total GHG emissions. However, the in the future these will be monitored and 
analysed to establish the emerging trends with time. 

5.7  Gases 
Nitrous  Oxide  (N2O)  is  the  major  contributor  accounting  for  41%,  followed  by  methane  with  36%  of  the 
total  CO2eq  emissions.  Carbon  Dioxide  accounts  for  the  least  emissions  with  23%  of  the  total  emissions.  
Emissions of GHGs not listed are negligible but will still be monitored and reported.  Fluorinated gases are 
not covered since they are rarely used and their emissions are marginal. 
 

5.8  Accounting Methodologies 
GHG  inventories  based  on  IPCC  guidelines  and  methodologies  will  remain  the  foundation  of  emissions 
accounting  in  the  context  of  the  UNFCCC.    They  are  currently  reported  and  included  in  the  national 
communications.  In  future  they  will  be  reported  and  included  in  the  biannual  update  reports.      Lesotho 
considers the establishment of an international market mechanism vital to reduce the total costs to achieve 
the target  of limiting the temperature increase to  2°C. Thus the  country  remains open to  the  possibility of 
using  of  international  market-based  mechanisms  in  line  with  agreed  accounting  rules  to  achieve  its 
conditional and/or unconditional targets.  Reporting of GHG inventories and updates on mitigation actions 
and  goals  via  national  communications,  as  well  as  verification  of  this  information  via  in-depth  reviews, 
international assessment and review and international consultations Biennial updates to GHG inventory and 
reporting on mitigation actions will also be developed as part of the  Climate Change Policy and Response 
Strategy.   
 
Emissions from the Forestry sector will be tackled via (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation (REDD) initiatives. Lesotho intends to adopt the SADC REDD Strategy (2012 - 2015).  
 

5.9  Institutional Arrangements for Implementation 
The  Lesotho  Meteorological  Services  (LMS)  under  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Meteorology  the 
coordinating  agency  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  monitoring  and  reporting  on  weather,  climate  and 
climate change issues.  In addition, LMS is the focal point in the planning and co-ordination of activities for 
Lesotho's commitments under the UNFCCC.  A National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) was formally 
established in 2013 to effectively coordinate climate change issues in the country. The committee serves as 
an advisory body to the LMS.   
 

The  INDC  report  was  informed  by  a  broad  representation  of  experts  and  stakeholder  institutions  in  a 
national launching workshop.  Subsequently, the respective experts consulted broadly across governmental 
and non-governmental stakeholder institutions and expert informants.  The draft  mitigation and adaptation 

reports  were  subjected  to  a  one  day  validation  workshop  prior  to  consolidation  by  the  Lead  Expert.    The 
final summary report to the UNFCCC was endorsed by national stakeholders in a validation workshop and 
reviewed by an appointed international institution.  Subsequently the report was presented for endorsement 
by a relevant sub-committee of the National Assembly. 

5.10 Equity and Fairness 
Lesotho's  INDC  is  an  ambitious,  fair  and  responsible  contribution  to  global  efforts  toward  meeting  the 
objective of the UNFCCC with the goal of limiting global average temperature rise to below 2°C. Lesotho' 
proposed  targets  are  ambitious,  despite  its  status  as  a  very  vulnerable,  small,  landlocked  least  developed 
country  with  a  fragile  mountainous  ecosystem  and  numerous  pressing  social  and  economic  development 
needs  and  priorities.    We  submit  that  these  nationally  intended  contributions  are  fair  and  equitable 
commensurate to the national circumstances especially its low GDP per capita (≈ US$1,126) and the level of 
dependence  on  external  support.    Though  Lesotho's  GHG  emissions  represent  only  0.005%  of  global 
emissions  and  net  per  capita  emissions,  inclusive  of  all  sectors,  are  1.1  tCO2e,  it  is  highly  vulnerable  to 
climate  change,  particularly  in  the  agriculture,  energy  and  water  sectors  and  has  already  experienced 
extreme  weather  shifts.  Nevertheless,  Lesotho  is  a  responsible  party  committed  to  tackling  global  climate 
change  by  transforming  its  development  route  to  a  low  emissions  pathway,  which  requires  progressive 
decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth.
