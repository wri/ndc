INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 

 

Mexico is a country committed to address climate change, as demonstrated by the mitigation and 
adaptation actions undertaken over the last few years in a systematic way and  supported mainly 
with  national  resources.  In  the  international  arena,  Mexico  has  expressed  its  willingness  to 
achieve  a  legally  binding  agreement  with  the  participation  of  all  Parties  in  order  to  keep  the 
global average atmospheric temperature below 2oC.  

Since the year 2000, Mexico has published three National Strategies on Climate Change and in 
2009  adopted  its  first  Special  Program  on  Climate  Change.  In  addition,  Mexico  has  presented 
five  National  Communications  with  their  respective  greenhouse  gas  inventories  to  the  United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 

In April 2012, the Mexican Congress unanimously approved the General Law on Climate Change 
(LGCC in Spanish), which entered into force in October of that year and made Mexico the first 
developing country to have a comprehensive law on this subject.  

As a result of the implementation of this new LGCC, the country has established institutions and 
effective  instruments  to  reduce  greenhouse  gases  (GHG)  and  particle  emissions,  as  well  as  to 
increase the adaptive capacity of the country.  

Regarding  mitigation,  the  LGCC  sets  a  clear  obligation  to  give  priority  to  the  least  costly 
mitigation  actions,  that  at  the  same  time  derived  in  health  and  wellbeing  co-benefits  to  the 
Mexican  population.  For this reason,  both the  National  Strategy  on  Climate  Change  adopted  in 
June  2013  -  which  sets  the  vision  for  the  next  10,  20  and  40  years  -  as  well  as  the  Special 
Program  on  Climate  Change  (PECC  in  Spanish)  2014-2018  incorporate  greenhouse  gases  and 
particles, also known as Short Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs). 

The INDC that Mexico is submitting encompasses for mitigation purposes both the reduction of 
all GHG and SLCPs. 

SLCPs  have  an  important  Global  Warming  Potential  and  a  shorter  life  span  in  the  atmosphere 
than CO2. Actions to abate SLCPs simultaneously contribute to climate change mitigation in the 
near  term  and  to  the  immediate  improvement  of  air  quality,  as  well  as  to  generate  positive 
impacts on human health and ecosystems conservation; in consistence with the recommendations 
contained  in  the  5th  Assessment  Report  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change 
(IPCC), as well as with the guidelines of the Clean Air and Climate Coalition (CCAC) of which 
Mexico is a member. 

 
SECRETARÍA DE MEDIO AMBIENTE Y RECURSOS NATURALES SEMARNAT MÉXICO GOBIERNO DE LA REPÚBLICA For  Mexico,  the  inclusion  of  SLCPs  constitutes  an  increase  of  its  level  of  ambition  and 
commitment since it is additional to what the country has committed to previously. 

The  INDC  of  Mexico  has  two  components,  one  for  mitigation  and  another  one  related  to 
adaptation.  In  turn,  the  mitigation  portion  includes  two  types  of  measures:  unconditional  and 
conditional. The unconditional set of measures are those that Mexico will implement with its own 
resources, while the conditional actions are those that Mexico could develop if a new multilateral 
climate  regime  is  adopted  and  if  additional  resources  and  transfer  of  technology  are  available 
through international cooperation. This is unprecedented, since it is the first time Mexico assumes 
an unconditional international commitment to carry out certain mitigation actions. 

This INDC is consistent with Mexico´s pathway to reduce 50% of emissions by the year 2050, 
with respect to the year 2000, as mandated by the LGCC. 

In  presenting  its  INDC,  Mexico  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  combat  climate  change,  to  the 
multilateral  rules-based  climate  regime  that  requires  the  participation  of  all  countries,  and  to 
sustainable development, as well as its solidarity with the most vulnerable countries. 

Multiple  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  the  preparation  of  the  INDC,  including  non-
governmental organizations, academia and representatives from private industry of all economic 
sectors, through workshops and consultations at the national level.  

In  sum,  the  INDC  of  Mexico  is  ambitious  provided  that  for  the  first  time  it  translates  previous 
aspirational  commitments  into  mandatory  goals.  This  constitutes  a  considerable  increase  in  the 
level of ambition for a developing country with moderate levels of emissions. 
 
Unconditional Reduction  Mexico  is  committed  to  reduce  unconditionally  25%  of  its 
Greenhouse  Gases  and  Short  Lived  Climate  Pollutants  emissions 
(below  BAU)  for  the  year  2030.  This  commitment  implies  a 
reduction  of  22%  of  GHG  and  a  reduction  of  51%  of  Black 
Carbon1. 
 
This commitment implies a net emissions peak starting from 2026, 
decoupling  GHG  emissions  from  economic  growth:  emissions 
intensity per unit of GDP will reduce by around 40% from 2013 to 
2030. 
 
The  25%  reduction  commitment  expressed  above  could  increase 
up to a 40% in a conditional manner, subject to a global agreement 
addressing  important  topics  including  international  carbon  price, 
carbon  border  adjustments,  technical  cooperation,  access  to  low-
cost  financial  resources  and  technology  transfer,  all  at  a  scale 
commensurate to the challenge of global climate change. 
 
Within the same conditions, GHG reductions could increase up to 
36%, and Black Carbon reductions to 70% in 2030.

starting from 2013 (first year of applicability of Mexico´s General 
Climate Change Law) 
 
Mexico  includes  an  Adaptation  component  with  commitments  by 
2030  described  in  the  Annex  I  of  this  document.  The  priority  of 
these  actions  are:  the  protection  of  communities  from  adverse 
impacts  of climate  change,  such  as  extreme  hydro  meteorological 
events  related  to  global  changes  in  temperature;  as  well  as  the 
increment  in  the  resilience  of  strategic  infrastructure  and  of  the 
ecosystems that host national biodiversity. In order to reach those 
priorities Mexico will, inter alia, strengthen the adaptive capacity 
of at least by 50% the number of municipalities in the category of 
"most  vulnerable",  establish  early  warning  systems  and  risk 
management at every level of government and reach a rate of 0% 
deforestation  by  the  year  2030.  Some  of  the  adaptation  actions 
presented foster positive synergies with mitigation actions. 
 
Mexico  supports  its  INDC  in  a  robust  national  climate  change 
policy that includes, inter alia, the following instruments: 

*  General Climate Change Law. 2012 
*  National Strategy on Climate Change, 10-20-40 years. 2013  
*  Carbon tax.2014 
*  National Emissions and Emissions Reductions Registry. 2014 
*  Energy reform (laws and regulations). 2014 
*  Ongoing process for new set of standards and regulations 

 
The  elaboration  of  this  INDC  includes  a  public  participatory 
process  through  multiple  sectorial  meetings  and  a  web  based 
public survey. 
 
Mexico is a developing country, highly vulnerable to the effects of 
climate change. National emissions of GHG represents only 1.4% 
of global emissions and our net per capita emissions, inclusive of 
all sectors, are 5.9 tCO2e. 
 
Nevertheless, Mexico is a responsible party committed to tackling 
global  climate  change  by  transforming  its  development  route  to  a 
low emissions pathway, which requires progressive decoupling of 
carbon emissions from economic growth. 

 
 
Existing  commitments  adopted  by  Mexico  under  its  General 
Climate Change Law and presented to the UNFCCC are indicative 
and  aspirational,  subject  to  international  support  from  developed 
countries. 
 
The  INDC  submitted  by  Mexico  is  fair  and  ambitious  because  it 
includes  for  the  first  time  an  unconditional  GHG  mitigation 
commitment  of  22%  by  2030  that  increases  to  25%  reduction  by 
including  Black  Carbon,  a  well-known  Short-Lived  Climate 
Pollutant. The SLCPs reductions actions will be done with national 
resources,  in  an  unconditional  manner.  These  reductions  are 
additional to other mitigation actions.  
 
Further  ambition  is  reflected  in  the  efforts  of  the  Government  of 
Mexico  to  establish  synergies  between  adaptation  and  mitigation, 
using national resources. These actions not only help tackle global 
warming  and  reduce  social  and  ecosystem  vulnerability,  but  also 
promote inclusive green growth in the country. 
 
In  summary,  Mexico's  INDC  is  highly  ambitious  as  it  entails 
unconditional  and  transformational  investments  to  change  our 
patterns  of  production  and  consumption  and  achieve  peak  net 
emissions within the commitment period. 
 
These  policies  and  actions  include  a  cross-cutting  human  rights 
and  gender  perspective 
to  be 
implemented  to  take  into  account  women  as  important  decision 
makers  regarding  energy  consumption.  They  also  emphasize  the 
importance of implementing them such that they do not exacerbate 
the  impacts  of  climate  change  that  already  have  disproportionate 
adverse effects based solely on gender.

ANNEX I - ADAPTATION 

INTRODUCTION 

The  government  of  Mexico  considers  adaptation  to  climate  change  as  a  priority  to  reduce  the  country's 
vulnerability.  Furthermore,  there  are  opportunities  to  foster  mitigation  measures  and  actions  that  also 
increase  the  adaptive  capacity  of  its  population  as  well  as  its  natural  and  productive  systems.  This  is 
captured in the General Law on Climate Change, the National Strategy on Climate Change and the Special 
Program  on  Climate  Change  2014-2018,  which  describes  specific  actions  grouped  according  to  planning 
instruments; schemes and actions to protect, conserve and restore marine and terrestrial coastal ecosystems 
and their biodiversity; integral management of risk and sectorial vulnerability.  

At the subnational level, States and Municipalities have also embarked on adaptation efforts as reflected in 
their own Climate Change Plans. 

 

MEXICO'S VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE 

Mexico´s geographic characteristics make it a highly vulnerable country to the adverse  impacts of climate 
change.  Its  location  between  two  oceans,  as  well  as  its  latitude  and  topography  significantly  increase 
Mexico's exposure to extreme hydro meteorological events. 

In the last 50 years, Mexico has experienced changes in temperature and mean precipitation. The country 
has become warmer, with an average temperature increase greater than 0.85°C.  At the same time, Mexico 
has suffered an increased number of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts 
that have led to the loss of human lives as well as high social and economic costs. 

Under  various  climate  change  scenarios  for  Mexico,  there  are  projections  of  changes  in  the  mean  annual 
temperature  of  up  to  2°C  in  the  North  of  the  country  in  the  near  term  (2015-2039),  while  in  most  of  the 
territory  the  scenarios  project  a  range  of  1°C  to  1.5°C.  Regarding  annual  precipitation  reduction  is 
projected to be in a range of 10 to 20 % across the country.  

Furthermore  impacts  of  hydrometeorological  events  have  resulted  in  economic  losses  over  an  annual 
amount  of  730  million  pesos  (around  48  million  USD)  between  1980-1999  and  21,950  million  pesos 
(around 1.4 billion USD)2 for 2000 - 2012.   

In accordance to the PECC 2014-2018, in 2014 there were 319 Municipalities (13% of the total number of 
Municipalities in Mexico) highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change including droughts, 
floods and landslides. 

 

ADAPTATION ACTIONS IN MEXICO IN THE PERIOD 2020-2030 

The  adaptation  component  of  the  INDC  of  Mexico  was  elaborated  taking  into  account  a  gender  equality 
and  human  rights  approach.    As  stated  earlier,  it  prioritizes  synergies  between  mitigation  and  adaptation.  
The INDC includes concrete actions to be undertaken from 2020 to 2030 in the following three areas:  

1. Adaptation to climate change for the social sector 

Poverty is a determining  factor of social vulnerability in  Mexico.  Some estimates indicate that  up to 
60%  of  the  population  has  been  affected  at  some  point  by  natural  disasters,  coinciding  with  the 
percentage  of  population  living  in  poverty  and  extreme  poverty  in  the  country.  These  groups  inhabit 
precarious  housing  facilities  and  high-risks  areas  prone  to  climate  disasters  such  as  mountain 
landslides, cliffs or areas prone to flooding.  

Actions to be taken in order to reduce vulnerability  in this  sector for the period 2020  - 2030 are the 
following:

Guarantee food security and water access in light of growing climate threats through 
integral watershed management, biodiversity and land conservation.  
Ensure capacity building and participation of the society, local communities, indigenous 
peoples, women, men, youth, civil organizations and private sector in national and 
subnational climate change planning.  
Reduce the population´s vulnerability and increase its adaptive capacity through early 
warning systems, risk management, as well as hydrometeorological monitoring, at every 
level of government. 
Strengthen the adaptive capacity of the population through transparent and inclusive 
mechanisms of social participation, designed with a gender and human rights approach. 
Reduce vulnerability of the population through territorial planning tools and risk 
management such as the National Vulnerability Atlas and the National Risk Atlas.  
Invert the proportion of financing currently provided to hydrometeorological disasters 
attention by increasing the ones invested for disasters prevention.  
Prevent illnesses that are exacerbated by climate change through an early warning system 
with epidemiologic information.  
Reduce at least by 50% the number of municipalities in the category of "most 
vulnerable" in the PECC 2014-2018 and avoid any other Municipality falling into this 
category.  
Relocate irregular human settlements in zones prone to disasters through land use 
regulations. 

2. Ecosystem-Based Adaptation 

In  Mexico  there  is  a  large  diversity  of  ecosystems  that  provide  society  with  a  vast  amount  of 
environmental  services  such  as  carbon  sequestration,  provision  and  maintenance  of  water,  habitat 
conservation for the permanence of species, reduction of impacts caused by meteorological disasters, 
and the formation and maintenance of soils. These environmental services are seriously threatened by 
human activities and by the effects of climate change.  

Ecosystem-based adaptation consists of the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part 
of  an  integral  adaptation  strategy  to  assist  human  communities  to  adapt  to  the  adverse  effects  of 
climate change. 

Actions to be implemented for the period 2020 - 2030 on this topic are the following:

Reach a rate of 0% deforestation by the year 2030. 
Reforest high, medium and low watersheds with special attention to riparian zones and 
taking into account native species in the area.  
Conserve and restore ecosystems in order to increase ecological connectivity of all 
Natural Protected Areas and other conservation schemes, through biological corridors 
and sustainable productive activities. This approach will take into account the equitable 
participation of the population and will have a territorial approach.  
Substantially increase the Programs of Action and Conservation of Species in order to 
strengthen the protection of priority species from the negative impacts of climate change.  
Increase carbon capture and strengthen coastal protection with the implementation of a 
scheme of conservation and recovery of coastal and marine ecosystems such as coral 
reefs, mangroves, sea grass and dunes.  
Guarantee the integral management of water for its different uses (agriculture, ecological, 
urban, industrial and domestic).  

3. Adaptation of strategic infrastructure and productive systems 

Climate  change  poses  significant  challenges  in  terms  of  adaptation  of  productive  systems.  The 
characteristics  of  impacts  and  the  different  ways  of  dealing  with  them  will  depend  on  the  type  of 
system: agriculture and livestock, forestry,  wildlife use, aquaculture,  fisheries, industrial,  mining and 
tourism.  They  will  also  depend  on  the  risks  these  productive  systems  are  exposed  to.  In  each 
production  system  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  climate  change  aspects  to  increment  their 
productivity and competitiveness. 

 
Strategic  infrastructure,  including  communications,  transport,  tourism,  energy,  sanitation,  water  and 
waste  management,  is  vulnerable  to  the  effects  of  climate  change.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to 
incorporate  climate  change  criteria  as  part  of  its  design,  construction  and  throughout  its  useful  life 
span, in order to reduce its vulnerability and increment its resilience.  

Actions to be implemented for the period 2020 - 2030 on this topic are the following:  

Execute infrastructure relocation programs currently located in high-risk zones in priority 
tourism destinations and implement restoration actions of vacated locations.  
Incorporate adaptation criteria for public investment projects that include infrastructure 
construction and maintenance.  
Guarantee urban and industrial waste water treatment, ensuring quantity and good quality 
of water in human settlements larger than 500,000 inhabitants and to monitor their 
performance. 
Apply the norm on specifications for environmental protection and adaptation to the 
adverse effects of climate change in the planning, design, construction, operation and 
abandonment of tourism facilities in coastal ecosystems. 
Guarantee the security of dams and strategic hydraulic infrastructure, as well as 
communications and transportation strategic infrastructure. 
Strengthen the diversification of sustainable agriculture by conserving germplasm and 
native maize species, thermal comfort for livestock, development of agro-ecosystems, 
through the incorporation of climate criteria in agriculture programs.

CAPACITY BUILDING, TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCE FOR ADAPTATION 

The  implementation  of  the  abovementioned  adaptation  actions  for  the  period  2020  -  2030  requires  the 
continuous  development  and  strengthening  of  Mexico's  capacities.  Therefore,  it  is  imperative  to 
consolidate  platforms  for  the  exchange  of  knowledge  and  information  related  to  adaptation  at  the  three 
levels of government, as well as to strengthen the networks with academic institutions and civil society. 

Furthermore, it is fundamental to incorporate a gender and human rights approach into capacity building, 
prioritizing  the  most  vulnerable  sectors  and  regions  in  order  to  reduce  social  inequality  and  the  gap 
between women and men rights.  

Capacity  building  requires  both  cooperation  from  developed  countries  to  developing  countries  as  well  as 
south-south cooperation. 

Furthermore, Mexico requires international support for the development of its own technologies as well as 
for technology transfer and innovation to increase its adaptive capacity. 

For  Mexico,  the  increase  of  investment  in  disaster  prevention  is  of  utmost  relevance,  as  well  as  the 
development  of  an  insurance  market  against  hydrometeorological  and  catastrophic  risks,  in  which  the 
private sector is invited and expected to play a relevant role. 

The Mexican Government has identified a series of areas where technology transfer could be of benefit of 
the country for adaptation, including through:  

*  Access to information systems in order to monitor hydrometeorological events in real time and 

thus consolidate and enhance early warning systems.  

*  Availability of methods and tools to assess climate impacts, vulnerability and adaptation in 

specific sectors and regions. 

*  Water technologies for savings, recycling, capture, irrigation and sustainable management for 

agriculture purposes.  

*  Transportation technologies that are resilient to the adverse effects of climate change in particular 

for roads and massive transportation 

*  Technologies for the protection of coastal and river infrastructure.
