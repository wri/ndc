1.  Preamble 

 
The  Principality  of  Monaco  is  a  city  state  of  203  hectares.  Its  diversified  economy  is  based 
primarily  on  services,  construction,  tourism  and  the  banking  sector.  It  is  an  enclave  of  France, 
located 10 kilometres from the Italian border. 

 

The  topography  of  the  Principality  comprises  a  mountainous  cirque  dropping  down  to  the 
Mediterranean  Sea.  The  country's  entire  territory  is  urbanised,  and  forms  the  centre  of  an 
economic urban area which also includes neighbouring French towns. 

 

The  resident  population  is  37,000,  while  a  further  40,000  people  cross  the  border  every  day  to 
work in the Principality. 
 
Since  his  accession  in  2005,  H.S.H.  Prince  Albert  II  has  made  protecting  the  environment  a 
priority of his Government's policy, at both the national and international levels. 

 

The  Principality  of  Monaco  ratified  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) on 20 November 1992 and the Kyoto Protocol on 27 February 2006. 
 
Having signed up to Annex 1 of the Convention with a commitment to reduce emissions by 8% 
compared with 1990 during the first period of the Kyoto Protocol, the Principality has fulfilled 
its obligations, reducing emissions by 13.18% compared with 1990.1 

 

Monaco continued its commitment by agreeing to the Doha Amendment on 27 December 2013. 
The country's target for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce emissions by 22% 
on average over the period 2013-2020. 

 

At  the  Climate  Summit  convened  by  the  Secretary-General  of  the  United  Nations  on  23 
September 2014, H.S.H. Prince Albert II recalled the target that the Principality of Monaco set 
itself to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020 and 80% by 2050, compared with 
the reference year, while achieving carbon neutrality by that date. 

 

Aware that the challenge of reducing emissions is very much a collective one, the Principality of 
Monaco would like to offer its full support to the joint effort. The country's hope is that through 
the commitment of all Parties, it will be possible to achieve the target consistent with restricting 
the average rise in global temperatures to less than 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels, and 
if possible, to less than 1.5°C.

2.  The Principality of Monaco's commitments as part of the future international 

climate regime 
  

2.1 The Principality of Monaco's quantified commitment 

 
With  a  view  to  the  adoption  of  a  legally  binding  agreement  in  Paris  in  December  2015,  the 
Principality of Monaco wishes to contribute to the joint effort by adopting a target to reduce its 
emissions by 50% by 2030, compared with the reference year of 1990.2 
 
The Principality of Monaco envisages that this commitment will be subject to a formal process 
similar to that used in the Kyoto Protocol. 
 
The country therefore proposes that its commitment been turned into a quantitative target, which 
could be envisaged over ten-year period, or two successive five-year periods.

Monaco's commitment 

Quantified  reduction  commitment  based  on  the  model  of  the 
two previous Kyoto periods. 

 
 
All sectors are covered (see details regarding forests). 
 
 
All seven Kyoto gases will be covered. 
 
100% of national inventory emissions are covered.

2.3. Assumptions regarding international transfer of units 

 

The  Principality  of  Monaco  intends  to  achieve  its  emissions  reduction  target  by  implementing 
domestic  measures.  It  does  not,  however,  exclude  the  use  of  mechanisms  for  the  international 
transfer of reduction units  in  the event  that domestic emissions reductions prove insufficient  at 
the end of the commitment period. 

 

The proposed quantitative commitment therefore assumes that mechanisms for the international 
transfer of emissions reduction units will be available. 

 

To  this  end,  the  Principality  of  Monaco  supports  the  adoption  of  regulations  which  will 
guarantee  the  real,  additional,  permanent  and  verifiable  nature  of  net  emissions  reductions  or 
emissions  avoided  at  the  source  of  transferable  units.  The  country  is  committed  to  using  only 
units which offer this type of guarantee. 

 

The Principality of Monaco is, in addition, in favour of limited use of international mechanisms 
to transfer units to achieve the Parties' targets. 

 

 

3.  Principality of Monaco action plan 

 
The main sources of emissions in the Principality of Monaco are road transport, waste-to-energy 
and heating and air conditioning in buildings. These three sources each account for nearly 30% 
of Monaco's emissions. The addition of emissions linked to fluorinated gases brings the figure to 
more than 98% of the Principality of Monaco's emissions. 

 

The Principality of Monaco has drawn up an action plan which takes account of this emissions 
profile and prioritises actions relating to the most important sources. 

 

With  regard  to  road  transport,  for  more  than  20  years  the  Principality  of  Monaco's  transport 
policy has been based on the following principles: 

Development of clean public transport 
Development of "soft" transport options (pedestrian footpaths, cycling) 
Development of electric vehicles 

* 
* 
* 

 

The Principality intends to strengthen its emissions reduction policy through balanced measures 
in each of these three areas. The pedestrian modal share for intra-urban journeys is already above 
50%.  The  policy  of  developing  mechanised  walkways,  escalators  and  lifts  should  reinforce 
people's instincts to travel on foot. The introduction of a dedicated public transport lane serving 
the length of the Principality is being studied. This should encourage journeys combining public 
transport and walking. 

 

Electric  and  hybrid  vehicles  currently  account  for  2.57%  of  all  cars  in  the  Principality  of 
Monaco.  Very  rapid  growth  in  sales  of  hybrid  and  electric  vehicles  was  recorded  at  the 
beginning of 2015. This is due to the availability of more attractive new models and the Prince's 
Government's incentive policy. 
 
The implementation of this incentive policy will be continued and adapted over the coming years 
to ensure that road transport will play its part in achieving the national emissions reduction target 
in the Principality. 

 

Principality of Monaco

With regard to waste-to-energy, the Principality of Monaco has had a tri-generation plant since 
1982, and this is due to be replaced soon. Reducing emissions from this source and from waste 
management more broadly is a priority for the Government. 

 

The focus  is  on both  technical  treatment  systems and defining  a new way  to  manage waste.  In 
this area, the technical choices made will have an impact on emissions for the next 30 years. The 
Government  has  launched  a  number  of  studies  on  this  subject,  some  of  which  are  currently 
underway. 

 

Emissions associated with buildings are the third major source of emissions in the Principality of 
Monaco.  Various  approaches  to  reducing  emissions  in  new  construction  and  in  old  buildings 
have been deployed and strengthened in recent years. 

 

Due  to  a  previous  acquisition,  the  Principality  of  Monaco  also  has  a  large  number  of  seawater 
heat  pumps,  which  constitute  an  important  energy  asset.  Nevertheless,  there  is  still  significant 
potential for limiting emissions and improving energy efficiency in existing buildings. 

 

As  part  of  its  efforts  to  achieve  its  emissions  targets  and  communicate  its  post-2020 
commitment,  the  Principality  of  Monaco  decided  to  define  a  reduction  strategy  for  buildings 
throughout the country. 

 

This  strategy  will  require  performance  and  energy  substitution  measures.  It  should  lead  to  the 
formulation  of  an  energy  master  plan  which  will  cover  supply,  energy  carriers  and  local 
production, with the long-term goal of carbon neutrality. 

 

 

4.  Adapting to climate change 

 

Meteorological and climate records for Monaco are available dating back to 1911. An analysis of 
data for the longest available consistent period has made it possible to go back to 1969 and has 
demonstrated  a  progressive  upward  trend  in  the  annual  temperature,  amounting  to  1.5°  over  a 
period of 45 years. 

 

Much more recently, studies on the impact of climate change began in 2013 with the analysis of 
local  climate  trends  (forecasts)  and  a  study  focusing  specifically  on  the  period  of  activity  of 
mosquitoes (aedes albopictus) and on changes in heating and cooling degree days. 

 

A vulnerability study aimed at defining an action plan for adapting to climate change in Monaco 
was launched in 2014. The study should be completed by the end of 2015. As part of this work, 
the  Principality  first  undertook  a  literature  review  to  consolidate  climate  forecasts  for  the  near 
term  (2021-2050)  and  the  long  term  (2071-2100).  A  summary  of  this  work  was  sent  to  the 
country's key stakeholders in the following areas:

The exhaustive work of analysing vulnerabilities and constructing an action plan is based on the 
involvement of these national stakeholders. 
The  adaptation  strategy  will  be  made  up  of  an  action  plan  accompanied  by  a  monitoring  and 
evaluation framework. 

 

The climate change vulnerability study also aims to feed into risk mapping work which is being 
carried  out  by  Monaco's  military  force  and  takes  into  account  the  unknown  factors  associated 
with human activities, covering both the climate and other telluric events. 
 

5.  Fairness and ambition of the contribution4 

 
 As part of its participation in the first period of the Kyoto Protocol, the Principality of Monaco 
undertook  a  range  of  mitigation  actions,  prioritising  those  with  the  most  promising  cost-
performance ratio (substituting gas for fuel oil, for example). 
 
The target of reducing emissions by 50% by 1990 means that simple performance improvements 
are no longer sufficient; energy transition in the construction industry and significant changes in 
waste treatment are required. These steps will necessitate the deployment of carbon-neutral type 
technologies,  which  have  reached  varying  levels  of  maturity.  They  are  often  little  used  and 
expensive. 
 
Thus, the approaches envisaged by the Principality of Monaco are ambitious. They will require 
significant  investment  on  the  part  of  the  Government  but  will  also  involve  individuals  and  the 
private sector, which will need to adapt to new regulations. 
  
These efforts should allow the Principality to achieve its emissions targets which are in line with 
the  IPCC  emissions  scenario5  enabling  the  temperature  rise  to  be  kept  below  two  degrees 
Celsius, with reductions of between 40% and 70% by 2050, compared with 2010. 
 
By  adopting  a  target  which  goes  beyond  the  reduction  requirements  stated  by  the  IPCC  at  the 
global  level  and  by  supporting  the  development  of  the  latest  technologies,  the  Principality  of 
Monaco  wishes  to  demonstrate  its  full  commitment  to  this  collective  process.  Despite  the  fact 
that  it  represents  only  a  small  proportion  of  global  emissions,  Monaco  has  the  capacity  to 
become  a  forerunner  in  the  deployment  of  innovative,  non-emitting  modes  of  transport  and 
energy  consumption,  and  to  support  innovative  waste  processing  techniques  and  the 
development of the circular economy. 

 

                                                 

4 In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 14 of Decision 1/CP.20, this section aims to provide information 
on the way in which the Principality of Monaco "considers that its intended nationally determined contribution is 
fair and ambitious, in light of its national circumstances, and how it contributes towards achieving the objective of 
the Convention."
