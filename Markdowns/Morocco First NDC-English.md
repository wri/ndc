NATIONALLY	DETERMINED	CONTRIBUTION	UNDER	THE	

UNFCCC	

Introduction	

	

Morocco's	National	Circumstances	

	

Morocco's	Nationally	Determined	Contribution	(NDC)	is	an	improved	version	of	the	
Intended	Nationally	Determined	Contribution	(INDC)	that	Morocco	presented	to	the	
United	Nations	Framework	Convention	on	Climate	Change	(UNFCCC)	on	June	5,	2015.	
Although	Morocco	is	responsible	for	only	a	small	share	of	the	problem	of	climate	change,	
it	developed	its	NDC	with	the	conviction	that	the	global	ambition	to	counter	the	effects	
of	climate	change	calls	for	a	commitment	from	all	parties	with	regard	to	mitigation	and	
adaptation,	 as	 well	 as	 means	 of	
implementation,	 cooperative	 approaches	 and	
transparency.	As	a	result,	in	compliance	with	Article	3	of	the	Paris	Agreement,	Morocco's	
NDC	presents	the	kingdom's	efforts	to	combat	climate	change	across	all	of	the	
aforementioned	themes.	
Located	on	the	southern	shore	of	the	Mediterranean,	at	the	gates	of	Europe	and	
northern	Africa,	Morocco	has	always	been	a	crossroads	of	civilizations.	In	recent	
decades,	Morocco	has	experienced	substantial	economic	and	social	development	within	
the	context	of	climate	change	that	has	an	impact	on	all	sectors.	Consequently,	the	
pressure	on	natural	resources	has	increased,	affecting	the	resilience	of	forest	
ecosystems	and	the	agriculture	sector,	particularly	because	of	water	scarcity.	Water	
availability	per	capita	was	over	three	times	higher	in	1960	(approximately	2,600	m3	per	
capita	per	year)	than	it	is	today	(approximately	700	m3	per	capita	per	year).	
Aware	of	this	situation,	Morocco	has	voluntarily	and	resolutely	engaged	in	a	process	to	
combat	global	warming,	progressively	outlining	its	own	vision	while	complying	with	
decisions	taken	collectively	at	the	international	level.		
This	political	will	is	today	embodied	by	the	kingdom's	2011	Constitution,	which	gave	it	a	
new	 impetus	by	enshrining	sustainable	development	as	a	right	for	all	citizens,	and	by	
instituting	new	instruments	of	democratic	governance,	a	condition	to	achieving	
sustainable	development	across	the	country.	This	political	will	is	further	enshrined	in	
the	Framework	Law	on	the	National	Charter	for	Environment	and	Sustainable	
Development	(NCESD),	which	asserts	"the	rights	and	duties	inherent	to	the	environment	
and	sustainable	development	accorded	to	natural	and	legal	persons	and	proclaims	these	

Make	its	territory	and	civilization	more	resilient	to	climate	change	while	ensuring	a	

rapid	transition	to	a	low-carbon	economy.

principles	to	be	respected	by	the	state,	local	authorities	and	public	institutions	and	
businesses."1	The	operationalization	of	the	charter	was	undertaken	through	the	
preparation	of	the	National	Strategy	for	Sustainable	Development	(NSSD),	which	will	
guide	the	actions	of	all	public	institutions	and	private	actors	in	furthering	social	and	
economic	development	that	is	both	sustainable	and	dynamic.	
Morocco's	NDC	finds	its	institutional	roots	in	the	NSSD	and	outlines	a	vision	of	Morocco	
in	2030.	As	a	result,	the	implementation	of	Morocco's	NDC	is	part	of	an	integrated	
approach	that	goes	beyond	climate	change,	to	include:		
•  Respect	for	human	rights	and	gender	equality,	as	enshrined	in	Morocco's	2011	
Constitution.	
•  Synergies	with	the	two	other	Rio	conventions,	which	aim	to	restore,	respect	and	
maintain	biological	diversity	and	the	integrated	management	of	water	resources	
and	sustainable	land	management	in	order	to	combat	desertification	and	land	
degradation.	
•  Alignment	of	actions	related	to	climate	change	with	the	UN's	Sustainable	
Development	Goals	(SDGs),	especially	goals	1,	6,	7,	8,	9,	11,	12,	13,	and	17.	
Implementation	of	the	advanced	regionalization	project	in	Morocco,	building	on	
integrated	 and	 participatory	 strategic	
land	 planning.	 This	 project	 will	
substantially	contribute	to	implementing	Morocco's	NDC	through	a	national	
vision	for	land	planning	that	promotes	regional	potentials	and	resources	along	
with	solidarity	between	regions.	
Morocco	has	the	conviction	that	significant	and	unprecedented	engagement	from	
Moroccan	actors	is	required,	notably	those	in	the	financial	sector	who	have	the	ability	to	
influence	investment	flows	and	their	peers	engaged	in	international	finance.		
To	promote	this	engagement	from	stakeholders	at	different	levels,	Morocco	has	
established	the	Moroccan	Competence	Centre	for	Climate	Change	(4C	Maroc),2	a	
capacity-building	and	information-sharing	platform	on	climate	change.	The	platform	is	
available	to	various	stakeholders	and	has	a	regional	and	African	outreach.	The	Mosaïcc	
portal3	was	also	established	as	a	result	of	a	partnership	between	national	and	
international	institutions.	The	portal	strives	to	build	capacity	around	adaptation	to	
climate	change	in	the	agricultural,	water	and	forestry	sectors.	The	4C	Maroc	and	the	
Mosaïcc	portals	will	be	the	drivers	of	this	engagement.

Development	Process	

In	developing	its	NDC,	Morocco	undertook	a	broad,	two-year	stakeholder	consultation	
process.	During	this	process,	Morocco	reviewed	the	policies	and	programs	that	are	being	
implemented	to	combat	global	warming	and	determined	how	ambitious	the	country	
wants	to	be	in	its	NDC.	
The	process	for	developing	its	INDC	culminated	in	a	national	conference,	held	on	June	2,	
2015,	in	Rabat	and	chaired	by	the	head	of	government,	to	officially	present	the	draft	
INDC	to	all	Moroccan	stakeholders.	Consultations	held	after	the	adoption	of	the	Paris	
Agreement	strengthened	the	foundations	of	the	NDC,	and	enabled	a	renewal	of	
stakeholder	engagement	by	ensuring	their	full	support	for	the	implementation	of	the	
commitments	included	in	the	present	document.

Morocco's	Commitment:	Key	Takeaways		
	Morocco,	moved	by	its	deeply	held	convictions	of	common	but	differentiated	
responsibility,	by	its	belief	in	a	common	human	destiny	and	its	commitment	to	
the	principle	of	equity,	strives	to	outline	the	path	to	a	global,	responsible	and	
fair	pledge	for	the	well-being	of	our	planet.	
	Owing	to	Morocco's	high	vulnerability	to	the	impacts	of	climate	change,	
Morocco	ought	to	first	minimize	the	risks	of	these	impacts	and	invest	in	
adaptation	compared	to	mitigation	actions.	Morocco	has	made	important	
strides	in	matters	of	adaptation	since	its	independence	in	1956.	Between	2005	
and	2010,	the	kingdom	dedicated	 64	 %	 of	 its	 total	 climate	 spending	 to	
adaptation	efforts,	a	value	equivalent	to	9	%	of	its	total	investment	spending.	
	The	proportion	of	Morocco's	national	budget	dedicated	to	adaptation	is	a	
testimony	to	the	scale	of	the	challenge	facing	Moroccan	society.	Efforts	will	
have	to	increase	over	the	coming	years	and	decades.	As	an	example,	Morocco	
forecasts	that,	between	2020	and	2030,	the	implementation	of	adaptation	
programs	will	cost	at	a	 minimum	 USD	 35	 billion	for	the	most	vulnerable	
sectors,	namely	water,	forestry	and	agriculture.	
	With	regards	to	mitigation,	Morocco's	GHG	emission	reduction	targets	will	be	
achieved	through	economy-wide	actions.	Coordination	of	mitigation	targets	
stemming	from	all	sectoral	strategies	and	all	action	plans	will	fall	under	the	
auspices	of	a	low-carbon	development	strategy,	which	is	currently	being	
drafted.	Numerous	sectors	will	be	addressed	by	these	plans	and	strategies,	
namely	energy,	agriculture,	transportation,	water,	waste,	forestry,	industry,	
housing	and	infrastructure.	
	Morocco	commits	to	reducing	its	GHG	emissions	by	42	%	below	business-
as-usual	(BAU)	levels	by	2030.	This	commitment	will	only	be	made	possible	if	
Morocco	gains	access	to	new	sources	of	finance	and	to	additional	support	
relative	to	support	received	in	recent	years.	This	commitment	leads	to	a	total	
reduction	of	527	million	tonnes	of	carbon	dioxide	equivalent	(Mt	CO2e)	
between	2020	and	2030.	The	total	cost	to	reach	this	goal	is	USD	50	billion,	of	
which	USD	24	billion	would	be	conditional	on	international	support	made	
available	through	new	climate	finance	mechanisms,	including	the	Green	
Climate	Fund	(GCF).

MITIGATION		

NATIONALLY	DETERMINED	CONTRIBUTION	RELATIVE	TO	

In	terms	of	mitigation,	Morocco	has	set	a	national	greenhouse	gas	(GHG)	emission	
reduction	target	of	42	%	below	BAU	emissions	by	2030,	which	can	only	be	reached	
under	the	condition	of	benefitting	from	substantial	support	from	the	international	
community.	Morocco	also	commits	to	an	unconditional	reduction	target	of	17	%	below	
BAU	levels	by	2030,	taking	into	account	reductions	in	Agriculture,	Forestry,	and	Other	
Land	Use	(AFOLU).	
These	GHG	emission	reduction	targets	will	be	achieved	by	measures	taken	in	all	sectors	
of	the	economy.	Coordination	of	mitigation	targets	stemming	from	all	sectoral	strategies	
and	all	action	plans	will	fall	under	the	auspices	of	a	low-carbon	development	strategy,	
which	is	currently	being	drafted.	Numerous	sectors	will	be	targeted	by	these	plans	and	
strategies,	namely	energy,	agriculture,	transportation,	water,	waste,	forestry,	industry,	
housing	and	infrastructure.	
Morocco's	GHG	mitigation	goals	rely	in	large	part	on	an	important	transformation	of	the	
country's	energy	sector.	This	transformation	is	driven	by	great	political	will.	It	aims	to	
reduce	the	country's	heavy	reliance	on	foreign	energy	sources	and	increase	the	share	of	
renewable	energy,	while	responding	to	growing	demand	for	energy	to	ensure	the	
socioeconomic	development	and	well-being	of	its	citizens.	The	primary	goals	that	
underlie	this	energy	transition	are	the	following:	
•  Reaching	over	52	%	of	installed	electricity	production	capacity	from	renewable	
sources	by	2030.	
•  Reducing	energy	consumption	by	15	%	by	2030.	
•  Substantially	reducing	public	fossil	fuel	subsidies,	building	on	reforms	already	
undertaken	in	recent	years.	
•  Substantially	increasing	the	use	of	natural	gas,	through	infrastructure	projects	
allowing	liquefied	natural	gas	imports.

Mitigation	Targets	
Unconditional	Target	 A	17	%	reduction	in	GHG	emissions	by	2030	compared	to	a	
BAU	scenario,	with	4	%	coming	from	AFOLU	actions.	
Without	AFOLU	actions,	the	reduction	target	is	13	%.	
Conditional	Target	
An	additional	reduction	of	25	%	achievable	under	certain	
conditions,	which	would	bring	the	total	GHG	reduction	to	
42	%	below	BAU	emission	levels	by	2030,	including	AFOLU	
actions.	Without	AFOLU	actions,	the	additional	reduction	
would	 be	 21	%,	 which	 would	 bring	 the	 conditional	
reduction	target	to	34	%		
Meeting	the	overall	target	of	42	%	requires	an	investment	
estimated	at	USD	50	billion	between	2010	and	2030.	
Meeting	the	conditional	component	of	the	target,	for	which	
costs	are	estimated	to	reach	USD	24	billion,	is	conditional	
upon	access	to	new	sources	of	finance	and	to	additional	
support,	compared	to	that	received	over	the	past	years.	
For	reference	and	planning	purposes	only,	Figure	1	and

Methodology	for	
Estimating	Emissions	
from	Agricultural,	
Forestry	and	other	
Land-Use	Sectors	

Estimating	Emissions	 The	2010	GHG	emissions	inventory,	as	well	as	BAU	and	
Methodology	for	
mitigation	scenarios,	were	completed	according	to	the	
revised	1996	IPCC	Guidelines.		
	The	BAU	and	mitigation	scenarios	were	developed	based	
on	data	from	the	National	Statistics	Directory,	on	data	on	
sectorial	activities	and	on	economic,	demographic	and	
sectoral	prospective	analyses.	
For	the	agriculture	and	forestry	sectors,	only	CO2	stored	in	
biomass	was	taken	into	account.		
	For	 the	 agricultural	 sector,	 GHG	 emissions	 and	 CO2	
sequestered	from	agroforestry	programs	and	development	
of	rangelands	included	in	the	Morocco	Green	Plan	(olive	
cultivation,	agroforestry	of	fruits,	citrus,	argon,	fruit	trees,	
palm	trees,	date	trees	and	development	of	rangelands)	are	
taken	into	account.	
	For	the	forestry	sector	and	other	land-use	sectors,	only	
GHG	emissions	and	CO2	sequestered	related	to	afforestation	
and	 reforestation	 actions,	
the	 development	 and	
management	of	silvopastoral	plans,	to	projects	countering	
silting,	improved	home	cook	stoves	and	the	management	of	
forestry	climate	risks	(for	example,	wildfires	and	forest	
health)	are	taken	into	account.	
In	recent	years,	Morocco	has	thoroughly	reformed	its	institutional,	legal	and	fiscal	
frameworks	to	enable	the	transition	to	a	green	economy.	A	good	example	of	a	fiscal	
reform	is	Morocco's	reduction	of	public	subsidies	to	electricity	and	different	petroleum	
products,	such	as	industrial	fuels	and	gasoline,	a	move	that	creates	a	more	attractive	
environment	for	investments	in	renewable	energy	and	the	rationing	of	energy	
consumption.	In	addition,	institutional	reform	is	underway,	which,	for	example,	expands	
the	mandate	of	the	Morocco	Agency	for	Solar	Energy	(MASEN)	to	include	the	
development	of	all	renewable	energy	from	all	sources.	
The	implementation	of	Morocco's	NDC	is	based	on	several	laws,	strategies	and	national	
action	plans,	including	the	low-carbon	development	strategy,	which	takes	its	targets	
from	the	NDC,	as	well	as	clear	and	ambitious	sectorial	targets	(see	Table	2).	For	
reference,	Annex	1	presents	the	portfolio	of	actions	used	to	estimate	Morocco's

all	sectors,	have	been	identified	to	define	the	mitigation	scenario	that	leads	to	the

and	the	maximization	of	merchandise	flows.	
•  Accelerate	GDP	growth	rate	by	increasing	value	added	
through	reducing	logistic	costs.	
•  Contribute	 to	 sustainable	 development	 by	 reducing	
disruptions	(e.g.,	reduction	of	the	number	of	tonnes	per	
kilometer	 by	 30	%	 and	 reducing	 traffic	 density	 on	
freeways	and	within	cities).

Morocco's	Vulnerability	to	Climate	Change	

Morocco	is	among	the	Mediterranean	and	African	regions	that	have	been	exposed	to	the	
impacts	of	climate	change	for	several	decades	now.	In	Morocco,	the	impacts	of	climate	
change	take	the	form	of	a	reduction	in	precipitation	and	snow	cover,	and	a	general	rise	
in	temperatures	across	the	country.		
Historically,	Morocco	went	through	20	years	of	drought	in	the	past	70	years,	which	
means	almost	one	third	of	that	period.	Studies	show	that	in	the	future,	Morocco	will	
become	more	arid	due	to	a	decrease	in	precipitation,	a	concurrent	temperature	increase,	
and	extreme	weather	events	occurring	with	higher	frequency.	Projections	show	that	the	
country's	decrease	in	precipitation	will	be	to	the	order	of	20	%	on	a	2050-time	horizon,	
with	a	greater	impact	in	semi-arid	plains.	Morocco's	Third	Communication	to	the	
UNFCCC,	 submitted	
in	 2016,	 offers	 an	 exhaustive	 status	 report	 of	 Morocco's	
vulnerability	to	climate	change,	and	of	the	adaptation	actions	underway.	
Morocco	is	very	vulnerable	to	climate	change,	due	to	its	geographical	location,	and	is	
prone	to	water	scarcity,	declining	agricultural	production,	desertification,	flooding	and	
rising	sea	levels.	Thanks	to	the	kingdom's	great	efforts	with	regards	to	human	
development,	poverty	in	all	forms	has	largely	been	eradicated	in	urban	centers	and	has	
been	greatly	reduced	in	rural	areas	due	to	an	increase	in	people's	living	standards	and	
efforts	to	reduce	social	disparities.	However,	these	efforts	are	at	risk	of	being	
counteracted	by	climate	change's	negative	impacts	on	the	domestic	economy	and	
communities,	including	in	rural	areas.	Thus,	for	Morocco,	adaptation	to	climate	change	is	
the	cornerstone	of	any	program	or	policy	on	sustainable	development.	Some	economic	
sectors	or	ecosystems	are	more	sensitive	than	others	to	climate	change,	namely	water,	
agriculture,	fisheries,	shorelines,	forestry	and	health.	For	other	sectors	and	ecosystems,	
a	shortcoming	of	readily	available	data	means	that	it	is	not	currently	available	to	provide	
a	detailed	description	of	their	sensitivities.		
In	Morocco,	water	sources	entirely	dependent	on	precipitation	are	very	vulnerable	to	
the	spatial	and	temporal	climate	variability,	as	well	as	climate	change.	Since	the	1980s,	
these	sources	have	faced	the	negative	impacts	of	climate	change	and	an	increase	in	
demand	from	resident	and	economic	sectors,	and	have	decreased	substantially	as	a	
result.	Morocco	is	one	of	the	countries	with	the	smallest	volume	of	water	per	capita.	
Water	potential	is	estimated	to	be	22	billion	m3	annually,	or	water	availability	that	is	
less	than	700	m3/capita/year,	for	a	population	of	33.9	million	people.	Despite	a	
considerable	 effort	
in	the	 construction	 of	 hydraulic	 structures	 and	 access	 to

unconventional	resources,	this	quantity	could	fall	to	500	m3	by	2030	due	to	the	impacts	
of	climate	change,	population	growth	and	a	growth	in	economic	activity.	Forecasts	
conducted	on	certain	water	basins	indicate	that	water	available	to	residents	will	
decrease	to	the	level	of	water	shortage	by	2050.	Water	sector	vulnerability	will	be	
affected	by	the	increasing	costs	of	action,	and	the	aging	and	deteriorating	quality	of	
surface	and	underground	resources.	Conventional	water	resources	will	no	longer	be	
enough	to	fulfill	the	needs	of	the	citizens	and	of	the	various	socioeconomic	sectors.	It	has	
become	necessary	for	Morocco	to	develop	unconventional	water	resources	(such	as	
water	desalination,	demineralization	of	brackish	water,	recycling	treated	wastewater	
and	harvesting	rainwater).	
Vulnerability	of	the	Agricultural	Sector	
The	agricultural	sector	is	a	central	part	of	the	Moroccan	economy,	having	contributed	
more	than	14	%	to	national	accounts	and	employed	over	39	%	of	the	country's	labor	
force	between	2008	and	2013.	A	large	part	of	lands	used	for	agriculture	are	not	
irrigated,	making	the	sector	vulnerable	to	climate	change.	Several	years	of	droughts	
spanning	over	the	last	decades	have	affected	the	agricultural	sector's	main	types	of	
crops	—	and	thus	the	economy	—	and	community	living	standards,	including	in	rural	
areas.	In	addition,	the	geographic	area	where	multiple	arboreal	species	used	for	
arboriculture	are	found	has	shrunk	as	a	result	of	increasing	temperatures.	Numerous	
studies	in	Morocco	have	found	that	climate	change	will	substantially	affect	irrigation	
capacities	and	crop	yields,	as	well	as	the	geographic	area	in	which	fruit	trees	and	crops	
important	for	food	security	can	grow.	Climate	change	will	hasten	the	degradation	of	
natural	resources	essential	to	agriculture,	notably	water,	soils	and	agricultural	
biodiversity.	In	addition,	rangelands,	which	cover	82	%	of	the	country's	arid	land,	are	
already	facing	a	degradation	of	plant	breeding	resources,	as	a	result	of	both	
anthropogenic	and	climate	factors.	This	increasing	desertification	is	having	a	negative	
impact	on	feedstock	levels.	Climate	change	is	expected	to	increase	the	desertification	of	
these	lands,	and	increase	degradation	and	accelerate	the	loss	of	yields	in	fragile,	
mountainous	areas,	in	oasis	ecosystems,	and	argan	trees,	which	are	already	in	decline.	
These	ecosystems	are	vital	to	subsistence	for	at-risk	populations,	the	protection	of	
natural	resources	and	the	fight	against	desertification.		
The	maritime	fisheries	sector	contributes	up	to	2.3	%	of	Morocco's	GDP	and	directly	or	
indirectly	employs	660,000	people.	It	sustains	3	million	people	and	makes	up	15	%	of	
total	Moroccan	exports,	or	59	%	of	agri-food	exports.	Despite	imprecise	predictions,	the	
sector	is	seen	as	one	of	the	most	vulnerable	to	climate	change.	The	vulnerability	stems	
from	"upwelling"	zones	(which	have	a	high	fish	density),	sensitivities	to	climate	change	
and	the	limited	economic	capacity	of	the	affected	communities.	Climate	change	presents	
additional	challenges,	direct	and	indirect,	to	ocean	and	coastal	ecosystems	that	are	often	
already	made	fragile	by	other	anthropogenic	effects.	The	consequences	of	climate	
change,	in	addition	to	human	activity,	will	affect	the	distribution	and	productivity	of	fish

stocks,	as	well	as	the	structure	and	productivity	of	certain	ecosystems	and	their	species'	
populations.	In	Morocco,	certain	impacts	of	climate	change,	coupled	with	the	
overexploitation	of	fisheries	resources,	are	already	visible	in	the	shift	of	mating	periods,	
the	migration	and	disappearance	of	certain	species,	the	rising	average	temperature	of	
marine	waters,	the	reduction	of	the	number	of	days	amenable	to	fishing	due	to	increases	
in	flooding	and	storms,	and	the	reduction	of	previously	very	abundant	stocks.		
Morocco	has	3,500	km	of	coastline	along	the	Atlantic	and	the	Mediterranean.	Climate	
change	will	lead	to	an	increase	in	flooding,	the	erosion	of	sand	coastlines,	and	loos	of	
coastal	biodiversity	and	marine	submersion.	Because	the	vast	majority	of	industrial,	
urban	and	tourist	activity	is	clustered	around	coastal	cities,	climate	change	could	
impede	 the	 country's	 socioeconomic	 development	 and	
lead	 to	 consequential	
environmental	impacts	in	the	absence	of	countervailing	measures.	Numerous	beaches	
along	both	the	Mediterranean	and	Atlantic	shorelines	have	already	faced	severe	erosion	
or	have	entirely	disappeared,	despite	measures	taken	by	public	powers.	Sea-level	rise	
may	submerge	half	of	the	land	area	of	beaches	by	2050	and	72	%	of	their	area	by	2100,	
and	187,400	people	could	be	affected	by	flooding	due	to	sea-level	rise.	
Vulnerability	of	the	Forestry	Sector	
Forest	ecosystems	serve	an	important	purpose	for	the	country	and	the	lives	of	
vulnerable	populations.	They	play	a	crucial	role	in	the	socioeconomic	development	of	
rural	and	mountain	areas,	including	some	of	the	most	remote	areas	of	the	country.	A	
great	anthropogenic	stress	is	induced	on	these	ecosystems,	a	stress	that	Morocco	strives	
to	bring	back	to	levels	cognizant	to	their	production	capacity,	through	a	participative	
approach	with	local	communities.	Forest	ecosystems	in	Morocco	are	already	witnessing	
the	impacts	of	climate	change,	such	as	the	sporadic	decay	of	certain	Middle	Atlas	cedar	
trees.	Other	imminent	risks	include	more	frequent	and	more	severe	wildfires,	and	
phytosanitary	problems	stemming	from	the	emergence	of	new	pests.	Climate	change	
will	have	an	impact	on	how	vibrant	and	dynamic	forest	ecosystems	are,	on	their	ability	
to	regenerate	and	to	adapt	to	regular	climate	fluctuations,	their	biodiversity	(both	of	
their	fauna	and	flora),	their	consistency,	and	their	spatial	distribution.	Climate	change	
will	also	induce	catastrophic	impacts	on	current	key	ecological	balances	knowing	that	
extremely	crucial	orographic	ranges	make	up	parts	of	the	country's	geography.	Climate	
change	will	increase	the	risk	that	the	surface	area	of	some	forest	ecosystems	(cedar	
trees,	cork	oak,	cypress	trees,	argan	trees,	and	others)	shrinks	and	makes	way	for	pre-
forest,	steppes,	and	desert	ecosystems,	which	will	have	concomitant	impacts	both	in	
terms	of	socioeconomic	dynamics	and	in	terms	losses	of	ecosystem	services.	
Vulnerability	to	climate	change	of	the	health	sector	is	explained	by	the	presence	of	
endemic	illnesses	such	as	malaria,	schistosomiasis,	typhoid	and	cholera,	likely	to	be	
made	worse	by	climate	change.	Even	though	resources	are	dedicated	to	combat	the	
spread	of	these	illnesses,	resurgence	as	a	result	of	the	impacts	of	climate	change	is

possible.	According	to	the	World	Health	Organization	(WHO),	climate	change	would	
increase	deaths	in	Morocco	by	250,000	annually	between	2030	and	2050	due	to	
malnutrition,	malaria,	diarrhea	and	heat-related	stress.	According	climate	change	
scenarios,	the	vector	capacity	of	the	dengue	virus	would	increase	from	0.29	to	0.33	in	
2070	relative	to	a	reference	value	of	0.22.	Diarrheal	deaths	attributed	to	climate	change	
in	children	15	and	under	would	reach	10.5	%,	or	1,600	deaths,	in	2030.	According	to	a	
high	GHG	emissions	scenario,	deaths	in	elderly	populations	as	a	result	of	heat	should	
reach	50	for	every	100,000	people	by	2080,	based	on	an	estimated	baseline	of	five	
deaths	for	every	100,000	people	between	1961	and	1990.	The	impacts	of	climate	change	
on	agriculture	will	also	disproportionally	impact	those	most	vulnerable	to	hunger	and	
malnutrition.	
	
Vulnerability	of	the	Tourism	Sector	
Morocco	is	world-class	destination,	owing	to	the	riches	of	its	heritage,	its	diverse	
landscape	and	its	proximity	to	Europe,	as	well	as	its	accommodation,	transport	and	
communications	facilities.	Tourism	represents	12	%	of	Morocco's	GDP,	and	is	a

Morocco,	covering	for	32	%	of	the	country's	trade	balance	deficit.	Through	Vision	2020,	
the	tourism	sector	is	striving	to	position	Morocco	as	a	benchmark	with	regards	to	
sustainable	development	across	the	Mediterranean	shorelines	by	targeting	three	areas:	
seaside	resorts,	culture	and	nature.	Nonetheless,	the	tourism	sector	faces	significant	
challenges	that	are	stemming	from	climate	change.	Mainly,	the	sector	is	anticipating	
strenuous	 circumstances	 with	 regards	 to	 water	 scarcity,	 decreasing	 snowcap,	
degradation	of	fragile	ecosystems,	vulnerability	of	seaside	infrastructure,	extreme	
weather	events	and	new	diseases	that	may	spread	due	to	rising	temperatures.

adaptation	policy	that	builds	resilience	for	all	of	its	population	and	its	economic	actors	

	Morocco	implements	a	sectoral	approach,	adapted	to	the	circumstances	and	specific	
features	of	the	territorial	entities:	mountain	regions,	the	coast,	oases,	agricultural	areas	
and	urban	areas.	Morocco's	ultimate	objectives	in	addressing	climate	change,	which	
must	also	resonate	with	the	international	community,	are:	
•  The	protection	of	populations,	through	a	risk-prevention	management	approach,	
linked	to	the	exodus	of	rural	populations	and	its	socioeconomic	consequences,	
particularly	in	the	most	vulnerable	areas	(coastal	zones,	mountainous	areas,	
regions	with	a	high	propensity	for	desertification,	and	oases).	This	approach

relies	on	an	observation-and-research	system	to	better	understand	current	and	
future	climate	risks.	
•  The	protection	of	natural	heritage,	biodiversity,	forestry	and	fishery	resources,	
through	an	ecosystem-based	adaptation	approach.	Morocco	commits	to	restoring	
ecosystems	and	strengthening	their	resilience,	to	combat	soil	erosion	and	
prevent	flooding.	
•  The	protection	of	climate-sensitive	production	systems,	such	as	agriculture	and	
tourism,	as	well	as	high-risk	infrastructure.	Because	water	resources	are	the	
most	constraining	factor	to	sustainable	economic	and	social	development	in	
Morocco,	the	kingdom	has	recently	developed	its	National	Water	Strategy	(NWS)	
and	its	National	Water	Plan	(NWP)	with	the	aim	to	improve	integrated	and	
appropriate	water	resource	management,	the	development	of	unconventional	
water	resources,	preservation	methods,	the	protection	against	pollution,	training,	
scientific	research	and	awareness	around	these	themes.	
•  The	protection	of	the	cultural	heritage	of	the	kingdom	through	education	and	
awareness	actions,	and	efforts	to	preserve	ancestral	good	practices	in	highly	
vulnerable	sectors,	such	as	water	and	agriculture.	
	
Morocco's	vision	for	adaptation	involves	several	quantified	sectorial	goals	for	2020	and	
2030,	presented	in	Table	3.	Even	though	Morocco	already	invests	heavily	in	adaptation,	
reaching	these	targets	will	only	be	possible	with	significant	support	from	the	
international	community	and	creditors.

	These	strategies,	plans,	programs	and	initiatives	set	in	motion	numerous	projects	
improving	adaptation	to	climate	change.	In	addition,	Morocco	is	currently	undergoing	a	
process	to	elaborate	its	National	Adaptation	Plan	(NAP),	and	more	broadly	its	NSSD,	to	
improve	its	climate	change	resilience	framework.	
Adaptation	needs	will	have	significant	budgetary	implications	for	Morocco,	for	all	
sectors	of	the	economy,	and	for	the	protection	of	human	and	animal	health.	Over	the	
period	2005-2010,	Morocco	devoted	64	%	of	all	climate-related	spending	in	the	country	
to	adaptation,	particularly	in	the	water	sector,	which	represents	9	%	of	overall	
investment	expenditures.	More	specifically,	investments	planned	to	achieve	the	desired	
targets	in	the	water,	agricultural	and	forestry	sectors	are	estimated	at	USD	2.5	billion.	
Securing	the	national	roadway	system	against	additional	climate	change-induced	floods	
would	cost	5	%	more	than	traditional	maintenance	costs.	
This	considerable	share	of	the	national	expenditures	budget	dedicated	to	adaptation	
demonstrates	the	magnitude	of	the	challenges	facing	Moroccan	society.	And	this	share	is

certain	to	rise	over	time.	Morocco	expects	to	dedicate	at	least	15	%	of	its	overall	
investment	budgets	to	adapt	to	the	impacts	of	climate	change.	
Between	2020	and	2030,	Morocco	estimates	that	the	cost	of	implementation	of	
adaptation	projects	for	the	water,	forestry	and	agriculture	sectors,	the	sectors	most	
vulnerable	to	climate	change,	will	at	a	minimum	reach	USD	35	billion.			
Morocco	is	currently	drafting	its	National	Adaptation	Plan,	which	will	present	and	
quantify	measures	for	the	adaptation	to	climate	change.	While	awaiting	the	final	plan,	
national	priorities	in	this	domain	can	be	summarized	as	such:	
Improving	knowledge	on	climate	change	and	the	impacts	of	climate	change,	
especially	with	regards	to	the	most	vulnerable	strategic	sectors.	
•  Conserving	water	resources	and	securing	water	supply	for	both	economic	sectors	
and	household	needs.	
•  Strengthening	food	security	through	natural	resource	conservation,	intensifying	
sustainable	agricultural	practices,	reducing	poverty	in	rural	areas,	and	tracking	
stocks	and	prices	on	food	commodities	on	international	markets.	
•  Conserving	fragile	ecosystems:	mountains,	oases,	the	argan	tree,	pastoral	lands,	
wetlands	and	coastal	areas.	
•  Protecting	coastal	areas	from	rising	sea	levels	in	order	to	safeguard	households,	
as	well	as	industrial	and	urban	infrastructure.	
•  Conserving	forest	resources	by	continuing	reforestation	efforts	and	fighting	
wildfires.	
•  Strengthening	adaptation	of	infrastructure	against	bad	weather	and	future	
weather	conditions.	
Improving	health	and	safety	of	the	population,	animals	and	crop	production	to	
protect	from	transmissible	illnesses	that	thrive	under	climate	change.	
•  Continuing	to	improve	the	institutional	and	regulatory	governance	frameworks	
addressing	climate	change,	as	well	as	ensuring	policies	are	consistent	across	
sectors.	
•  Building	capacity	with	regards	to	developing,	financing,	implementing	and	
monitoring	climate	change	adaptation	projects	at	the	institutional	and	local	levels	
(public,	private	and	partnerships).	
•  Promoting	scientific	research,	research	and	development,	innovation,	as	well	as	
technology	and	knowledge	transfer.	
•  Developing	early	warning	systems	for	climate	events,	and	agro-meteorological	
systems	for	forecasting	agricultural	production.	
Introducing	academic	curricula	specializing	in	climate	risk	and	climate	change	in	
training	and	learning	institutions.	
In	this	context,	Morocco	is	seeking	the	support	of	the	international	community	to	
implement	these	projects.	Beyond	financial	support,	Morocco	expects	to	benefit	from	
technical	and	institutional	capacity	building,	particularly	regarding	the	creation	of	data

and	knowledge	sharing.	It	also	expects	to	benefit	from	legal,	financial	and	engineering	
support	pertaining	to	designing	and	implementing	projects	at	the	regional	and	local	
levels,	as	well	as	for	the	monitoring	and	evaluation	of	their	socioeconomic	impacts.	
Morocco	has	put	in	place	a	system	to	monitor	and	assess	vulnerability	and	adaptation	to	
climate	change	that	aims	to	provide	the	country's	regions	with	an	institutional	
mechanism	to	monitor	climate	sensitivities	and	results	stemming	from	adaptation	
actions,	all	the	while	taking	gender	issues	into	account.	This	pilot	project	was	first	tested	
in	southern	Moroccan	regions.	The	adoption	of	the	monitoring	and	evaluation	system	by	
other	regions	is	planned	for	the	medium	term,	with	the	implementation	of	a	national	
governance	mechanism	to	oversee	the	monitoring	and	evaluation	system.
