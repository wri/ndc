  PAPUA NEW GUINEA 

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) 
Under the United Nations Framework Convention on 

Climate Change 

Summary 

Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  has  both  very  low  absolute  emissions  and  relatively  low  per  capita 
emissions.  The  nation  is,  however,  committed  to  also  be  a  responsible  global  citizen  contributes 
meaningfully to the reduction of global emissions by transitioning to a low carbon economy.  

PNG shares the deep concerns of its nearby Pacific Island neighbours in terms of existential threats 
to  some  of  the  more  vulnerable  low  lying  countries.  In  addition  there  are  the  same  existential 
threats to coastal and low lying areas of PNG itself. 

From a historical perspective, PNG's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been negligible and the 
state  of  the  economy  is  such  that  the  main  burden  for  any  mitigation  undertaken  by  the  country 
must be the responsibility of the developed countries that have been primarily responsible for the 
bulk of the world's emissions.  

The primary mitigation effort of PNG lies in reducing emissions from land use change and forestry. 
PNG can contribute to addressing the global mitigation gap by reducing deforestation and promoting 
forest  conservation  and  sustainable  management  of  its  forests.    The  main  forestry  effort  will  be 
coordinated though the existing REDD+ initiative. 

However, PNG ‘s current economic development is seeing a growth in fuel use therefore a big effort 
will be  to reduce  fossil fuel emissions in the electricity generation sector by transitioning as far as 
possible  to  using  renewable  energy.  The  target  in  this  respect  will  be  100%  renewable  energy  by 
2030, contingent  on  funding  being  made  available.  In  addition  PNG will  improve  energy efficiency 
sector wide and reduce emissions where  possible  in the transport and forestry sectors.    The main 
forestry effort will be coordinated though the existing REDD+ initiative. 

In summary PNG is committed to assist in  global mitigation efforts but the country's effort will be 
contingent  on  external,  adequate  and  predictable  funding  being  made  available.  In  addition  it  is 
likely that in the near term GHG emissions will need to rise with economic growth to enable severe 
developmental problems to be resolved. 

 
PNG's National Circumstances 
 
Papua New  Guinea  (PNG) is the eastern part of the world's second largest  island land mass in the 
tropical  West  Pacific.  It  is  one  of  the  more  undeveloped  regions  in  the  world  with  low  per  capita 
incomes and serious health and social problems. A large proportion of its 7 million plus population 
live a lifestyle that has remained little changed for millennia, with extremely low use of fossil fuels 
and GHG emissions. In the last decade or two the situation in PNG has been changing and there has 
been  considerable  physical  infrastructure  development  in  the  main  urban  areas  due  to  proceeds 
from  the  development  and  sale  of  the  country's  rich  natural  resources,  including  minerals  and  oil 
and gas. There have been, however, significant challenges in managing and utilizing these resources 
sustainably and ensuring that suitable sustainable development goals and plans are in place to guide 
the needs of the present without comprising the ability of the future generations to meet their own 
needs.  In  terms  of  climate  change,  the  growth  in  the  PNG  economy  has  produced  a  concurrent 
increase in GHG emissions, as also seen in countries the world over.  
 
National development goals and context 
 
In October 2009, the Government launched a 40 year development strategy: PNG Vision 2050. The 
intention  is  to  transform  the  nation's  mind-set  and attitude  and  align  the  people,  institutions  and 
systems  into  educated,  healthy  and  prosperous  society.  The  vision  stresses  the  importance  of 
engaging the community into the process of building a strategy for sustainable development for all. 
Vision 2050 is underpinned by seven Strategic Focus Areas:  
 

Institutional Development and Service Delivery; 

1.  Human Capital Development, Gender, Youth and People Empowerment; 
2.  Wealth Creation; 
3. 
4.  Security and International Relations; 
5.  Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change; 
6.  Spiritual, Cultural and Community Development; and 
7.  Strategic Planning, Integration and Control 

 
The  current  theme  of  this  new  development  road  map  is  to  shift  the  country's  socio-economic 
growth away from the current emissions-intensive growth strategy towards a more sustainable path 
that is able to leverage PNG's competitive advantages, natural wealth and significant human capital 
into the future. 
Foreign direct investment in the mining sector has increased significantly in recent years which have 
provided direct benefits including job opportunities to local Papua New Guineans. As the economy 
comes to rely more  heavily on resource extraction,  policies will  be put  in place  to  ensure  that the 
benefits  of  growth  are  shared  widely  to  reduce  poverty  and  regional  inequality,  and  promote 
sustainable development. 

In May 2015 the PNG Government passed the Climate Change Bill to become the first nation in the 
Pacific  region  to  implement  a  law  that  will,  among  other  things,  minimise  the  effects  of  climate 
change as a result of infrastructural development. 

PNG's Mitigation Contribution 

Existing National GHG Emissions and BAU projections of GHG emissions 

The mitigation options for PNG are based on previous reports including the draft Second National 
Communication to the UNFCCC (SNC), third party reports and various national development plans. 
The APEC energy supply and demand outlook 2009 gave the total primary energy supply in 2005 as a 
little under 2 MTOE which would give a CO2 emission level of around 6 Mt CO2 as of that year. 2010 

 
CO2eq  emissions  were  estimated  from  earlier  reports  including  the  draft  SNC  to  be  around  5  Mt 
tonnes (from a primary energy supply of 1.8MTOE) which would give a per capita emission level of 
around 0.7 tonnes compared to the world average of just under 6 tonnes. It is likely, however, that 
the  previous  PNG  figures  do  not  include  emissions  from  the  indigenous  oil  and  gas  production 
sector. The growth of this sector in recent years has produced additional emissions which are likely 
to  be  around  5  Mt  per  annum  (0.8  Mt  Oil  Search,  3.2  Mt  Exxon  Mobil,  and  1  Mt  other,  including 
mining) as of 2014. The total would give around 10 Mt CO2eq.  This would give per capita emissions 
(2014) of around 1.4 tonnes per person per year which is still low by world standards. As noted there 
is considerable uncertainty in these estimates as the figures given in the draft SNC are under revision 
for the final document.  
 
In addition, the draft SNC report reports the PNG forestry CO2 emissions (FOLU) as 413 Gg for 1994 
and 2199 Gg for 2010 or around 2 Mt for 2010. It was noted in the draft SNC that forestry removals 
are estimated to vary considerably from year to year. Due to the uncertainty in forestry emissions, 
waste  emission  and  agricultural  emissions  the  numbers  reported  in  this  INDC  document  do  not 
include  these  sectors.  Emissions  from  the  forestry  and  agriculture  sectors  are  expected  to  rise 
concurrently  to  national  economic  growth,  as  demand  increases  for  forest  and  agricultural 
commodities  -  fuelled  by  both  domestic  and  international  markets,  and  demands  of  the  rural 
populace put increasing demands on the forest for food, fodder, fuel and building materials. 
 
Gases considered 
 
The  paucity  of  reliable  data  at  the  present  time  regarding  emissions  suggests  that  PNG  limit  the 
gases considered to CO2 only, except for the indigenous oil and gas production sector where CH4 is 
also included in the industry calculations. 

 

Expected trajectory 

 

Projections of emission levels are difficult to make as they are likely to be dominated by changes in 
the  mining,  oil  and  gas  sectors.  Estimates  are  optimistic  in  terms  of  the  gas  sector  exporting  LNG 
with predictions of a doubling of capacity in the near future. LNG production is very energy intensive 
and will incur a concurrent increase in emissions. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 
"New gas exports (LNG) are forecast to drive a growth surge to 15.0% in 2015 that will subside to 
5.0% in 2016. In contrast with mining and petroleum, the rest of the Papua New Guinea economy is 
projected to grow by a more modest 4.0% in both years." 
 
Longer term national economic projections suggest emission increases at around the 3-4% level per 
annum, meaning that the 2014 emission level of 5 Mt per year could increase to around 8 Mt  per 
year by 2030.  A doubling of oil and gas sector emissions would produce some 10 Mt of additional 
CO2  eq.  emissions  by  the  same  date  but  the  actual  figure  would  depend  on  the  extent  of 
economically extractable oil and gas reserves, which are not well documented.  
 
Thus with BAU CO2 emissions in 2030 could reach 18 Mt CO2 per year (including CO2 eq in the oil and 
gas sector only).  
 
Assumptions and methods for establishing BAU emissions 

 

The method for establishing BAU emissions has included examining past reports including the draft 
SNC with cross checks to stakeholder information including Government and private sector sources.  

 

 

 
Mitigation opportunities  

Immediate mitigation opportunities for PNG are extremely limited if economic growth progresses at 
current  rates  and  the  oil  and  gas  sector  expands  as  anticipated,  other  than  in  the  forestry  sector 
through the implementation of REDD+ activities, in the context of adequate and predictable support. 
The  main  opportunities  exist  in  the  electricity  supply  sector,  energy  efficiency,  transport  and 
forestry. The key technologies for mitigation are renewable energy deployment technologies in the 
electricity  sector.  Considerable  assistance  will,  however,  be  needed  in  terms  of  human  resource 
development  and institutional support, technology transfer and capacity building  in order to carry 
out the mitigation measures.  

Electricity  supply:  PNG  has  a  number  of  opportunities  to  transfer  a  proportion  of  its  electricity 
generation  to  renewable  options.  In  this  regard  the  relatively  high  installed  capacity  of  hydro  of 
around 200MW presents itself as a large scale storage facility for intermittent renewable inputs to 
be  fed  to  the  main  Port  Moresby  grid.  In  addition  there  are  opportunities  for  additional  hydro 
throughout  the  country.  There  is  also  geothermal  potential,  with  56  MW  installed  (2010)  and  22 
TWh/annum possible, albeit mostly in remote areas. PNG also has considerable biomass resources 
although  there  are  indications  of  overexploitation  of  natural  forests  and  harvesting  of  these  will 
affect land use emissions in the forestry sector. Any final balance needed to achieve close to 100% 
renewables could be filled using solar PV. 

Energy  efficiency:  has  also  been  identified  as  a  relatively  low  cost  easily  implemented  option  but, 
however, one that has not been seriously implemented in the country for various reasons including 
financial  constraints.  Energy  efficiency  will  become  more  important  as  higher  cost  renewable 
resources are employed. 

Transport:  The  number  of  motor  vehicles  in  PNG  has  been  increasing  in  recent  years  along  with 
economic  development  in  the  main  urban  centres.  The  increasing  social  preference  for  individual 
transport is likely to limit mitigation options in the transport sector in the near future.  

Forestry:  PNG  has  extensive  forest  areas  which  present  opportunities  for  mitigation.  In  the  past 
rapid exploitation of these forests by uncontrolled logging and land use conversion to agriculture has 
produced increased FOLU emissions. PNG has been a global leader in the promotion of a mechanism 
to provide incentives to developing countries for the reduction of emissions from deforestation and 
forest  degradation through the  UNFCCC, and has been building national and regional capacities  to 
implement REDD+ activities since 2009. PNG is assessing its drivers of deforestation and will develop 
a national REDD+ strategy over the next two years that will including specific policies and measures 
to  implement  REDD+.  The  policies  and  measures  will  aim  to  reduced  emission  from  deforestation 
and forest degradation, as well as support sustainable management, conservation and enhancement 
of  forest  carbon  stocks,  thereby  leading  to  enhanced  removals  from  the  forestry  sector..  A  key 
current shortcoming is the lack of data on forestry emissions and removals, which is currently being 
addressed through national assessments of land use change and the implementation of a national 
forest  inventory.  Data  for  forestry  emissions  will  therefore  be  forthcoming  in  the  next  few  years, 
which  will  allow  a  more  accurate  estimation  of  the  potential  emissions  reductions  and  enhanced 
removals that PNG can achieve in its forestry sector through REDD+ implementation. 

Methodology and assumptions  

The methodology used for calculating emissions has been to identify the drivers of carbon emissions 
in  various  sectors  and  estimate  the  annual  GHG  emissions  from  each  activity.  In  accordance  with 
IPCC guidelines, emissions from shipping, aviation and the burning of fossil fuels that are exported 
have not been included.  
 

 
For future reports on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities, a net approach will 
be  used  (in  line  with  IPCC  guidelines).  PNG  will  be  using  the  IPCC  2006  guidelines  to  estimate 
emissions and removals for all sectors. 
 
In terms of  the methodology to estimate emissions into the future to obtain a BAU scenario to the 
year 2030 it can only be estimates in terms of existing economic and population  growth patterns. 
Population growth is high and around 2.7% pa. Economic growth is also high in the formal sector and 
dependant on the resource production sectors in mining and oil and gas.  
 
Options for Mitigation contribution for INDC 

Time frame for contribution  

Due to the lead times in terms of technology transfer, capacity building, infrastructure development 
required, modelling and detailed costing of projects a 2020 - 2030 timeframe is put forward.  

Mitigation contribution  

The main mitigation contribution for PNG would be in terms of an indicative replacement of fossil 
fuelled electricity generation with renewable energy sources. This could be accomplished at a rate 
determined by the availability of external funding.  
Due to the difficulty in accounting for actual emissions and the difficulty of large scale mitigation in 
the transport and land use sectors PNG will opt for a national target in the electricity sector in terms 
of becoming carbon free by a 2030 target date. This option has been explored both in official PNG 
Government policy and also by external third party reports such as the recent ANZ report (August 
2015).  In this regard there are many options in terms of PV, geothermal, biomass fuelled plants and 
additional hydro which could be investigated. Together these could make the country close to 100% 
renewable in the power sector. Longer term increases in energy consumption would, however, have 
to be restrained and ameliorated by extensive energy efficiency options. 
 
Energy  Efficiency  options:  Energy  efficiency  and  conservation  is  always  a  good  mitigation 
opportunity  but  would  require  external  funding  and  assistance.  Even  though  energy  conservation 
and the use of renewable energy may save money in the long term, higher up-front costs have often 
prevented their use in the past.   
 
Improve  data  gathering  and  human  resource  capability.  PNG  would  like  to  vigorously  pursue 
mitigation  options  in  the  future;  however,  considerable  assistance  will  be  needed  in  terms  of 
capacity  building  and  technology  transfer  for  emissions  data  collection  and  tracking  mitigation 
progress. Without improving national capacities in this area there is a high likelihood that regulation 
of the government and the private sector in terms of emissions will not be effective.  

Oil  and  Gas  sector:  This  sector  is  a  generator  of  jobs  and  national  economic  growth  and 
consequently considerable capital is being spent on developing this sector. Unfortunately the sector 
is responsible for considerable emissions and if the world does mitigate climate change seriously the 
production situation may change dramatically and the capital expended in the sector may become a 
stranded  asset.  While  this  change  is  unlikely  to  happen  before  2030,  if  the  world  does  follow 
mitigation strategies that reduce all fossil fuel use to zero, as required by IPCC AR5 RCP 2.6, there 
will of course be no market for hydrocarbons after 2050. 

Transport:  Transport  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  emitter  of  CO2  and  mitigation  needs  to  be 
seriously  addressed.  Options  include  improving  public  transport  by  introducing  energy  efficient 
busses  in  the  main  urban  centres,  and  the  future  introduction  of  infrastructure  for  more 
sophisticated modes of public transport, such as trains and trams.  

 
Forestry/land use: PNG will implement REDD+ activities under the UNFCCC to reduce emissions and 
enhance removals from this important sector, which PNG has set as a priority, as can be seen from 
its creation of a REDD+ Directorate within the Office for Climate Change and Development (OCCD). 
Extensive  capacity  building,  technology  transfer  and  technical  assistance  is  required  to  implement 
effective actions and ensure the collection of accurate data. 

Domestically financed contribution  

 

Little  domestic  finance  is  available  but  Government  assistance  will  be  provided  where  possible. 
Private  finance  could  be  made  available  especially  for  the  mining  and  oil  and  gas  sectors.  Energy 
efficiency initiatives could be encouraged by policy decisions.  
 
Internationally supported contributions  

 

The transition to renewable energy in the electricity sector thus would  need to be mostly financed 
from external sources. The first step would be to quantify the funding needed and work with PNG 
Power to finalise a plan that would fit into the existing main grids.  
 
Financing  for  the  implementation  of  REDD+  activities  under  the  UNFCCC  are  currently  being 
supported by the UN-REDD Programme, the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), 
and  the  European  Union.  These  lines  of  support  focus  on  REDD+  readiness  and  data  collection. 
Further  international  financial  support  will  be  required  for  effective  national  scale  REDD+ 
implementation. 
 
Means of Implementation for supported Mitigation Contribution 

 

The  GoPNG  has  the  Climate  Change  Act  to  implement  the  contribution  together  with  sectoral 
agencies  
 
Tracking and Monitoring Progress 

 

Sectors and gases covered- Electricity sector for targeted reductions. Forestry to be covered under 
REDD+, Gasses: Carbon Dioxide only.  
Accounting  Methods  for  tracking  the  mitigation  contribution  (e.g.,  for  economy  wide  reduction 
below BAU, based on GHG inventory developed using, say, tier II; for EE goal it would be approach to 
measure EE gains and estimation of GHG impact; etc.  
The GoPNG will use IPCC Guidelines and sectoral accounting methods to track contributions.  
The  greatest  challenge  in  terms  of  tracking  and  monitoring  progress  is  to  put  in  place  robust 
measures  for  data  collection.  Existing  systems  and  institutions  will  be  built  on  to  create  adequate 
national capacities for carrying out these tasks, if adequate and predictable support can be sourced 
to support these efforts. 
 
MRV approach for mitigation actions 

The national measurement, reporting and verification process in place will cater for the monitoring 
of the INDC activities.  

 

Equity and Ambition  

Papua  New  Guinea  is  a  developing  country  that  has  not  been  responsible  for  most  of  the  GHG 
emissions of the  world. In addition it  still faces  multiple development challenges.  Of the  country's 
approximately  7  million  people, over  90%  are  employed  in  the  informal  sector  and  live  an  almost 

 
entirely sustainable fossil fuel free existence. Domestic and international surveys reveal widespread 
illiteracy, malnutrition, poor health and vulnerability to natural hazards, many of which will become 
more salient with climate change.  In terms of equity PNG cannot be expected to mitigate out of its 
own resources and would need considerable international assistance.  

Adaptation  
 
While there is considerable attention in terms of mitigation to keep the world average temperature 
increase  below  2  degrees  Celsius  and  effort  in  the Pacific  Island  countries  to  limit  this  increase to 
below  1.5  degrees  Celsius  the  scientific  opinion  expressed  in  the  latest  2014  IPCC  AR5  reports 
suggests otherwise.  In this respect adaptation must be a high priority for PNG. 

The  natural  environment  already  poses  significant  risks  to  Papua  New  Guinea  today;  hazards  like 
coastal  flooding,  inland  flooding  and  droughts  take  a  severe  toll  on  the  people  and  the  economy. 
Climate  change    are  predicted  to  exacerbate  some  of  these  event-driven  hazards  and  may  also 
introduce  new  hazards  due  to  gradual  shifts  in  climatic  conditions  -  most  prominently,  increased 
malaria penetration in the highlands, changed agricultural yields and damaged coral reefs.  

Throughout the  country, natural disasters  driven by climatic conditions (i.e.,  excluding seismic and 
volcanic activity)  as well as gradual shifts  in climatic conditions disrupt  daily life, cause  damage  to 
assets and infrastructure, destroy livelihoods, endanger cultural and ecological treasures, and kill or 
injure people. Adaptation is included because it gives reports on specific activities, national projects, 
targets, objectives and goals on adaptation by identifying, coordinating and monitoring projects that 
supports  specific  adaptation  solutions  that  protect  people  against  the  risk  of  climate  change.  The 
government of Papua New Guinea through the Office of Climate Change and Development has put 
its emphasis on identifying the specific nine (9) hazards prevalent in Papua New Guinea. 

Inland Flooding 

1.  Coastal Flooding and Sea Level Rise 
2. 
3.  Food Insecurity caused by crop failures due to droughts and inland frosts 
4.  Cities and Climate Change 
5.  Climate Induced Migration 
6.  Damage to Coral Reefs 
7.  Malaria and Vector Borne Diseases 
8.  Water and Sanitation 
9.  Landslides 

 

In  the  National  Climate  Change  Development  Management  Policy  the  Adaptation  Strategies,  Risk 
Management has been prioritised and quantifying and prioritising hazards is one of the key activities 
of the strategies as given above. 

Summary of needs for adaptation  

In  summary  PNG  is  highly  vulnerable  to  the  effects  of  climate  change  and  given  the  temperature 
increases locked in by present world emissions of greenhouse gasses, adaptation is a high priority. 
The country will need financial support, capacity building and technical support to face the uncertain 
future posed by climate change.
