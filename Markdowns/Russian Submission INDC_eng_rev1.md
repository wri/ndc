The Russian Federation, recalling the statements of the Russian Federation at the 
UN Climate Summit in September 2014 and at the 20th Conference of the Parties to the 
UNFCCC in Lima in December 2014, as well as the Decision 1CP/.20 of the Conference 
Lima Call for Climate Action, i.e. para 13, which contains the invitation to all Parties to 
communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance of the 
twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (by the first quarter of 2015 by those 
Parties  ready  to  do  so),  presents  its  intended  nationally  determined  contribution 
(INDC) and clarifying information. 

However,  the  final  decision  of  the  Russian  Federation  on  the  INDC  in  the 
framework of the new climate agreement will be taken pursuant to the outcome of the 
negotiating process underway throughout the year of 2015 and the INDCs announced by 
major emitters of greenhouse gases. 

Limiting  anthropogenic  greenhouse  gases 
in 
Russia to 70-75% of 1990 levels by the year 2030 
might  be  a  long-term  indicator,  subject  to  the 
maximum possible account of absorbing capacity 
of forests. 
 
1990 
 
1 January 2020 — 31 December 2030 

Economy-wide,  in  particular,  as  determined  by 
decisions of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties 
on reporting:  
•  energy; 
• 
•  agriculture; 
• 
•  waste. 

land use, land-use change and forestry;  

industrial processes and products use; 

The INDC indicator is to be achieved with no use of 
international market mechanisms. 

 

The  INDC  includes  information  on  the  following 
GHGs:  

•  Carbon dioxide (СО2);  
•  Methane (СН4);  
•  Nitrous oxide (N2O);  
•  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); 
•  Perfluorocarbons (PFCs);  
•  Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6); 
•  Nitrous trifluoride (NF3).

The  Russian  Federation  currently  has  in  force 
legally-binding  instruments  aimed  at  providing  for 
limitation of the GHG emissions to at most 75% of 
1990  levels  by  the  year  2020  (Decree  of  the 
President of the Russian Federation of 30 September 
2013  and  Act  of  the  Government  of  the  Russian 
Federation  of  2  April  2014  No.  504-p).  These  acts 
provide, 
inter  alia,  for  organization  of  GHG 
emissions forecasting at the economy-wide scale and 
for  each  individual  sector.  The  Russian  Federation 
will  further  elaborate  and  adopt  legislative  and 
regulatory  acts  providing  for  achievement  of  the 
stated INDC target by 2030 based on the provisions 
of the Climate Doctrine and the Energy Strategy of 
the Russian Federation. 
 
Methodological  approaches  are  based  on  using  the 
following methodologies: 

•  IPCC 2006 Guidelines; 
•  IPCC 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods 
and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the 
Kyoto Protocol; 

•  IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement. 

The  Russian  Federation  will  use  global  warming 
potential  values  as  contained  in  Decision  24/CP.19 
of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties. 
 
GDP of the Russian Federation in 2012 amounted to 
172.9% of the 2000 level while the GHG emissions 
(without land use, land-use change and forestry) had 
reached only 111.8% of the 2000 level. Thus, as the 
GDP was growing significantly at that time period, 
the  increase  in  GHG  emissions  was  minimal.  The 
economic  growth  and  GHG  emissions  can  be 
definitively  decoupled  upon  achievement  of  the 
earlier  announced  indicator,  i.e.  limitation  of  the 
GHG emissions to at most 75% of 1990 levels by the 
year 2020, and the INDC announced for 2030. There 
will be GHG emissions reduction per GDP unit. At 
the same time, if contribution of the Russian forests 
is fully taken into account, limiting GHG emissions 
to 70-75% of 1990 levels by the year 2030 does not 
create  any  obstacles  for  social  and  economic 
development  and  corresponds  to  general  objectives 
of  the  land-use  and  sustainable  forest  management

policies,  raising  the  level  of  energy  efficiency, 
reducing  energy  intensity  of  the  economy  and 
increasing share of renewables in the Russian energy 
balance. 
Russian  boreal  forests  have  global  significance  for 
mitigating 
change,  protecting  water 
resources,  preventing  soil  erosion  and  conserving 
biodiversity on the planet. Russia accounts for 70% 
of  boreal  forests  and  25%  of  the  world's  forest 
resources. Rational use, protection, maintenance and 
forest reproduction, i.e. forest management, is one of 
the most important elements of the Russian policy to 
reduce GHG emissions. 

 

the  path  of 

Reducing  GHG  emissions  by  25-30%  from  1990 
levels by 2030 will allow the Russian Federation to 
step  on 
low-carbon  development 
compatible  with  the  long-term  objective  of  the 
increase  in  global  temperature  below  2  degrees 
Celsius. This objective can be achieved with efforts 
of all Parties of the future climate agreement.
