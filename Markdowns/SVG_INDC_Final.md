Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 

Communicated to the UNFCCC on November 18, 2015 

1.  The National Context 

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a multi-island nation consisting of 32 islands each with its 
own  characteristics.  It  is  located  in  the  Eastern  Caribbean  and  has  a  population  of 
approximately 110,000. St. Vincent is the largest of the 32 islands that comprise the nation, 
covering roughly 390 sq. km (150 sq. miles). The Grenadines extend 72 km (45 miles) to the 
southwest. The other inhabited islands, north to south, are Young Island, Bequia, Mustique, 
Canouan, Mayreau, Union Island, Palm Island, and Petit St. Vincent. The Government of St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines (GoSVG) ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1996 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2004. This INDC represents St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines' intention and has no legal  status. Any form of commitment is 
yet  to  be  decided,  pending  the  outcomes  of  the  21st  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the 
UNFCCC in Paris in December 2015. 

The  geography,  geology  and  socio-economic  circumstances  of  St.  Vincent  and  the 
Grenadines  make  it  extremely  vulnerable  to  climate-related  natural  disasters.  Due  to  its 
mountainous topography, most activities on the mainland are concentrated on the narrow, 
low-lying  coast  line,  at  risk  to  sea-level  rise  (SLR)  and  coastal  erosion  while  the  landscape 
also  adds  risks  of  landslides  and  flash  flooding.  An  increase  in  severe  weather  events  will 
result  in  significant  expenditures,  which  will  further  constrain  St.  Vincent  and  the 
Grenadines' social and economic growth. 

St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  have  suffered  significant  impacts  over  the  past  five  years 
(2010 to 20141) as a result of severe weather events. In total, the loss to the country was in 
excess  of  US$600  million2  over  that  period,  equating  to  approximately  35%  of  its  Gross

Domestic Product (GDP). With per capita GDP amongst the lowest in the Caribbean3, severe 
weather  events  caused  by  anthropogenic  climate  change  will  fundamentally  restrict 
economic  development.  The  increased  coastal  erosion,  droughts,  storms,  floods  and 
landslides  of  the  last  decade  have  severely  impacted  livelihoods  and  government  have 
neither the financial or technical resources to address these challenges. 

Climate  projections  for  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  suggest  an  increase  in  average 
atmospheric  temperature;  reduced  average  annual  rainfall; 
increased  Sea  Surface 
Temperatures  (SST);  and  the  potential  for  an  increase  in  the  intensity  of  tropical  storms4.  
There  is  currently  no  monitoring  of  sea  level  around  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines; 
however observations from tidal gauges surrounding the Caribbean basin indicate that SLR 
in the Caribbean is broadly consistent with the global trend.  

The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  in  their  5th  Assessment  Report, 
states  the  following  projected  changes  over  2081-2100  (relative  to  1986-2005)  for  the 
Caribbean for an intermediate low-emissions scenario: 

*  a decrease in average annual rainfall of about 5-6%; 

*  a 1.2°C to 2.3°C median annual increase in surface temperature; and 

*  sea level rise projections in the region of 0.5 m to 0.6 m5. 

With  climate-related  events  already  causing  damage  and  loss,  these  projections  have  dire 
implications  for  agriculture,  water  availability,  and  the  protection  of  public  and  tourism 
infrastructure if no meaningful action is taken. 

Despite the obvious focus on adaptation to climate change and the fact that greenhouse gas 
(GHG)  emissions  from  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  only  account  for  approximately 
0.001%  of  global  emissions6,  the  GoSVG  is  striving  to  reduce  its  emissions.  As  well  as 
developing a national Energy Action Plan, there is a comprehensive Mitigation Assessment 
in  the  forthcoming  Second  National  Communication.  The  largest  contributor  to  reducing 
emissions will be the installation of a geothermal electricity generation facility, which when 
operational  will  provide  over  50%  of  the  country's  electricity  needs.  Further  to  this, 
initiatives are underway to improve energy efficiency in buildings and transport as well as 
reduce emissions from waste going to landfill. 

St  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  would  like  to  express  its  support  for  the  Republic  of  China 
(Taiwan)  which  has  completed  its  own  INDC  despite  not  being  a  Party  to  the  UNFCCC. 
Taiwan has committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 50 percent compared to its business-
as-usual  scenario  by  2030  (20%  lower  than  2005).  We,  therefore,  urge  the  UNFCCC  to 
consider the observership of Taiwan in this mechanism.

2.  Mitigation 

Economy-wide Contribution 

St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  intends  to  achieve  an  unconditional,  economy-wide 
reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 22% compared to its business as usual 
(BAU) scenario by 2025.

22% 

 

While  the  proposed  contribution  is  economy-wide  and  is  in  comparison  to  all  sectors  and 
sources of emissions7, the contribution is based upon key measures in the energy (including 
energy  generation,  energy  efficiency  and  transport)  sector.  The  following  sections  explain 
the strategies and measures which will be undertaken to deliver the contribution. 

The energy sector accounted for approximately 68% of St. Vincent and the Grenadines' GHG 
emissions  in  20108  with  projected  further  growth  through  to  2025,  and  is  therefore  the 
focus  of  its  mitigation  activity.  Within  the  sector,  approximately  50%  of  emissions  can  be 
attributed to energy generation and approximately 50% from transport. The following sub-
sector mitigation contributions have been identified: 

i. 

Renewable  energy:  the  plans  for  renewable  energy  generation  are  focused  on  the 
development  of  the  country's  proposed  geothermal  power  plant  (planned  to  be 
completed in 2018). The facility, when complete, will generate approximately 50% of 
the  national  annual  electricity  consumption  needs.  In  addition  to  the  geothermal

plant,  the  national  energy  utility  is  renovating  existing  hydro  power  facilities  to 
improve efficiency and generation capacity as well as enabling and encouraging the 
installation of small-scale photovoltaics (PV) in the private and public sectors.  

Energy  efficiency:  there  is  an  objective  to  achieve  a  15%  reduction  in  national 
electricity consumption9 compared to a BAU scenario by 2025. Planned measures in 
this sector include  the retrofitting of street lighting nationally, a new building code 
and an energy labelling scheme for appliances.  

Transport: new policies to reduce the import duty paid on low emission vehicles are 
in  the  process  of  being  introduced  to  encourage  their  use. It  is  estimated  that  this 
will result in avoided emissions of approximately 10% over the next 10 years10.  

Significant  potential  for  greater  reductions  (e.g.  improved  public  transport)  is 
achievable if international finance can be made available, however this needs further 
analysis to quantify the reduction potential and support required  and consequently 
these  measures  have  not  been  included  in  the  economy-wide  contribution  at  this 
stage. Currently, transport is the fastest growing source of emissions and reductions 
from  this  sector  will  be  largely  dependent  on  international  financial  support  and 
technology transfer. 

Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF): St. Vincent and the Grenadines 
intends  to  develop  its  GHG  sinks  though  reforestation,  afforestation  reduced 
deforestation and reduced forest degradation. At this stage, good quality  data does 
not  exist  for  the  forestry  inventory,  however  this  is  in  the  process  of  being 
addressed.  Once  the  forestry  inventory  is  compiled,  policies  and  actions  will  be 
developed for the sector, however the related contribution is not quantifiable at this 
stage. Policies and actions may be delivered through mechanisms such as the ‘Clean 
Development  Mechanism'  (CDM)  and  ‘Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and 
Forest Degradation' (REDD).

Estimated quantified impact on GHG 
emissions   

Reduction in GHG emissions of 22% compared to its 
business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2025. 

Business as usual methodology 

The following assumptions have been made to 
generate the BAU scenario: 
*  Electricity supply - extrapolation of projected 

energy demand 2015-201812 

*  Non-electrical energy supply - assumed to grow 

consistent with population growth 

*  Domestic transport - extrapolation of historical 

road vehicle numbers 

*  Municipal Solid Waste generation per capita - 

assumed to grow consistent with population 
growth 

*  All other sources (which are estimated together 

to contribute less than 10% of GHG emissions) 
have been assumed to increase in line with 
population growth other than the LULUCF 
sector, where no change is assumed from 2010.

Parameter  

Information  

St. Vincent and the Grenadines considers the use of 
instruments for achieving and financing flexibly part 
of its mitigation target. Therefore St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines supports the inclusion of the 
International Carbon Markets and mechanisms such 
as the CDM in a post-2020 agreement on climate 
change including the use of the mitigation outcome 
pre-2020. We propose that such an instrument, 
together with an appropriate accounting system 
(MRV), is used to help finance low carbon and 
climate resilient infrastructure investments. St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines considers that certain 
low emission development options mentioned in 
this INDC, or additional actions, could be entirely or 
partially funded by the transfer of international 
carbon assets mobilized through bilateral, regional 
and international carbon markets while taking into 
account environmental integrity and transparency.

Metrics and methodology  

4.  Vulnerability and Adaptation 
4.1 National programmes that support climate change adaptation 

The economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines is strongly linked to its natural resources.  
The country has a long history of coping with natural disasters and, through traditional land 
cultivation  methods  and  cultural  association  with  the  sea,  Vincentians  also  have  a  long 
history of natural resource conservation.   

The St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013 - 
2025 has been elaborated around a specific set of strategic goals, objectives and targets so 
as to facilitate and guide the optimal improvement of the quality of life for all Vincentians. 
The Plan, which encapsulates the issues of Rio and the post 2015 UN Development Agenda, 
has been adopted by all Ministries and is used to guide programmes and activities. 

In  particular,  Goal  4  of  the  Plan;  ‘Improving  Physical  Infrastructure,  Preserving  the 
Environment and Building Resilience to Climate Change' seeks to ensure that St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines develops its physical infrastructure, while preserving the country's delicate 
environment,  as  well  as  mitigating  the  effects  of  climate  change.  To  reduce  the  adverse 
impacts of climate change, the Plan proposes several adaptation measures to reduce future 

 
restoration costs and to protect the natural environment. Public education and awareness 
of  the  potential  negative  effects  of  climate  change  are  at the  forefront  of  this  Plan16.  The 
proposed strategic interventions include: 

Increase public awareness with regard to climate change issues; 

* 
*  Build resilience to minimise damage to settlement and infrastructure; 
*  Minimise damage to beach and shoreline integrity and marine ecosystems; 
*  Minimise  the  negative  impact  of  climate  change  on  agriculture  and  human  health; 

and 

*  Develop appropriate legislative and regulatory framework, for proper environmental 
management,  and  institutional  systems  for  responding  and  mitigating  effects  of 
climate change17. 
 

4.2 Existing vulnerabilities in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors 

Agriculture  is  one  of  the  largest  economic  activities  on  St.  Vincent  and  it  contributes 
significantly  to  the  economic  and  social  development  of  rural  livelihoods  in  particular. 
Offshore  fisheries  are  also  important  and  are  predominately  small  scale  and  artisanal. 
Tourism  activities  are  concentrated  in  the  Grenadines  islands  and  all  other  livelihood 
activities in these islands are inherently linked to tourism. Such livelihoods are vulnerable to 
climate  change  impacts,  as  they  are  heavily  dependent  on  the  stability  of  the  climate 
conditions or natural resources. 

The agriculture sector in St. Vincent is  especially sensitive to extended periods of drought, 
unevenly distributed rainfall and natural disasters when coupled with existing practices such 
as  mono-cropping  and  poor  soil  and  water  management.  Three  extreme  climatic  events 
over a span of three years (2009 - 2011 inclusive) highlighted the vulnerability in this sector.  

* 

In  2009  there  was  a  water  shortage  resulting  from  drought  conditions.  Many 
residents  in  Georgetown  practise  agriculture  and  farmers  suffered  losses  from 
reduced crop production that year. As a consequence, food prices rose and produce 
had  to  be  imported  from  other  islands  to  supplement  the  limited  supply  in  St. 
Vincent. 

* 

In 2010 hurricane Tomas resulted in losses totalling EC $35 million, mainly to banana 
and plantain production.  

*  During  the  second  week  of  April  2011  heavy  rainfall  caused  rivers  to  overflow  and 
landslides in the north-eastern section of St. Vincent in a major agricultural area. This 
occurred  while  the  sector  was  still  recovering  from  damages  caused  by  hurricane 
Tomas in the previous year. 

4.3 Existing vulnerabilities in the tourism sector 

Expected increases in the frequency or magnitude of certain weather and climate extremes 
(e.g. heat waves, droughts, floods, tropical cyclones) as a result of climate change will affect 

                                                             
16 St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025 
17 St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025 
 

the  tourism  industry  through  increased  infrastructure  damage,  additional  emergency 
preparedness  requirements,  higher  operating  expenses  (e.g.  insurance,  backup  water  and 
power systems and evacuations) and business interruptions. 

Results  from  the  SLR  modelling  work  conducted  in  2011  indicate  that  1  metre  SLR  places 
10% of the major tourism properties at risk, along with 1% of road networks, 50% of airports 
and 67% of sea ports.  Engineered structures and natural environments (e.g. mangroves) can 
protect against some of these impacts to coastal regions, but the dynamics of these erosion 
processes will demand some adaptation of coastal infrastructure and settlements18. 

4.4 Existing vulnerabilities in the coastal zone 

More than 90% of the infrastructural development of St. Vincent and the Grenadines lies on 
a narrow coastal belt less than eight meters above sea-level. These include the island's main 
communication  and  emergency  response  structures  -  roads,  airports,  telecommunication, 
financial,  and  technical  support  centres19.    Additionally,  many  of  the  coastal  protection 
ecosystems such as dunes, mangroves and reefs have been removed or are degraded, which 
exacerbate  vulnerability  of  coastal 
infrastructure  to  storm  and  hurricane  activity 
(particularly wind and storm surges). 

4.5 Existing vulnerabilities in the water resources sector 

Watersheds have also been affected by land degradation due to "squatting, mono-cropping 
with poor agricultural techniques, global weather patterns (changes in rainfall distribution, 
drought  and  elevated  atmospheric  temperatures),  deforestation  and  excessive  use  of 
agrochemicals"20. 

Climate models suggest that the country will experience drying throughout the year (even 
during the wet season). Further reduced rainfall would severely impact the water supply of 
rivers and streams in St. Vincent and is of particular concern for the Grenadine islands which 
have  a  very  high  dependence  on  rainwater  for  freshwater  supply.    An  increase  in  the 
intensity  of  rainfall  in  fewer  rain  days  is  also  expected,  which  means  that  not  only  is  the 
country vulnerable to droughts, but also to the secondary effects of torrential rains such as 
landslides and the contamination of water supplies.  

4.6 Existing vulnerabilities in the health sector 

Vector borne diseases may increase due to increased precipitation and temperatures in St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines. In the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Strategic Plan For Health 
2007  -  2012  it  was  stated  that  "National  household  and  Breteaux  indices  continue  to  be 
above and beyond internationally accepted levels". Dengue is specifically mentioned21 but 
malaria cases have also been reported. Data obtained from the Ministry of Health reported 
1  imported  case  of  malaria  in  2008  and  another  in  2010.  The  Caribbean  Environmental

Health Institute (2007) has also stated that "There are serious issues related to availability of 
water, health and sanitation in the context of vector control"22.  

4.7 Efforts to adapt to climate change 

A number of steps to address climate change related issues have been taken over the years 
but  now  that  such  efforts  are  being  integrated,  it  is  timely  that  St.  Vincent  and  the 
Grenadines is revisiting its draft National Climate Change Policy to further give weight and 
direction to its efforts in response to climate change. 

St. Vincent and the Grenadines has recognised the need to take an integrated approach to 
adaptation  by  linking  local  activities  with  national  policies  and  sector  specific  experiences. 
Climate  change  adaptation  activities  have  been  mainstreamed  into  national  development 
planning (through the National Economic and Social Development Plan) and continues to be 
a major focus and several actions have been identified to support resilience building at all 
levels. The areas which have been incorporated within the plan include: culture, identity and 
national  pride;  economic;  social  capital;  governance;  national  security;  energy,  disaster 
management 
education, 
telecommunications,  science  and  technology23.  The  National  Economic  and  Social 
Development Plan possess nine over-arching goals including: 

infrastructure 

and 

environment; 

physical 

and 

the 

Improved physical infrastructure and environmental sustainability; 

*  High and sustained levels of economic growth; 
*  Reduced unemployment and poverty levels; 
* 
*  High levels of human and social development; 
*  Safe and secure nation; 
*  Technologically advanced work-force; 
* 
*  Regional integrity; and 
*  Enhanced global solidarity. 

Increase national pride and cultural renaissance; 

Future priorities will include the development of a public education framework, targeted at 
providing a curriculum for climate resilient agriculture, based on traditional techniques and 
expertise. 

4.8 National climate change adaptation programmes 

The main activities being implemented at the national level include the following: 

1.  The Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience  (PPCR) is the largest project in St. Vincent 
and  Grenadines  specifically  designed  to  address  climate  risk  and  resilience.  The  PPCR 
proposes to enhance climate risk management through the following broad strategies:  

a.  Strengthen community resilience to cope with climate hazards;  
b.  Increase institutional capacity to undertake climate risk management;  
c.  Strengthen knowledge and awareness;  

                                                             
22 The CARIBSAVE Climate Change Risk Atlas (CCCRA)-St. Vincent and the Grenadines 
23 St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025 
 

d.  Prepare comprehensive hazard maps for public institutions and communities;  
e.  Design and implement gender sensitive disaster risk management initiatives; and  
f.  Collaborate  with  communities  at  all 
levels  of  climate  and  disaster  risk 

management.  

The PPCR has four main components24: 

Component 1: Climate vulnerability risk assessment and risk reduction. This component is 
being piloted in Union Island, Arnos Vale Watershed and the Georgetown Watershed and 
a range of data relative to other components has been collected. 

Component  2:  Data  collection,  analysis  and  information  management.  There  are  three 
key  aspects  to  this  Component:  the  acquisition  and  installation  of  telemetric  weather 
stations  and  software;  coastal  zone  impacts  modelling  and  the  development  of  a 
harmonized platform for data analysis and data management. 

Component 3:  Comprehensive framework for strengthening of the existing policy, legal 
and  institutional  framework  to  address  Climate  Change.    This  component  seeks  to 
strengthen the existing policy, legal and institutional framework. It will commence with 
comprehensive  review  of  current  policies,  plans  and  legislative  framework  to  improve 
SPRC  implementation  in  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines.  It  will  also  involve  finalising 
various  policies,  drafting  a  disaster  management  plan  and  preparing  and  finalising  an 
Environmental Management Act and Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations. 

Component  4:  Design  and  implementation  of  a  public  education  and  capacity  building 
programme.  This component will provide for a  range of  initiatives in support of public 
and  private  sector  capacity  building.  These  include  a  national  3-year  public  education 
programme  to  build  community  based  climate  risk  and  resilience,  provide  a  national 
curriculum for schools in climate change and disaster risk reduction, plan and develop an 
early warning system for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, provide technical training and 
extend the school risk assessment to cover all constituencies in the country. 

4.9 Adaptation planning in the agriculture sector 

Agriculture which for decades underpinned the economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines 
has  declined  significantly  over  the  last  decade  due  to  restrictive  trade  regimes.  This  has 
resulted  in  significant  land  use  change  as  demand  for  housing  is  often  met  by  developing 
agricultural  lands.    However,  the  Government  of  St.  Vincent  has  demonstrated  its 
commitment to agricultural diversification and through its policies and programmes.  These 
efforts include the following: 

*  Support  for  small  scale  farmers  from  the  government,  in  production  technologies, 
agri-business management, good agricultural practices and pest and disease control; 
policy  initiatives  to  address  climate  change  issues,  environmental  protection,  risk 
mitigation  and  fisheries  development;  and  a  national  plan  for  dealing  with  food 
security.

*  An innovative project which abandoned land into a model for sustainable living and 
farming systems in St. Vincent, young persons in local primary and secondary schools 
are taught organic agriculture, environmental art and creative land use. 

*  The implementation of the National Forest Resources Conservation Plan (1994-2003) 
and Integrated Forest Management and Development Programme to address issues 
of  rapid  deforestation,  limited  involvement  of  communities  in  forest  resource 
management,  weak  institutional  capacity,  lack  of  an  approved  forestry  policy 
framework,  fragmented  environmental  management  and  limited  awareness  of  the 
importance of forests to national development. 

*  Enhancing the adaptive capacity of rural economies and natural resources to climate 
change  through  the  management  and  protection  of  land  based  natural  resources 
and agricultural production systems.

Adaptation planning in the coastal zone 

Coastal  areas  already  face  pressure  from  natural  forces  (wind,  waves,  tides  and  currents) 
and  human  activities,  (beach  sand  removal  and  inappropriate  construction  of  shoreline 
structures).  The impacts of climate change, in particular SLR, will magnify these pressures 
and accelerate coastal erosion. Areas at greatest risk in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are 
Belmont  Walkway,  Canash  Beach,  Indian  Bay,  Johnson  Point  and  Villa  Beach  including 
notable  resorts,  ports  and  an  airport  that  lies  at  less  than  6  m  above  sea  level  and  will 
therefore be affected"25. 

The  country  has  started  to  promote  itself  as  a  dive  destination  and  has  signed  on  to  the 
Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI) with the pledge to protect 20% of its near shore marine 
and coastal resources by 2020. Other initiatives include: 

*  Participating  in  the  ‘Improving  the  Management  of  Coastal  Resources  and  the 
Conservation  of  the  Marine  Biodiversity  in  the  Caribbean  Region'  project  which  is 
seeking  to  address  marine  resources  management  and  strengthen  capacity  of 
stakeholders through a common institutional framework for management of marine 
protected areas (MPA) in the Caribbean Region.  

*  Formulating coastal zone related policies through the activities of the PPCR. 
*  Reducing climate change induced risks for the population through coastal protection 

through various specific initiatives including: 

o  the Sans Souci Coastal Defence Project;  
o  At the Water's Edge (AWE): Coastal Resilience in Grenada and St. Vincent and 

the Grenadines (2011-2016) project; and  

o  Coastal Protection for Climate Change Adaptation in the Small Island States in 

the Caribbean 2014-2018 project. 

The Fisheries Division  is proposing a Coastline Protection Project which would provide the 
synergy  with  the  Sans  Souci  Coastal  Defence  Project  in  terms  of  halting  beach  and  cliff

erosion,  stabilize  the  shoreline  and  restore  the  beach  and  near-shore  reef.  Additional 
benefits are to attract and provide habitat for fish, lobster and other marine life.

Adaptation planning in the water resources sector 

St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  has  not  devised  a  National  Water  Policy  or  Water 
Management  Plan  but  there  is  a  Draft  Road  Map  toward  Integrated  Water  Resources 
Management  (IWRM)  Planning  for  Union  Island,  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines. 
Importantly,  there  are  efforts  that  contribute  to  adaptation  at  the  community  and 
household level. These initiatives are: 

*  The construction of Reverse Osmosis plant in Bequia. 
*  Rooftop rainwater harvesting systems have been installed through several projects: 

o  at 6 sites in St. Vincent and the Grenadines  (Sandy Bay Government School, 
Georgetown  Community  Centre,  Park  Hill  Primary  School,  Langley  Park 
Government  School,  Richland  Park  Government  School  and  Liberty  Lodge 
Boys  Training  Centre).    The  beneficiary  schools  are  also  used  as  hurricane 
shelters. 

o  For households in selected communities in St. Vincent to secure and provide 
potable  drinking  water  when  there  is  water  scarcity  or  shortage  of  water 
available. 

 

4.12 

Adaptation planning in the health sector 

The policy of the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  is to  provide universal 
health  care  that  reflects  the  principles  of  equity,  affordability,  quality,  and  cultural 
acceptance  for  its  citizens.    Whilst  there  is  no  explicit  action  towards  adapting  the  health 
sector  to  climate  change,  The  Millennium  Development  Goals,  the  Essential  Public  Health 
Functions, and the Caribbean Cooperation in Health, Phase III, and other initiatives provide a 
good basis for adaptation.

Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation 

St.  Vincent  is  a  member  of  the  Caribbean  Disaster  Emergency  Management  Agency 
(CDEMA)  an  inter-regional  supportive  network  of  independent  emergency  units  that 
responds  to  disasters  wherever  they  occur  in  the  region.  The  National  Emergency 
Management Organisation (NEMO) falls under the ambit of the Prime Minister's Office. 

In  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines,  there  is  recognition  of  the  importance  of  disaster 
management  to  environmental  management.  In the  National  Environmental  Management 
Strategy and Action Plan, Principle 9 is to "Prevent and Manage the Causes and Impacts of 
Disaster"26.  Two  strategies,  with  specific  activities,  are  therefore  designed  to  help  NEMO 
achieve this part of the environmental management plan.  Strategy 29 is to "Establish at the 
community and national levels, appropriate and relevant integrated frameworks to prevent,

prepare  for,  respond  to,  recover  from  and  mitigate  the  causes  and  impacts  of  natural 
phenomena on the environment and to prevent manmade disasters"27. 

*  Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction (RDVRP) Project 2011-2018 estimated to cost 
US$20.92  million  is  addressing  policy,  data  management,  infrastructure  and  capacity 
issues  in  the  areas  of  Climate  Change  Adaptation  and  Disaster  Risk  Management.    It 
seeks to measurably decrease the vulnerability of people and the national economy of 
St. Vincent and the Grenadines to climate change and natural hazards.  

*  The  Pilot  Project  on  Climate  Resilience  (PPCR)  is  addressing  mainly  infrastructural 

support in response to climate change and sea-level rise. 

5.  Fairness and Ambition 

Despite its negligible contribution to global GHG emissions (approximately 0.001%) and the 
fact that it is still a developing economy, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is taking significant 
and  ambitious  steps  to  reduce  its  national  emissions.  The  proposed,  unconditional 
contribution  would  result  in  a  reduction  in  projected  per  capita  emissions28  to  4.3  tonnes 
CO2e in 2025, which is less than the global average of 5.3 tonnes CO2e emissions per capita 
in 2025, the level  required to be consistent with returning warming to  below  1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels29. This demonstrates that  St. Vincent and the Grenadines' ambition to 
reduce emissions is significant and reflects a fair contribution in the global context for 2025, 
while allowing the country's economy to continue to develop. 

6.  Planning Process 

The  development  of  the  INDC  has  involved  detailed  stakeholder  consultation  with  public 
and  private  sector  experts  to  determine  the  level  and  type  of  contribution,  how  the 
contribution  will  be  achieved  and  identify  the  procedures  that  will  see  climate  change 
integrated  into  central  institutional  processes.  This  will  be  summarised  by  St.  Vincent  and 
the  Grenadines  forthcoming  Climate  Change  Policy.  The  Ministry  of  Health,  Wellness  and 
Environment  will  be  responsible  for  facilitating  multilateral  dialogue  on  climate  change 
issues as well as overseeing implementation of the INDC. 

Elements  of  the  INDC  are  already  enshrined  in  the  national  agenda  through  the  existing 
‘National  Social  and  Economic  Development  Plan  2013-2025'  (Strategic  Goal  4),  which 
addresses  the  strategic  necessity  to  adapt  to  the  changing  climate  to  protect  its  delicate 
environment while reducing GHG emissions. The ‘National Physical Development Plan' also 
references  the  importance  of  energy  efficiency  in  buildings  and  transport.  The  national 
electricity  utility  provider,  VINLEC,  has  also  established  a  feed-in-tariff  to  encourage  the 
installation of distributed PV.

8.1 billion 
(http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=Health%20Nutrition%20and%20Population%20Sta
tistics:%20Population%20estimates%20and%20projections) and global emissions of 43 GtCO2e 
(http://climateanalytics.org/files/ca_briefing_benchmark_emissions_1p5_and_2oc_2020_2025_2030_201502
10_final_bh_may.pdf)". 

 
Whilst the report has been prepared as partial fulfillment of the country's obligations to the 
UNFCCC,  there  are  many  domestic  benefits  of  developing  and  implementing  an  INDC.   St. 
Vincent and the  Grenadines' INDC clearly  demonstrates its political commitment and help 
realize  non-climate  benefits  that  support  developmental  priorities,  in  particular,  reduced 
spending  on  imported  fossil  fuels.   Additionally,  these  actions  are  consistent  with  the 
strategies and programmes identified in the Climate Change and the Caribbean: A Regional 
Framework  for  Achieving  Development  Resilient  to  Climate  Change  endorsed  by  the 
CARICOM Heads of State. 

7.  Means of Implementation 

St. Vincent and the Grenadines has shown its commitment to mitigating climate change by 
independently  taking  concrete  measures  to  reduce  its  emissions,  particularly  through 
renewable  energy  and  waste  initiatives30.  It  is  hoped  that  this  commitment  and  ambition 
will  be  recognised  by  the  international  community  as  progressive  (in  the  context  of  the 
country's SIDS status) and that it will enable  the country to  leverage international finance 
(through  the  Green  Climate  Fund  for  example),  technology  transfer  and  capacity-building 
support  to  help  further  reduce  emissions,  especially  in  the  areas  of  transport,  renewable 
energy and energy efficiency.  

In particular, St. Vincent and the Grenadines would welcome financial and capacity-building 
support  to  help  produce  a  Nationally  Appropriate  Mitigation  Action  (NAMA)  for  the 
country's  transport  sector.  This  is  a  key  priority  if  national  GHG  emissions  are  to  be 
stabilised  and  reduced  over  the  coming  years.  Similar  international  support  in  capacity-
building  and  finance  for  the  LULUCF  sector  is  also  sought  to  help  establish  a  related 
programme of mitigation actions. 

Despite  the  injection  of  funds  to  the  country  through  the  PPCR,  the  need  for  financing 
climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation  in  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  remains 
significant.  This is especially so considering the extent of vulnerabilities and the percentage 
of  the  population  potentially  exposed.  Devastating  losses  already  being  experienced  and 
projected  climate  change  impacts  suggest  that  mobilizing  additional,  adequate  and  timely 
financing is vital to the country's socio-economic development.
