CONTRIBUTION IN TERMS OF ADAPTATION
CONTRIBUTION IN TERMS OF ADAPTATION 

1.  Rationale  and  process  for  developing 

Rationale  and  process  for  developing  STP  adaptation  measures  are  aimed

ed  at  improving  the 

 

INDCs on adaptation 

country's ability to adapt to the adverse consequences of 

 

 

 

CC, thus contributing to the country's development. 

The  rationale  for  the  inclusion  of  the  adaptation 

component in the INDC takes into consideration that the 

country  is  already  a  sink  of  greenhouse  gases.  In 

addition,  , the country shows vulnerability and fragility 

conditions  as a developing small island state, for which 

the  negative  impacts  of  CC  are  evident  in  all  sectors  of 

the  national  economy,  such  as:  Agriculture  and 

Livestock;  Forest  and  Soil;  Water,  Energy  and  Fishing; 

Coastal Zone and Population; Health and Education.   

Being  a  LDC,  STP  requires  external  support 

to 

implement a CC resilient development. In this regard the 

INDC process is also considered as a mechanism to raise 

awareness  of  the  national  adaptation  program  at  the 

international  level  in  order  to  attract  technical,  financial 

and capacity-building support for its implementation. 

2.  Summary  of  Climate  Change  trends, 

STP  is  already  suffering  the  impacts  of  CC.  Several 

impacts and vulnerabilities. 

tyrends  have  been  observed:  increasing  temperature, 

decreasing 

rainfall, 

longer  dry  season  "gravana", 

decreasing  river  flow  level,  which  causes  the  risk  of 

decreasing  groundwater  reservoirs  ,  floods,  raising  sea 

level and increasing coastal erosion.  

These trends have negative economic impacts on energy 

production, fishing  activities,  forestry  and  agro forestry, 

agriculture and livestock. 

All these trends and impacts have already been identified 

and 

documented 

(in 

the 

Second  National 

Communication) and they represent a major concern for 

the country. 

 

3.  Reporting on long-term and near-term 

Depending  on 

the  future  availability  of  financial, 

adaptation visions, goals and targets 

technological and capacity-building support provided by 

 

 

 

the  international  community,  the  country  plans  in  short 

and medium terms to implement the following actions: 

I. Strengthening the National Service of Civil Protection 

and  Fire,  by  2025,  to  respond  to  fire  and  other 

environmental  disasters,  increasing  resilience  to  climate 

change, 

thus  contributing 

to 

social  well-being; 

 

II.  Reduce  the  number  of  people  living  in  vulnerable 

areas at risk, by providing housing in safer areas; 

III.  Develop  a  national  program 

for  sustainable 

management  of  the  forest  and  agro  forestry  ecosystems 

by 2025; 

IV. Introduce radar reflectors on board all fishing vessels 

by 2025, reducing the number of accidents at sea; 

V. Train and equip fishermen with means to enable safe 

fishing and train them in the proper use of fishing gear. 

In  the  medium  and  long  terms,  Sao  Tome  and  Principe 

will  be  conditionally  committed  to    implement  the 

following  activities  ,  depending  on  the  availability  of  

financial,  technological  and  capacity-building  support, 

from the international community: 

I. 

Reduce  the  illegal  and  indiscriminate  felling  of 

trees by 15%, by 2030; 

II.  Develop  scientific  and  technical  research  on 

adaptation of new productive crop varieties with 

a broad spectrum of tolerance to adverse climate 

impacts by 2030; 

III. 

IV. 

Promote forestry / planting of species resistant to 

dry and low rainfall by 2030; 

Improve  pasture  with  grazing  selection  by 

applying rotation management of the of plots by 

 

2030; 

V. 

Increase  the  resilience  to  erosion  and  maritime, 

river and storm flooding of coastal areas through 

improved  Coastal  Protection  for  vulnerable 

communities;  

VI. 

Reduce 

the  use  of  nitrogen  fertilizers 

in 

agriculture by 2030. 

4.  Reporting  on  current  and  planned 

To achieve the objectives of the above mentioned actions 

adaptation undertakings and support 
 

 

 

in  paragraph  3,  17  specific  projects  were  identified  and 

listed  in  the  NAPA,  which  implementation  require 

external  financial  support  in  addition  to  technological 

support and capacity building. 

5.  Gaps and Barriers 

Financial Barriers: 

I. Difficult access to finance; 

II. Relatively long time for return on investment; 

III. Limited budgets from the State to create an enabling 

environment  for  resource  mobilization  to  encourage 

private sector investment. 

Technological  barriers  and 

lack  of  skilled  human 

resources 

I.  Non-  sufficient  and 

inappropriate 

technological 

abilities in the national market; 

II.  Absence  of  adequate  capacity-building  of  national 

experts on specific issues; 

II. Low access to modern and efficient technology. 

Institutional and Political barriers: 

I. Instability of the CC Committee; 

II. Deficient and incomplete disclosure of information on 

 

Climate Change; 

III. Absence of availability to a centralized CC database 

with needed information; 

IV.  Absence  of  policies  and  regulatory  activity  for  key 

sectors (energy, water, forests etc.). 

6.  Summary of Needs 

The  realization  of  the  priority  adaptation  projects 

 

identified  and  not  yet  properly  implemented,  require 

external  financial  support  in  order  to  ensure  their 

feasibility. 

As  well  as,  STP  requests  the  technologies  support  and 

capacity building.  

 

MITIGATION IN TERMS CONTRIBUITION  

2020-2030 

 

The  type  of  contribution  selected  by  STP  in  terms  of 

mitigation  is  based  on  results,  i.e.  the  reduction  of 

greenhouse gases to levels below the BAU. 

The BAU scenario by 2030 was based on the last GHG 

inventory of 2005. 

Taking 

into  consideration 

the  country's  national 

economic,  social  and  environmental  situation,  STP  will 

not present any unconditional contributions. 

The  contributions  of  STP  with  regard  to  mitigation  are 

conditioned  by  financial  support,  technological  support 

and capacity-building that the country will receive from 

abroad. 

In  2005,  emissions  were  about  93  ktCO2eq,  and  BAU 

projection  indicates  that  to  fulfil  the  condition  of  the 

supposed growth parameters by 2030, the emissions will 

reach 240 ktCO2eq. 

1.  Timeframe  
 

 
2.  Type of contribution  

3.  Target Level  

 

 

4.  GHG Reduction  

 

The  measures  which  STP  has  considered  as  potential 

contributions to this date,  are as follows: 

 

I. Isolated Mini Power plant (1 MW); 

II. Hydro Power plant connected to the main network (9 

MW); 

  III. Photovoltaic solar panels (12 MW); 
  III-  Mini-hydro  Power  plant  connected  to the  main  grid 

(4 MW). 

The  implementation  of  these  four  (4)  measures  would 

mean an introduction of about 47% renewable energy in 

the national electricity system compared to the projected 

BAU electricity production, of which 34% is hydro and 

13% solar (PV). 

  Thus,  STP  would  be  able  to  contribute  to  the  reduction 

of  Greenhouse  Gases  by  about  57  ktCO2eq,  which 

approximately  corresponds  to    a  24%  national  emission 

reduction by 2030 related to 2005.  

In  2030,  it  is  expected  that  national  emissions  will  be 

about 240 ktCO2eq, according to the BAU scenario. Net 

emissions  from  LULUCF  under  the  BAU  scenario  are 

expected  to  be  around  -630  ktCO2eq,  indicating  that  

STP will continue to be a carbon sink country, in which 

net absorptions will be - 400 ktCO2eq. 

5.  Means of Implementation  

To implement the above listed mitigation activities, it is 

 

estimated that a total investment of not less than US$ 59 

million  in  the  form  of  external  aid  will  be  required 

between 2020 and 2030. 

According  to  the  mitigation  measures  identified,  the 

necessary technologies are: 

I. Hydropower Electricity Generation Systems; 

II. Photovoltaic Electricity Generation Systems. 

Thus,  STP  requests    the  technologies  support  and 

capacity building  

6.  Sectors 

The  scope  of  the  contribution  covers  all  sectors  of  the 

 

7.  Gases 
8.  Accounting Methodology 

national economy. 

 CO2, CH4, NOx 

With  the  support  of  GACMO  model,  developed  by 

UNEP  DTU  Partnership, 

the  BAU  scenario  was 

constructed  based  on  the  national  GHG  Inventory 

(IGEE) of  2005 IGEE, according to the IPCC guidelines 

for NAI countries. 

The  mitigation  measures  were  selected  and  prioritized 

based  on  consultation  with  stakeholders,  which  formed 

the  basis  for  the  calculation  of  the  mitigation  scenario, 

calculated using the GACMO model. 

The  calculations  were  performed  without  including  the 

absorption of CO2 of forests. 

9.  Institutional Arrangements  

Apart  from  the  legal  framework  referred  to  in  the 

National Circumstances, for the analysis of mitigation, it 

took  into  account  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  ratified  on  May 

19,  2008,  by  Presidential  Decree  No.  9/2008  and  the 

Legal  Regime  of  the  Energy  Sector  created  by  Decree-

law No. 26/2014. 

10.  How is it equitable and adequate? 

STP is a GHG sinkhole country. However, it is willing to 

 

 

make  further  efforts  to  reduce  its  emissions  depending 

on  the  financial  support,  technological  resources  and 

support  for  capacity-building  it  may  receive  from  the 

international community. 

 

 

11.  Market mechanisms of participation 

According  to  the  Marrakesh  Call  for  Climate  Action, 

agreed  at  the  Ministerial  Dialogue  of  the  Seventh 

African Forum of Carbon, in April 2015, Sao Tome and 

Principe  recognizes  the  experience  gained  from  the 

implementation  of  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism 

and  want  to  be  supported  by  market  mechanisms  with 

high environmental integrity, contributing to sustainable 

development  and  establishing  strong 

incentives 

to 

harness the power of private sector. 

 

Sao  Tome  and  Principe  supports  the  use  of  market 

mechanisms including the results of mitigation pre-2020, 

such  as  the  use  of  Emission  Reduction  Certificates 

(ERCs) generated by CDM projects and programs. 

12.  Monitoring and Progress Report 

The  country  elaborated  a  Monitoring  and  Progress 

Report  System  proposal  (MPR)  to  (INDC)  according  to 

the  needs,  complying  with  international requirements  of 

the monitoring activities and progress of certain national 

contributions to adaptation and mitigation.
