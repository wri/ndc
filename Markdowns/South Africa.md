<meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8'>South Africa's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)  
 

Introduction 
In  accordance  with  decision  1/CP.19  and  1/CP.20  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the 
United  Nations  Framework  on  Climate  Change,  South  Africa  hereby  submits  its  intended 
nationally determined contribution (INDC) on adaptation, mitigation as well as finance and 
investment requirements for both. This INDC has been developed on the understanding that 
the Paris Agreement will be binding, fair, effective and incorporate a "no-backsliding" and a 
"progressive"  approach 
to  enhance  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation 
implementation and ambition. This implementation and ambition will be enabled by finance 
and technology and capacity building support. In this context, South Africa has transitioned 
its international mitigation commitment from a relative "deviation from Business-as-usual" 
to an absolute peak, plateau and decline greenhouse gas emissions trajectory range.  
 
South Africa is committed to addressing climate change based on science and equity. Climate 
change  is  already  a  measurable  reality,  and  is  primarily  as  a  result  of  the  rising 
concentration due to  human induced  cumulative  emissions of long-lived  greenhouse gases 
(GHG) in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution in the mid 1800's. South Africa has 
observed  and  is  projecting  further  trends  of  marked  temperature  increases,  rainfall 
variation and rising sea levels as well as an increased frequency of severe weather events. 
South  Africa's  response  is  informed  by  the  findings  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on 
Climate  Change  (IPCC)  that  warming  of  the  climate  system  is  unequivocal,  and  the 
understanding  that  further  mitigation  efforts  by  all  are  needed  to  avoid  high  to  very  high 
risk  of  severe,  widespread,  and  irreversible  impacts globally.  However,  irrespective  of  any 
adequate  mitigation  efforts,  the  IPCC  also  concludes  that,  due  to  the  inertia  and  long 
response  time  lags  in  the  global  climate  system,  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  are 
inevitable. Given that poor countries and communities  have the least responsibility for the 
challenge of global climate change but are the most vulnerable to its impacts, adaptation to 
the adverse effects of climate change is also a global responsibility and concern.  
 
The nature of the climate change challenge is one characterised by the overuse of a global 
commons  in  an  unequal  world.  Along  with  other  developing  countries,  South  Africa  is 
especially  vulnerable  to  its  impacts,  particularly  in  respect  of  water  and  food  security,  as 
well as impacts on health, human settlements, and infrastructure and ecosystem services. In 
this  regard,  South  Africa  is  committed  to  cooperative  efforts  to  adapt  to  the  unavoidable 
adverse  impacts  of  climate  change.  With  regard  to  an  ultimate  solution  to  the  global 
challenge  of  climate  change,  South  Africa  is  firmly  committed  to  working  with  others  to 
ensure  temperature  increases  are  kept  well  below  2°C  above  pre-industrial  levels,  which 
could include a further revision of the temperature goal to below 1.5°C in light of emerging 
science,  noting  that  global  average  temperature  increase of  2°C translates  to up  to  4°C for 
South Africa by the end of the century.  
 
This temperature  goal is an essential starting point for our INDC, and we  believe this goal 
should  inform  all  countries'  contributions  -  in  relation  to  both  adaptation  and  mitigation. 
More  and  earlier  mitigation  means  fewer  unavoidable  impacts,  lessening  the  requirement 
for adaptation investment. Near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived GHGs are needed 
in the second half of the century to avoid even greater impacts that are beyond adaptation 
capability. The solution must lie in collective action.  
 

Context: National Priorities and Circumstances 
South  Africa's  national  response  considers  both  development  needs  and  climate  change 
imperatives. South Africa faces the challenge of climate change as a developing country, with 
overriding priorities to eliminate poverty and eradicate inequality. Eliminating poverty and 
eradicating inequality requires addressing major challenges in creating decent employment, 
which  in  turn  requires  sustainable  economic  development,  improving  basic  education, 
health  and  social  welfare  and  many  other  basic  needs  such  as  access  to  food,  shelter  and 
modern energy services. In addition, South Africa is presently facing acute energy challenges 
that hamper economic development. As a result of the historical development pathway of its 
energy  sector,  South  Africa  is  currently  heavily  dependent  on  coal,  with  a  fleet  of  old  and 
inefficient coal-fired power plants that are nearing, but not yet at, the end of their design life-
cycles as well as being reliant on a significant proportion of its liquid fuels being generated 
from coal. 
 
Therefore,  in  the  short-term  (up  to  2025),  South  Africa  faces  significant  rigidity  in  its 
economy and any policy-driven transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society must 
take  into account and  emphasise  its  overriding  priority  to  address  poverty and inequality. 
South  Africa's  INDC  should  be  understood  in  the  context  of  these  and  other  national 
circumstances. 
 
South Africa's INDC was formulated in the context of, inter alia, the environmental right set 
out in section 24 of the Constitution, and its National Development Plan (NDP) (NPC, 2012), 
which  provides  a  ‘2030  vision'  to  guide  the  country's  sustainable  development  trajectory 
where poverty is eliminated and inequalities are reduced by 2030. The implementation of 
the 2030 NDP vision is further elaborated in its climate policy  (the 2011 National Climate 
Change  Response  Policy  (NCCRP)),  climate-compatible  sectoral  plans  and  its  National 
Sustainable Development Strategy. Good progress has been made in implementing climate-
compatible sectoral plans, such as the integrated energy and electricity plans (IEP and IRP), 
industrial policy action plans (IPAP) and the new growth path (NGP).  
 
The full implementation of these policies and plans will bend the curve of South Africa's GHG 
emissions  towards  a  peak,  plateau  and  decline  trajectory  range.  South  Africa  is  putting  in 
place a mitigation system to realise the opportunities of a low-carbon economy while being 
mindful that an inclusive and just transition requires time and well planned low-carbon and 
climate  resilient  development.  In  order  to  ramp  up  implementation  of  these  policies  and 
plans  over  time,  South  Africa  is  investing  heavily  in  transforming  its  energy  sector.  At  the 
heart  of  this  part  of  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  energy  sector  is  a  complete 
transformation of the future energy mix, which is designed to replace an inefficient fleet of 
ageing coal-fired power plants with clean and high efficiency technology going forward. To 
date,  we  have  facilitated  substantial  investment  in  renewable  energy  and  two  new  high-
efficiency  coal-fired  power  stations  are  nearing  completion  as  part  of  the  ageing  plant 
replacement  programme.  In  addition,  programmes  to  increase  efficiency  and  reduce 
emissions intensity across the economy are being rolled out.  
 
South  Africa  is  developing  a  National  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Strategy  and  Plan  to  be 
integrated  into  all  relevant  sector  plans,  and  upon  which  its  UNFCCC  National  Adaptation 
Plan (NAP) will be based. This plan is informed by an assessment of sectoral, cross-sectoral 
and  geographical  vulnerabilities  to  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change,  and  it  will 
quantify and present pathways for adaptation, towards an inclusive and just transition to a 
climate resilient economy and society, taking into account local and indigenous knowledge, 
gender  considerations,  as  well  as  social,  economic  and  environmental  implications.    South 
Africa considers its adaptation component of its INDC to be an important contribution to the 
global response to climate change. 

 
Assumptions 
South  Africa's  INDC  is  premised  on  the  adoption  of  a  comprehensive,  ambitious,  fair, 
effective  and  binding  multilateral  rules-based  agreement  under  the  UNFCCC  at  the  21st 
Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris. It is assumed that this agreement will attract the 
full participation of all Parties to the Convention and, consistent with scientific requirements 
in  the  short,  medium  and  long  term,  deliver  the  necessary  ambitious  mitigation  and 
adaptation  commitments,  enabled  and  supported  by  significant  climate  finance  and 
investment,  accessible  and  affordable  technology  and  substantial  capacity  building 
commitments.  South  Africa  expects  the  Agreement  will  include  effective  arrangements  for 
transparency of action and support.  It is further assumed that all of these commitments will 
give  effect  to  the  principles  of  equity  and  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and 
respective capabilities.  
 
It  is  assumed  that  this  agreement  will  provide  the  multilateral  rule-based  infrastructure, 
mechanisms  and  tools  to  enhance  international  and  regional  cooperation  on  mitigation. 
Further, that this cooperative effort enables and supports Parties' capability to transition to 
low  carbon  economies  and  societies  in  a  manner  that  addresses  the  social,  economic  and 
environmental dimensions of their sustainable development.  
 
The  adverse  effects  of  climate  change  have  been  a  stark  reality  for  South  Africa  for  many 
years. The evidence clearly emphasises the need for Parties to build resilience and adaptive 
capacity  to  understand  and  respond  to  climate  change  risk  and  vulnerability,  through 
developing and optimising climate change adaptation policy, planning, technology, practice 
and  implementation  coherence  of  developmental  programmes  and  actions.  It  is  assumed 
that the agreement will enhance international and regional cooperation on adaptation that 
enables  and  supports  Parties  capability  to  increasingly  integrate  adaptation  into  their 
climate  resilient  sustainable  development  planning  and  implementation  processes,  as  well 
as  to  support  their  climate  risk  management,  emergency  and  recovery  responses  to 
unavoidable climate and weather related adverse impacts.  

 

Adaptation component of the INDC (A-INDC) 
The adaptation component of South Africa's INDC will address adaptation through six goals, 
underpinned  by  key  elements  of  adaptation  planning,  costing  of  adaptation  investment 
requirements,  equity,  and means  of  implementation. The  table  below  outlines  information 
on the adaptation component of South Africa's INDC, based on the commitments of Parties 
provided for in Article 4 and the provisions of Article 12 of the Convention. This information 
enables Parties to  meet commitments under Article 4.4 and  the provisions of Article 12 of 
the Convention in relation to adaptation

Equity 
considerations 
in adaptation 

South Africa views adaptation as a global responsibility in the light of Article 2 of 
the Convention as further codified in the UNFCCC as a temperature goal. Further 
understanding  climate  impacts  as  being  driven  by  global  inaction  /  action  on 
mitigation, the adaptation burden is therefore a global responsibility. It is in that 
light that South Africa considers its investments in adaptation as a contribution 
to the global effort, which should be recognised as such. Further information is 
provided in the equity section of the INDC.  

 

Mitigation component of the INDC (M-INDC) 
In keeping with South Africa's commitment to progress its contribution to the global effort 
to  mitigate  climate  change  in  line  with  the  principle  of  common  but  differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities, South Africa's mitigation component of its INDC 
moves from a "deviation from business-as-usual" form of commitment and takes the form of 
a  peak,  plateau  and  decline  GHG  emissions  trajectory  range.  South  Africa's  emissions  by 
2025 and 2030 will be in a range between 398 and 614 Mt CO2-eq, as defined in national 
policy.  This  is  the  benchmark  against  which  the  efficacy  of  mitigation  actions  will  be 
measured. The table below outlines  elements in para 14 of 1/CP.20, further specifying the 
mitigation component of South Africa's INDC:

time-frames  within 

Peak,  plateau  and  decline  (PPD)  is  a  GHG  emissions  trajectory  range 
after  mitigation.  The  starting  point  for  PPD  considered  here  is  2020 
year-end. 
The 
that  are 
communicated  in  South  Africa's  INDC  are  2025  and  2030,  in  which 
emissions will be in a range between 398 and 614 Mt CO2-eq.  
 
The INDC reflects SA's full mitigation potential as assessed in 2014.  
 
The  policy  instruments  under  development  include  a  carbon  tax, 
desired  emission  reduction  outcomes  (DEROs)  for  sectors,  company-
level  carbon  budgets,  as  well  as  regulatory  standards  and  controls  for 
specifically identified GHG pollutants and emitters.  
 
South Africa will use five-year periods of implementation at the national 
level, specifically, 2016-2020 focused on developing and demonstrating 
the above mix of policies and measures in order to meet South Africa's

INDC.  This  level  of  effort  will  enable  South  Africa's  greenhouse  gas 
emissions to peak between 2020 and 2025, plateau for approximately a 
decade and decline in absolute terms thereafter. 
 
Periodic  domestic  reviews  will  ensure  a  dynamic  system,  in  which  the 
stringency  of  short-term  carbon  budgets  can  be  adjusted  in  successive 
implementation periods to ensure that South Africa remains within the 
overall carbon budget, which is the area under the PPD trajectory range.  
Depending  on  the  latest  available  science,  the  success  of  this  mix  of 
mitigation  policies  and  measures,  new  accessible  and  affordable 
technology, increased capability and emerging mitigation opportunities 
the  PPD  trajectory  range  may  also  be  adjusted,  without  compromising 
the  overall  ambition  of  South  Africa's  long-term  contribution  to  the 
global mitigation effort.  
Economy-wide, all sectors, six greenhouse gases (GHGs), with a material 
focus on three GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide  (N2O).  Sources  considered  are  the  ones  in  the  latest  GHG 
inventory (see below).  
IPCC  major  categories:  energy,  IPPU,  waste  and  AFOLU  (agriculture, 
forestry and other land use).  
Increased  disaggregation  over  time  will  be  enabled  through  the 
introduction  of  mandatory  GHG  reporting  domestically,  no  later  than 
2016, with regular reporting to the UNFCCC as multi-laterally agreed. 
Planning  processes:  The  approach  to  the  current  INDC  is  based  on 
national  climate  policy  (NCCRP)  and  the  national  development  plan 
(NDP),  and  will  be  given  effect  through  energy,  industrial  and  other 
plans and legislation.  
 
Assumptions: In accordance with the Convention, it is assumed that the 
extent  to  which  developing  country  Parties  will  effectively  implement 
their  commitments  will  depend  on  the  effective  implementation  by 
developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention 
relating to financial resources, development and transfer of technology, 
and  capacity  building.  The  INDC  is  put  forward  within  the  context  of 
equitable  access  to  sustainable  development  and  will  take  fully  into 
account  that  equity,  economic  and  social  development  and  poverty 
eradication are the first and overriding priorities. In this context, South 
Africa's INDC assumes the finalisation of an ambitious, fair, effective and 
binding  multilateral  agreement  under  the  UNFCCC  at  COP  21  in  Paris 
that further elaborates these commitments.  
 
PPD trajectory range:  South  Africa's  NCCRP  "details  the  ‘peak,  plateau 
and decline trajectory' used as the initial benchmark against which the 
efficacy  of  mitigation  actions  will  be  measured".  This  is  the  PPD 
trajectory  range  in  the  INDC.  Values  for  key  years  are  specified  in  the 
NCCRP.  
 
Mitigation  potential:  Initial  detailed  studies  of  mitigation  potential 
(2007) informed the aforegoing, with a base year 2003 for projections; 
these have been updated (2014; base year 2010), with the intention of 
on-going updating and improvement. 
 
Methodologies for Estimating Emissions: 2006 IPCC guidelines 
Metric applied: 100-year Global Warming Potential, as in the IPCC's 4th 
Assessment  Report  (AR4).  Note  that  the  current  GHG  inventory, 
consistent  with  the  2006  IPCC  guideline  reporting  requirements,  used 
GWPs  from  the  Third  Assessment  Report  (TAR)  and  indicated  that 
future inventories will use GWP values from AR4.

Approach to AFOLU:  Agriculture,  forestry  and  other  land  use  (AFOLU) 
are  included  as  one  of  the  major  IPCC  categories.  The  greater 
uncertainty  in  AFOLU  emissions  should  be  noted,  as  well  as  the 
intention to reduce uncertainty over time. 
A  relative  fair  share  of  aggregate  commitments  required  to  limit 
temperature  increase  to  well  below  2°C  above  pre-industrial  levels 
requires understanding of what others will do, and an equitable effort-
sharing  paradigm,  such  as  the  proposal  for  the  Paris  agreement  to 
elaborate an equity reference framework.  
 
In  the  absence  of  a  multi-laterally  agreed  equity  reference  framework, 
South African experts, applying Convention principles of responsibility, 
capability and access to equitable sustainable development, determined 
a carbon budget that is larger than the PPD trajectory range outlined in 
this INDC. South Africa has used this evidence base to evaluate whether 
its  INDC  is  a  relative  fair  effort.  In  the  context  of  this  objective 
assessment  of  South  Africa  is  of  the  view  that  its  contribution  is  both

The PPD trajectory range is an ambitious and fair effort in the context of 
national  circumstances,  and  priorities  to  eliminate  poverty  and 
inequality,  promote 
reduce 
unemployment.  It  presents  a  trajectory  that  is  consistent  with  a  just 
transition to a low carbon and climate-resilient future. 
 
South  Africa  is  committed  to  a  response  to  climate  change  based  on 
science and  equity,  which has informed this INDC and  will continue to 
inform our climate change response.  
 
We  consider  that  equity  applies  to  mitigation,  adaptation  and  support 
for  both.  Hence  further  details  on  equitable  access  to  sustainable 
development are outlined below.  
 
IPCC  AR5  has  provided  relevant  scientific  information  on  the  limited 
remaining  future  global  carbon  budget  consistent  with  achieving  the 
objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2. Within the context 
of  the  Convention  principles  of  equity  and  common  but  differentiated 
responsibility  South  Africa's  shift  from  a  "deviation  from  business-as-
usual"  commitment  to  a  peak,  plateau  and  decline  GHG  emissions 
trajectory range in its INDC fully aligns with the IPPC AR5 future global 
carbon  budget.  Carbon  budgets  are  an  important  form  of  flexibility  at 
the  national  level;  if  emissions  are  below  the  benchmark  trajectory 
range in a given year, they can exceed it in another year.

Support component of INDC (S-INDC) 
The key challenge for South Africa is to catalyse, at an economy-wide scale, financing of and 
investment in the transition to a  low carbon  and  climate resilient economy and society.  In 
this  context,  South  Africa's  S-INDC  comprises  indicative  scales  of  finance  and  investment 
required  for  both  adaptation  and  mitigation,  based  on  analyses  of  specific  sectors  and 
initiatives. The finance and investments are required to enable and support the deployment 
of low carbon and adaptation technology as well as building the capacity to govern, regulate, 
install and operate these technologies.  
 
South Africa has already investing about 6% of what would be the upper end of the costs of 
its adaptation per annum for the period 2021 to 2030. Since 2010 South Africa has invested 
in  adaptation,  with  an  increasing  national  capacity  building  expenditure  over  time  from 
US$0.28m  in  2010  to  US$1.2m  in  2015  per  year.  Over  the  same  period,  the  total  annual 
investment  in  implementation  increased  from  US$0.18  to  US$0.59  bn  per  year  in  the 
Agriculture and Forestry sectors; from US$ 0.23bn to US$0.36 bn in the Energy sector, from 
US$0.01 bn to $US 0.02 bn in Human Settlements sector; from US$ 0.03 bn to US$ 0.05 bn in 
Biodiversity sector; from US$ 0.17 bn to US$ 0.59 bn in the Water sector; and from US$0.02 
bn  to  US$  0.7  bn  in  the  disaster  risk  reduction  and  emergency  response  sector.  The  total 
investment  in  adaptation  therefore  increased  from  US$ 1.64  bn  in  2010  to  US$  2.31  bn  in 
2015.  
Some of the key programmes that will have to be scaled up further, include: 

1.  Working for Water (WfW) and Working on Fire estimated at US$1.2 bn per year. 
2.  Working on Wetlands estimated at US$0.12 bn per year. 
3.  Water Conservation and Demand Management estimated at US$5.3 bn per year.  
4.  Land restoration estimated at US$0.07 bn per year. 

South Africa seeks recognition of its national investments in adaptation as part of its relative 
fair  global  effort  and  analysis  of  future  scenarios  indicate  a  significant  increase  in 
requirements.  For  the  period  2021-2030  relative  to  1971-2000,  under  RCP8.5  (low 
mitigation), an increase of 4% in the median of costs is projected, with a 35% increase in the 
90th  percentile  of  costs  (that  is,  extreme  years  are  already  significantly  more  expensive). 
The  corresponding  figures  are  similar  for  RCP4.5  (medium-high  mitigation):  no  change  is 
projected  in  terms of  the median of  costs,  but  a 31%  increase  is projected  in  terms  of the 
90th percentile. For the period 2021-2050, the median of year-costs is projected to be 12% 
more  expensive  than  the  1971-2000  value  under  low  mitigation,  with  a  132%  increase  in 
the cost of extreme years (90th percentiles). For the case of  medium-high mitigation these 
values  are  projected  to  be  a  2%  decrease  in  the  cost  of  median-years,  but  with  a  similar 
increase of 119% in terms of the costs of extreme years. 
 
South Africa has already made significant investments in mitigation. As part of a Renewable 
Energy  Independent  Power  Producer  Procurement  Programme  (REI4P)  has  approved  79 
renewable  energy  IPP projects,  total 5  243MW,  with private  investment  totalling  ZAR  192 
billion (approx.  US$  16  billion). Another 6300 MW are under consideration. Investment  in 
public  transport  infrastructure  was  US$  0.5  billion  in  2012,  and  is  expected  to  continue 
growing  at  5%  per  year.  South  Africa  established  a  South  African  Green  Fund  with  an 
allocated  US$  0.11  billion  in  the  2011  to  2013  budgets  to  support  catalytic  and 
demonstration green economy initiatives. Resources for the Fund will have to be increased 
in future to enable and support the scaling up of viable and successful initiatives, including 
contributions from domestic, private sector and international sources.  
 
Analysis of the incremental costs of mitigation actions indicates that significant finance and 
investment  will  be  required  in  the  long-term.  The  following  estimates  are  of  total 
incremental costs required:  

1.  Estimated incremental cost to expand REI4P in next ten years: US$3 billion per year.  
2.  Decarbonised electricity by 2050 - estimated total of US$349 billion from 2010. 
3.  CCS: 23 Mt CO2 from the coal-to-liquid plant - US$0.45 billion. 
4.  Electric vehicles - US$513 billion from 2010 till 2050. 
5.  Hybrid electric vehicles: 20% by 2030 - US$488 billion  

These  costs  are  derived  from  energy  systems  and  economic  modelling.  Further  work  is 
needed to prepare  detailed  business plans for  finance  and  investment in mitigation. These 
numbers  are  presented  for  information  to  clarify  the  order  of  magnitude  of  mitigation 
finance and investment requirements.  
 
Some technologies that could help South Africa to further reduce emissions that have been 
identified  include:  Energy  efficient  lighting;  variable  speed  drives  and  efficient  motors; 
energy efficient appliances;  solar water heaters;  electric and hybrid electric  vehicles; solar 
PV; wind power; carbon capture and sequestration; and advanced bio-energy.  
 
South  Africa  is  implementing  a  mitigation  system  to  move  from  analysis  of  mitigation 
potential  to  full  implementation,  however,  human  and  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be 
further  enhanced.  The  information  on  investments  estimated  in  energy  and  economic 
models indicate relatively small impacts on GDP. Other socio-economic implications, notably 
any negative impacts on employment, need to be avoided and will be studied empirically as 
further mitigation measures are put in place. Current analysis of investments in renewable 
energy  projects  shows  that  these  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  economy.  Such  analysis 
should  further  provide  enhanced  information  through  financial  analysis  and  specific 
investment  proposals.  South  Africa  proposes  that  the  COP  should  consider  a  process  for 
improvement  of  information  on  finance  and  investments  required,  and  how  this  can  be 
integrated into existing reporting by developed and developing countries. The international 
frameworks should  also effectively operationalize support for  the enhancement  of  existing 
human, intellectual and institutional capacity, at the domestic and regional levels.  
 
Equitable access to sustainable development  
The core principles of equity, responsibility, capability and sustainable development are the 
basis  of  South  Africa's  INDC.  Equity  relates  to  adaptation,  mitigation  and  all  forms  of 
investment and support.  
 
Equity  does  not  only  relate  to  Parties'  respective  mitigation  actions,  as  those  least 
responsible  for  the  problem  of  global  climate  change,  namely  poor  countries  and 
communities,    are  most  vulnerable  to  its  impacts.  Those  countries  therefore  need  to  take 
urgent and costly adaptation actions. If insufficient mitigation is implemented globally, and 
average global temperatures exceed 2 °C, even more adaptation will be required, effectively 
shifting the burden of climate action onto developing countries. Those  who have  a greater 
responsibility  for  cumulative  emissions  that  have  driven  up  GHG  concentrations  in  the 
atmosphere  should,  as  a  matter  of  fairness,  assist  those  less  responsible.  Furthermore, 
investments  in  adaptation  represent  a  significant  opportunity  cost  with  respect  to 
investments  required  to  reduce  poverty  and  inequality,  create  employment,  improve 
education and address other development challenges.  
 
Regarding mitigation, as noted in the table above, analysis by South African experts reports 
that a fairly apportioned overall carbon budget for South Africa for the period from 2015 to 
2050  would  exceed  the  budget  implied  by  the  upper  limit  of  the  PPD  trajectory  range, 
although other approaches to equity report a much lower number.2  South Africa considers 
the  PPD  range  to  be  an  equitable  contribution  to  the  global  mitigation  effort,  given  South 
Africa's  current  and  historical  emissions  and  its  national  circumstances  (especially  its 
development  challenges).  The  PPD  emissions  trajectory  range  focuses  on  the  trend  in 
emissions  over  time.  Additionally,  defining  a  carbon  budget  or  space  over  time  provides 

                                                                 
2 The  carbon  budget  approach  of  Chinese  (CASS  /  DRC  joint  project  team  2011)  and  Indian 
researchers (Jayaraman , Kanitkar & dsouza 2011) allocates 7-11 Gt CO2 -eq to South Africa for 
the  period  2000-2049,    and  a  meta-analysis  of  different  approaches  shows  that  the  analysis  of 
different  effort-sharing approaches yields carbon budgets for South Africa that are  significantly 
smaller than the  PPD  trajectory  range.  Only the lower  PPD is  within the  range calculated using 
the PRIMAP tool in 2020. In 2025 and 2030, none of the PPD values overlap with the calculated 
ranges.  
flexibility  in  emissions  for  a  given  year.  The  national  carbon  budget  range  for  the  period 
2021-2025 is 1.99 -3.01 Gt CO2-eq and for 2026-2030 is in the range of 1.99 to 3.07 Gt CO2-
eq.   
 
An assessment of equity also needs to take into account means of implementation. Generally, 
South  Africa  needs  time  for  development,  which  is  necessary  to  eliminate  poverty,  reduce 
inequality, increase employment and promote inclusive economic  growth, while simultaneously 
seeking  to  contribute  to  mitigation  and  assist  our  vulnerable  communities  in  adapting  to 
climate impacts. Some specific finance and investment requirements for both adaptation and 
mitigation have been initially quantified above.  
Uncertainties 
Uncertainty  should  be  noted  in  two  respects.  Firstly,  the  greater  uncertainty  in  AFOLU 
emissions  (relative  to  other  sectors)  has  been  noted  above.  South  Africa's  current 
understanding is that our land sector is estimated to be a net sink. The intention is to reduce 
uncertainty in data over time, with a view to a comprehensive accounting approach for land-
based  emissions  and  removals.  Secondly,  trace  gases  are  less  material  and  data  is  more 
uncertain than for the three major gases.  For the current GHG inventory, submitted  to the 
UNFCCC as part of SA's first biennial update report (2014), data was gathered for CO2, CH4 
and  N2O.  Certain  HFCs  and  PFCs  were  reported  on  in  the  IPPU  (industrial  processes  and 
product use) sectors. Fluorinated gases are estimated to have contributed less than 0.3% to 
the total GHG budget over the period 2000 - 2010. A process is under way to estimate SF6 
emissions from power generation. Uncertainties such as the above are to be bounded over 
time. In the on-going process of implementing the mitigation system, methodologies will be 
improved.3 
 
Uncertainties  exist  in  the  adaptation  methodology  used  to  estimate  costs.  These 
methodologies can be further improved and will benefit from exchanges with others using 
similar methodologies.  

                                                                 
3 National policy indicates that the national GHG Emissions Trajectory Range may be reviewed in 
the light of monitoring and evaluation results, technological advances or new science, evidence 
and information.
