THE INTENDED NATIONAL DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS  

THE FEDERATION OF ST. KITTS AND NEVIS 

FOR  

 
 
 
 
The Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is a democratic and sovereign country. The impacts 

of Climate Change are global and St. Kitts and Nevis, along with the International community 

are committed to addressing the adverse effects. In addition, climate change is one of the most 

critical issues facing the Caribbean region and it is already being experienced through rising 

sea levels, increasing mean temperatures and changes in rainfall and weather patterns. All these 

impacts, in many ways, affect the socio-economic development of the country in sectors such 

as St. Kitts and Nevis Tourism, Agriculture and Water. 

 

St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  sustainability,  as  a  nation,  is  dependent  upon  the  collective  and  global 

response to aggressively reduce St. Kitts and Nevis Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). In this 

regard the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis proposes an emissions reduction target of 22% and 

35% of St. Kitts and Nevis GHG emissions projected in the business as usual (BAU) scenario 

for 2025 and 2030 respectively. 

 

The National Conservation and Environmental Protection Act (NCEPA) articulates strategic 

approaches  to  environmental  protection,  and  serves  as  a  framework  for  the  declaration  of 

sensitive ecological and historic sites that presents clearly vulnerability to climate change and 

vulnerability. 

 

 

The  Federation  of  Saint  Kitts  and  Nevis,  hereby  communicates  its  Intended  Nationally 

Determined  Contribution  (iNDC)  towards  achieving  the  UNFCCC  objective  as  set  out  in 

Article 2 of the Convention, and in accordance with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20.

Planning processes   The  iNDC  preparation  has  been  built  upon  from  previous  climate  and 

non-climate activities and includes a consultative process, involving key 

actors to obtain useful information at the sectoral level.  

 

The implementation process is still under discussion to ensure that there 

is  highest  participation  and  ownership  from  the  key  actors.    A  very 

comprehensive  plan  for  the  implementation  phase  must  take  place  to 

track and monitor the policies and measures within the iNDC.

St. Kitts and Nevis' iNDC is conditional and based on the availability of 

financing and technological support.

St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  supports  the  inclusion  of  the  International  Carbon 

Markets and any other Market Mechanisms in a post-2020 agreement on 

climate change and any future emission reductions pre-2020, should be 

accounted as part of our contributions.  

Level  of  ambition 

St.  Kitts  and  Nevis  is  committed  to  tackling  the  adverse  impacts  of 

in iNDC 

climate change. It considers its iNDC to be ambitious and continues to 

exhibit  evidence  of  environmentally  sound  development.  Furthermore, 

St. Kitts and Nevis' inventories of GHGs demonstrate that the country is 

a net sink for global carbon emissions, although like other Small Island 

Developing States, it is expected to bear the brunt of the impacts.  

 

St. Kitts and Nevis proposes to reduce its GHG emissions by focusing on 

electricity  generation  and  the  transport  sector.  Under  its  proposed 

mitigation  actions  it  is  intended  that  the  policies  and  measures  would 

increase  the  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  by  50%,  taking  into 

consideration that this ambitious target could be considered risky within 

the short time frame.  To reduce the risk St. Kitts and Nevis must ensure 

that  the  relevant  policies  and  measures  are  created  within  its  natural, 

financial, technological and human resources to implement the measures 

necessary to achieve the intended emissions reductions.

ADAPTATION CONTRIBUTION  

 

The Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is committed to building resilience and mitigating the 

negative  impacts  of  external  shocks  including  natural  disasters,  according  to  NCEPA,  and 

many others institutional and regulation requirement that have been developed in the country. 

 

For St. Kitts and Nevis the most vulnerable sectors and areas include:  

●  Forestry and Terrestrial Ecosystems  

●  Coastal Ecosystems  

●  Water resources  

●  Human Settlements 

●  Agriculture 

●  Tourism 

●  Human Health  

 

Climate change is one of the major threats for key vulnerable sectors that are linked to vital 

pillars for sustainable development. Forestry and water supply are intimately linked to potable 

water, tourism, and agriculture. Moreover, St. Kitts and Nevis, a twin island state, is abundant 

in nearshore and marine resources which provide the basis for a range of economic and social 

activity relevant to the tourism and fishing industries. Some of these marine resources include 

coral reefs, beaches, mangroves, freshwater lagoons and sea-grass beds. Tourism, water supply 

and  coastal  infrastructure,  are  also  being  affected  by  the  sea-level  rise,  saline  intrusion  and 

flooding. 

 

St. Kitts and Nevis wishes to highlight three areas in its iNDC that are considered important to 

its social and economic sustainability and their interlinkages with others sectors.  

-  Water 

-  Agriculture 

-  Coastal zone   

 

St. Kitts and Nevis plans develop a comprehensive plan to build resilience  in the  following 

sectors:

IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT  

 

St. Kitts and Nevis is aware of the importance of developing a comprehensive plan which must 

serve as the preparation stage for the implementation process. 

 

In order to ensure  the  effective  implementation  of the plan proposed above, the local actors 

must be involved and therefore empowered and prepared to execute the necessary tasks. The 

preparation process  may require, inter alia, technical training, capacity  building workshops, 

expert guidance, and feasibility and technical studies. It is important to highlight the relevance 

of the institutional capacity, as well as the necessary establishment of institutional coordination 

and  political  support  to  meet  the  desired  national  goals.  Furthermore,  technical  and 

economically feasibility studies for all levels of implementation (actions, projects, programs, 

policies), as well as a comprehensive analysis for policy implication would be required. It is 

also  relevant  to  prepare  a  sectorial  financing  plan  with  specific  funding  sources  and 

disbursement planning to implement the necessary policies and measures.
