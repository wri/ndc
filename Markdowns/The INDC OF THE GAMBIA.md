Message from Honourable Pa Ousman Jarju, Minister, 

Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, Forestry, Water and Wildlife 

 

The Republic of The Gambia is fully committed to the multilateral process under the UNFCCC and will 
continue to work with all Parties to negotiate and adopt a New Climate Agreement in Paris in December 
2015 that will be in line with keeping global warming below 2°C to 1.5OC.  
 
Following  the  decision  at  COP  19  in  Warsaw  to  invite  all  UNFCCC  parties  to  develop  their  Intended 
Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (INDCs),  The  Gambia  expressed  a  strong  interest  in  receiving 
technical support to develop their INDCs and received financial and technical support from the German 
Government development agency GIZ and the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN). 
GIZ and CDKN contracted Climate Analytics to provide technical assistance to the INDC Team of The 
Gambia. 
 
On  behalf  of  the  President  of The  Republic  of The Gambia,  Alhagi  Yahya  A.  J. J. Jammeh  and  on  my 
own behalf, I thank the Government of Germany, the CDKN, GIZ and Climate Analytics of Germany for 
the financial and technical support. 
 
The  collaborative  efforts  between  the  Climate  Analytics  Team  and  the  National  INDC  Team  are 
commendable and have been found to be mutually beneficial. 
 
Finally, I must thank Mr. Petes Betts of the UK Delegation to the Climate Change Negotiations for all his 
involvement and efforts in catalyzing the support. 
 
 

Message from Mr. Alpha Jallow 

UNFCCC Focal Point of The Gambia 

Department of Water Resources 

  
The  Republic  of  The  Gambia  has  the  honour  and  pleasure  to  communicate  its  intended  nationally 
determined contribution (INDC)  as part of the implementation of  decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20 of the 
Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC. 
 
Capacity to conduct and submit an economy-wide emissions reduction targets for The Gambia is limited. 
Individual baselines for each sector were developed, using a range of GDP growth scenarios. The medium 
scenario  assumes  growth  rates  of  5.5%  until  2016  and  4.5%  from  2017.  For  population  projections  the 
UN  population  prospectus 2012  medium  fertility  scenario  was  used.  Individual  assumptions  were  made 
for the mitigation options/activities in different sectors 
 
Treatment of the Land Use Land Use-Change and Forestry (LULUCF) emissions category has not been 
considered in the INDC. Excluding LULUCF and for Low Emissions Scenario, overall emissions will be 
reduced by about 44.4% in 2025 and 45.4% in 2030.

1.7: Use of 
market 
mechanism 

1.6: Assumptions  This INDC was prepared using 100 year Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) from 
the  IPCC  4th  assessment  report,  the  IPCC  2006  greenhouse  gas  inventory 
methodologies, and the 2013 IPCC KP Supplement.  
Gambia  has  so  far  not  benefited  from  the  international  market  mechanisms  under 
the Kyoto Protocol. The Gambia does not plan to achieve any of its commitment by 
buying certificates from any potential new market mechanisms. The Gambia would 
be  a  host  country  of  projects  from  any  international  climate  mechanism  aiming  at 
securing  the  protection  of  the  planet  by  meeting  standards  that  deliver  real, 
permanent,  additional  and  verified  mitigation  outcomes,  avoid  double  counting  of 
emissions. Elements of the INDC that are conditional to international support could 
potentially  include  projects  that  are  registered  under  the  new  market  mechanism 
established  under  the  Convention.  Furthermore,  The  Gambia  supports  the 
continuation of the CDM established under the Kyoto Protocol and its continuation 
under the new agreement.  
According  to  preliminary  inventory  data  for  2010  under  the  Third  National 
Communication  (being  developed),  the  Gambia  represented  below  0.01%  of  the 
global  emission  and  as  such  its  contribution  to  climate  change  has  always  been 
marginal.  At first  sight  it  seems  rather unfair  to  ask  a  country  like  The  Gambia to 
contribute to the global emission reduction efforts, which implies that resources to 
be  allocated  to  poverty  reduction  and  development  priorities  will  be  arbitrated  to 
take  into  account  the  requirements  of  the  implementation  of  the  Paris  Agreement. 
The  Gambia  has  always  shown  a  progressive  standpoint  and  commendable 
leadership in the climate change negotiations, as the implications of the current level 
of mitigation ambition is particularly low and likely to pose tremendous challenges 
for  countries  like  Gambia.  Agriculture,  Energy,  Water  Resources,  which  are  vital 
sectors for the Gambian economy will severely suffer if global and deep cut do not 
occur in a near future. For this reason, The Gambia took the leadership and joined 
the  call  in  2011  for  a  universal  mobilization  of  efforts  to  tackle  climate  change 
allowing that global actions protect the future of the most vulnerable countries. By 
presenting  this  INDC,  the  Gambia  would  like  to  provide  a  moral  voice  for  all 
responsible  and  capable  countries  to  undertake  actions  that  are  proportionate  for 
their  responsibilities  and  capabilities  not  only  for  themselves,  but  for  the  whole 
global  community.  The  Gambia  is  an  LDC  and  according  to  the  Lima  Call  for 
Action, it is not mandatory for LDCs to have quantified or quantifiable targets. But 
this  INDC  has  quantified  and  quantifiable  commitment  which  go  beyond  the  fair 
share of The Gambia. Fairness in the context of the most vulnerable countries INDC 
also relates to the way the Paris Agreement will deal with their adaptation needs in a 
post 2020 world. 
Financial  support  from  all  sources  will  be  needed  for  the  implementation  of  this 
INDC.  An  assessment  of  the  implementation  options  is  needed  between  2016  and 
2018.  Potential  sources  will  include,  the  National  Budget  and  proposed  National 
Climate Fund, the financial mechanism of the Convention, bilateral and multilateral 
sources,  other  non-Convention  financial  and  investments  sources,  as  well  as 
international and domestic private finance sources. All these will be facilitated and 
enabled  by  current  and  proposed  public  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  as 
indicated in the section 5, as well national mobilization of finance and investments 
where possible.

Ambition

1.10: 
Implementation 

The Government of The Gambia has in place legislative and policy instruments to 
address  climate  change  and  some  of  these  instruments  have  been  used  in  the 
development of this INDC and will be used for its implementation (see Section 5). 

NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES 

 
2: 
 
The Gambia signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
in 1992 and ratified it in 1994. By so doing, The Gambia is implementing the Climate Change 
Convention and its Kyoto Protocol based on its national circumstances, particularly to support its 
development policies and programmes. Since its ratification of the Convention, The Gambia has 
taken  very  important  steps  to  face  the  challenges  and  address  the  effects  of  climate  change 
through the development, submission and implementation of her National Communications, the 
National  Adaptation  Program  of  Actions  (NAPA),  the  National  Capacity  Self  Assessment 
(NCSA)  and  the  Nationally  Appropriate  Mitigation  Actions  (NAMA).  These  documents  have 
been developed to be in line with the national policies and programmes including VISION 2020, 
the PAGE and relevant sectorial policies, some of which are discussed in Section 5. 
 
As one of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) parties to the UNFCCC, The Gambia is among 
the  nations  that  are  the  least  responsible  for  climate  change,  particularly  vulnerable  to  its 
impacts,  but  the  most  progressive  for  ambitious  international  climate  action.  As  such,  The 
Gambia  has  been  calling  for  all  countries  to  lead  by  example,  making  no  exception  for  the 
development  of  its  INDC.  It  has  often  highlighted  the  opportunities  arising  out  of  the  process, 
allowing countries to leapfrog the „dirty development‟ phase, combining enhanced development 
and growth with an environmentally sustainable path. 
 
Following  the  decision  at  COP20  in  Warsaw  to  invite  all  UNFCCC  parties  to  develop  their 
Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), The Gambia expressed a strong interest 
in  receiving  technical  support  to  develop  their  INDCs  and  received  financial  and  technical 
support from the Governments of Germany and the United Kingdom. The German Government 
development  agency,  GIZ,  and  the  Climate  and  Development  Knowledge  Network  (CDKN) 
provided  technical  and  financial  support.  GIZ  and  CDKN  contracted  Climate  Analytics  to 
provide technical assistance to the INDC Team of The Gambia. 
 
This technical report is the result of the technical support provided towards The Gambia‟s INDC-
development  process.  The  results  from  this  analysis  feed  into  the  political  process  in  The 
Gambia, which ultimately decided on the INDC. The process leading to this technical report and 
providing  additional input towards the political  process  includes the technical  work carried  out 
by  the  consultants,  and  a  national  stakeholder  engagement  process.  To  this  end,  The  Gambia 
carried out national stakeholder consultations on INDC-development in the form of workshops. 
 
Technical  inception  workshop  at  the  senior  technical  expert  level  informed  experts  on  the 
context and planning of the project and the purpose of the activities; and provided input for the 
technical analysis regarding challenges and current status in the different sectors. The workshop 
was attended by 80 experts from ministries, departments, NGOs and the private sector. 
 

 
Local  level  sensitization  workshops  were  held  at  the  country‟s  eight  local  government  areas 
(districts)  and  stakeholders  acquired  knowledge  on  the  issues  related  to  climate  change,  the 
UNFCCC process  and the significance of the  INDC; providing input on appropriate mitigation 
options.  About  120  participants  in  each  district  and  from  all  local  stakeholder  groups 
participated. 
 
Technical training workshop at the senior technical expert level was held to familiarize sector 
experts in The Gambia with the calculation methods and tools used for the INDC development 
and  to  discuss  the  robustness  of  assumptions  made  for  calculations  and  adjust  these  where 
needed.  The  workshop  was  attended  by  25  participants  from  key  ministries,  agencies  and 
institutes for the different sectors. 
 
The  Climate  Analytics  Consultants  and  the  National  INDC  Team  collaborated  in  the  technical 
analysis  leading  to  the  development  of  the  INDC.  The  technical  analysis  only  forms  one  input 
into the process of developing the INDC. Although national priorities, development aspirations 
and technical feasibility were part of the analysis, other considerations influenced priorities and 
level  of  ambition.  The  Technical  Analysis  Report  provides  a  brief  description  of  the  status  of 
activities  in  The  Gambia;  a  short  discussion  of  the  GHG  profile  of  the  country  and  critical 
sectors; the methodological approach taken for baseline development and mitigation analysis; the 
results  obtained  from  the  analysis  per  sector  and  at  the  national  level;  and  two  possible 
approaches for the formulation of the INDC as an input to the political process. This document 
guided the formulation of this INDC.

Unconditional Mitigation Actions 
The  Republic  of  The  Gambia  includes  two 
unconditional  mitigation  options  in  its  INDC: 
Firstly,  the  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  in 
lighting,  communication  and  health  facilities, 
and  for  lifting  water  from  wells  and  boreholes. 
Secondly,  the  Department  of  Forestry  and  local 
communities  will continue  to  plant and care  for 
trees annually. The implementation of renewable 
energy sources will contribute to greenhouse gas 
emission  reductions  of  45.6  GgCO2e  in  2020, 
78.5 GgCO2e in 2025 and 104 GgCO2e in 2030 
whilst afforestation will contribute reductions of 
220.3 GgCO2e in 2020, 275.4 GgCO2e in 2025 
and 330.5 GgCO2e in 2030 (see Figure 3 to the 
right). 
 
 
Emission Reductions at the Sectorial Level 
 
Reductions in the Agricultural Sector 
Under 
two 
conditional  mitigation  options  (NERICA 
Rice  production  and  Rice  efficiency)  have 
been assessed and reported on in this INDC 
(see Figure 4 to the right). For production of 
NERICA  upland  production  in  place  of 
Swamp  Rice, estimated  emission reductions 
are  124.1  GgCO2e  in  2020,  397.7  GgCO2e 
in  2025  and  2030.  For  the  promotion  of 
efficiency 
in  rice  production,  estimated 
emission  reductions  are  437.8  GgCO2e  in 
2020, 707.0 GgCO2e in 2025 and 2030.

Reductions in the Energy Sector
The  energy  supply  mix mainly  consists 
of  traditional  biomass  and  petroleum 
products,  with  biomass  accounting  for 
the  vast  majority.  Petroleum  products 
play  an  important  role  in  the  country‟s 
energy  supply  since  it  is  the  main 
source  of 
transport  and 
electricity  generation,  notwithstanding 
its  negative  environment  consequences. 
In 2010, Total Energy Supply (TES) in 
The  Gambia  was  407,926  tons  of  oil 
equivalents  (toe)  according  to  UNIDO 
figures. As shown in Figure below, five 
conditional  mitigation  options  have 
been  identified  and  analyzed  under  the 
Energy  Sector.  Combined  emissions 
reductions  are  425.7  GgCO2e  in  2020, 
541.1  GgCO2e  in  2025  and  629.6 
GgCO2e in 2030. Figure 5 and Table 1 
to 
the  emission 
reductions per mitigation option. 
 
 
Emission Reductions under Transport Systems 
Of the total CO2 (437.575 Gg) emitted from 
the Energy Sector in 2010 the Transport sub-
sector  accounted 
(MoE/TNC, 
2015).  Only  one  conditional  mitigation 
option  was  analyzed  under  the  Transport 
Sector. As shown in Figure 6, deployment of 
energy  efficient  vehicles  will  produce 
greenhouse  gas  emission  reductions  of  40.8 
GgCO2e  in  2020,  114.5  GgCO2e  in  2025 
and 193.3 GgCO2e in 2030.

Emission Reductions under Waste Management
Inadequate  waste  data  is  a  major  issue, 
regarding  both  GHG  emissions  and  waste 
production, 
for  both  solid  waste  and 
wastewater.  Current  municipal  solid  waste 
generation 
to 
approximately 438 tons/day and is expected 
to  reach  1,295  tons/day  in  2025  (World 

in  The  Gambia  amounts 

 
Bank  2012).  Waste  management  is  a  major 
concern for Gambian Authorities, given that 
roughly  90%  of  waste  is  currently  disposed 
in  open  dumps  (e.g.  Bakoteh  Dump  Site).

in  waste  generation  volume  in  the  future. 
Enhancement of the waste collection system 
is  hindered  by  lack  of  vehicles.  Specialized 
vehicles  are  too  expensive  to  buy  and 
maintain  for  the  municipalities  who  are 
responsible  for  waste  management.  Over 
40%  of  the  population  lives  in  the  Greater 
Banjul  Area 
the 
Government  included  in  its  NAMA  agreed 
list  the  implementation  of  an  Integrated 
Management  initiative  for  solid  and  liquid 
waste  in  the  GBA,  which  is  expected  to 
reduce  emissions  significantly  but  is  also 
associated with an estimated implementation 
cost of USD 68 million.

ADAPTATION UNDERTAKINGS  

 
4: 
 
4.1:  General 
As for all least  developed countries in  sub Saharan Africa, adaptation  constitutes a top  priority 
for  the  Gambia.  However,  the  Gambia  does  not  see  the  INDC,  as  the  vehicle  to  address  its 
adaptation  needs  in  the  post  2020  context,  which  needs  careful  consideration  and  assessment. 
Such assessment will be made in the context of the Gambian NAP process. All necessary efforts 
will be made to engage the country in the formulation and implementation of a comprehensive 
transformational  adaptation  investment  plan  to  protect  the  country‟s  high  vulnerability  against 
climate change. The Gambia expects that the Paris Agreement will make adequate provision to 
enable  international  climate  finance  support  for  effective  adaptation  in  the  most  vulnerable 
countries. 
 
4.2:  Adaptation (national, sub-national and sectoral levels) 
 
In  the  short-term,  for  The  Gambia  to  transition  to  a  low-emissions  and  climate  resilient 
development  pathway,  Government  intends  to  adopt  specific  enabling  conditions  which  must 
consist of national regulations, policies, subsidies and incentives, as well as international market 
and legal infrastructure, trade and technical cooperation. This will be achieved through intensive 
and  extensive  education,  awareness  raising  and  development  and  implementation  of  socio-
economic  research  as  it  relates  to  climate  change.  Currently,  enabling  conditions  are  heavily 

 
weighted towards, and encourage, the prevailing brown economy, which depends excessively on 
fossil fuels, resource depletion and environmental degradation. 
 
In  the  medium-  and  long-term,  the  Government  must  continue  the  mainstreaming  of  climate 
change  into  national  development  frameworks  as  achieved  for  the  medium-term  strategy  -  the 
Programme  for  Accelerated  Growth  and  Employment  (PAGE)  and  some  sectorial  policies  and 
strategies  (the  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Policy,  the  Forest  Policy  and  the  Fisheries 
Strategic Action Plan) by adjusting all national and sectorial policies to take climate change into 
consideration.  With appropriate changes in the policies, including fiscal policy, the fostering of 
public 
to  green  key  sectors  (agriculture,  energy,  water  resources,  waste 
management, etc.); employment of new market-based instruments; greening public procurement; 
improving  environmental  rules  and  regulations,  as  well  as  their  enforcement;  improving  trade 
and aid flows; and fostering greater international cooperation can be easily achieved. 
 
Specific examples of short-term and medium-term activities that The Gambia plans to include in 
her proposed Low Emissions Climate Resilient Development Strategy (LECRDS) and National 
Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) to implement the LECRDS include but not limited to: 
 

investments 

1.  Improve  the  Climate  and  Climate  Change  Resilient  urban  and  peri-urban 
infrastructure  of  the  Gambia  including  (a)  water  supply  infrastructure  in  Greater 
Banjul  Area;  (b)  addressing  infrastructural  deficiencies  of  Sanitation  services  in 
Kanifing  Municipality  and  Brikama  Area  Council;  (c)  developing  and  applying 
infrastructure construction and management codes/guidelines under climate change; 
(d)  strengthening  climate  robustness  of  public  and  commercial  sector  buildings  in 
Greater  Banjul  Area;  and  (e)  improved  road  infrastructure  and  drainage  systems. 
The  implementation  of  this  activity  will  lead  to  (a)  increased  access  to  potable  water, 
integrated  water  management  policy,  greater  water  security  for  communities,  increased 
protection of infrastructure from extreme climate events; (b) decreased impact of drought 
on domestic and agricultural water availability; (c) decreased waterborne diseases due to 
flooding  and  more  sustainable  and  climate  resilient  settlements;  (d)  development  and 
applications  of  planning  codes/guidelines 
that  are  climate  change  oriented  (e) 
strengthened vulnerable  infrastructure in  GBA; (f) improved resilience of road networks 
under  changing  climate;  and  (g)  reduced  effect  of  floods  on  the  Greater  Banjul  Area 
(GBA). 

 

 

2.  Adapting  the Agriculture System to Climate Change in The Gambia will strengthen 
diversified  and  sustainable  livelihood  strategies  for  reducing  the  impacts  of  climate 
variability  and  change  in  agriculture  and  livestock  sectors  of  The  Gambia.  In  additon  to 
institutional strengthening, climate change adaptation priorities will be mainstreamed into 
national  agriculture  and  livestock  policies,  plans  and  programmes;  value  addition  of 
products  will be promoted to  complement and support crop diversification;  vulnerability 
and  risk  assessment  tools  and  agro-climatic  monitoring  and  early  warning  for  food 
security  will  be  improved;  climate  information  services  to  the  agriculture  sector  and 
dissemination  to  wider  rural  communities  will  be  promoted;  livelihoods  and  sources  of 
income  for  vulnerable  communities  in  5  Administrative  Regions  of  the  country  will  be 
diversified; sustainable crop intensification will be enabled by introducing innovative crop 
improvement  and  management  practices;  implementation  of  poultry,  small-ruminantes 
and cattle production at the local level will be improved; and sustainable livelihoods and 
soil  and  water  management  interventions  to  improve  vegetative  cover  and  to  sustain 
livelihoods of livestock dependent communities will be expanded and intensified.  

3.  The mainstreaming of climate change in all national  development frameworks  will 
be  continued.  With  financial  and  technical  support  from  the  CDKN,  climate  change 
issues  and  risks  have  successfully  been  integrated  in  the  Programme  for  Accelerated 
Growth and Employment (PAGE: 2012 - 2015) as a crosscutting theme. Some activities 
identified  and  included  in  the  Climate  Change  Priority  Action  Plan  (CCPAP)  to 
implement  the  PAGE  are  being  implemented  and  are  thus  enabling  mainstreaming  of 
climate  change  into  the  national  development  process.  Development  of  the  follow-up 
medium-term strategy has started and the following activities will be carried forward. 
*  Mainstreaming of Climate Change into Education Curricula: Education, training 
and  public  awareness  constitute  the  first  pillar  of  mainstreaming.  The  Government 
enjoyed several achievements in education and the country is on track to achieve the 
education MDG target for net enrolment in primary education and literacy rate among 
the population aged 15-24 years. However, the issue of knowledge and education on 
climate  change  remains  a  challenge.  Therefore,  the  Government  will  continue 
prioritizing basic/primary education, while expanding access to secondary, higher and 
tertiary education with emphasis on climate change. Integration of climate change in 
all  education  curricula  will  support  the  achievement  of  sustainable  development  in 
The Gambia. 

*  Integration of Climate Change into Sectorial Policies: With the understanding that 
integration is the first step to mainstreaming climate change in national development 
processes, Government initiated and has completed the integration of climate change 
into  the  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Policy,  the  Forest  Policy,  and  the 
Fisheries Strategy and Action Plan. The integration of climate change in all policies, 
strategies,  plans  and  programmes/projects  will  be  necessary  for  mainstreaming 
climate change. Of particular importance is the integration of climate change into the 
public  budgeting  system  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Planning. 
Taking  climate  change  fully  into  consideration  in  the  national  budgeting  system 
allows  climate  proofing  of  all  activities  and  programmes  and  thus  determines 
allocation of funds to those activities and programmes that are less contaminative. 
 

 

 

4.  The  planning,  development  and 

implementation  of  an  effective  disaster 
preparedness  and  response  strategy  in  support  of  climate  change  adaptation  and 
loss  and  damage  is  a  critical  activity  to  develop  and  implement.  Critical  gaps  and 
constraints exist in terms of human capacity, low awareness of the economic benefits of 
disaster  risk  reduction,  low  resilience  of  infrastructure  and  facilities,  inadequate  slum 
upgrade,  lack  of  appropriate  building  codes  and  land  use  planning,  and  inadequate 
funding to enable the utilization of disaster preparedness and risk reduction in support of 
climate  change  adaptation  and  future  loss  and  damage.  To  reduce  the  risk  and 
vulnerabilities of the country and communities, the proposed activity will:  
* 
*  Strengthen disaster risk reduction institutions through institutional strengthening and 

Integrate disaster risk reduction with climate change adaptation; 

capacity building; 

*  Strengthen disaster risk reduction at the local level; 
* 
* 

Improve and reinforce proper building codes and land use planning; 

Integrate  disaster  risk  reduction  into  the  formal  and  informal  education  system  and 
health sector; 

*  Harmonize and re-align partner interventions towards disaster risk reduction; 
*  Strengthen the climate change early warning systems; and 
*  Empower young people as advocates for disaster risk reduction. 

5.  Build and strengthen national capacities to promote and facilitate medium and long-
term climate change adaptation planning and implementation. The proposed activity 
will support national systems to integrate climate and development and to plan effectively 
and  allocate  finance,  as  well  as  identify  appropriate  sources  of  finance  and  policy 
mechanisms. The activity will build and strengthen institutional and technical capacities 
and  knowledge  brokering  for  climate  change  adaptation  planning  and  the  integration  of 
adaptation  within,  or  aligned  with,  current  development  planning  and  budgeting 
processes. The process will  
* 
*  Forge linkages with other on-going initiatives;  
*  Make tools and approaches available to national partners; and  
*  Share lessons learned and knowledge. 

Identify information and capacity gaps;  

6.  Climate-proofing  of  the  Urban  and  peri-urban  infrastructure  in  the  Brikama  and 

Greater Banjul Areas to be implemented in phases and divided into: 
 
Component 1: Water supply, Sanitation and Waste Management; 
Component  2:  Public  works  infrastructure  (roads,  bridges,  communication,  etc.)  in 

Brikama and Greater Banjul Areas; 
 

 

 

Component  3:  Climate  Resilience  of  Public  and  Commercial  Buildings  in  Brikama  and 

Greater Banjul Area; 

 

7.  Enhancing Resilience of coastal and estuarine/riverine economies and livelihoods of 
the  districts  in  the  coastal  zone  by  reducing  their  vulnerability  to  sea-level  rise  and 
associated  impacts  of  climate  change  of  Gambia‟s  most  important  coastal  economic 
development  assets,  notably  the  tourism  infrastructures  of  the  Kololi  coastline  and  the 
lowland rice growing landscapes of the districts of Jokadu and Upper Baddibu. 
 

8.  Climate Change Adaptation through large scale ecosystem restoration of the River 

Gambia Watershed by: 
a)  Improving disaster preparedness and decrease the effect of disasters at seven hotspots 

identified under the 2012 study by the National Disaster Management Agency; 

b)  Promoting  access  to  community  markets  by  improving  climate  resilience  of 
infrastructure  and  transport  through  the  rehabilitation  and  development  of  critical 
road and transport infrastructure; 

c)  Establishing  food  processing  and  preservation  plants  close  to  communities  and 

markets; 

d)  Improving long term planning and management through development of national and 
sub-national  land  use  policies  and  plans  for  crop  and  livestock  production; 
management  of  agro-pastoral 
transhumances; 
enrichment  and  management  of  rangelands  and  appropriate  farm  mechanization  and 
establishing irrigation schemes. 

infrastructure  and  control  of 

9.  Development  and  Implementation  of  the  National  Climate  Policy  and  Strategy  of 

The Gambia 
 
The overall objective is  to  contribute to  the capability of the  government and people of 
The  Gambia  to  mainstream  climate  change  into  development  planning.  The  outcomes 
include  (a)  an  established  national  climate  change  policy;  (b)  rationalised  institutional 
arrangements  and  inter-sector  coordination  mechanisms  for  climate  change;  and  (c) 
strengthened  decision  makers'  climate  change  response  capacity.  On-going  activities 
include  definition  of  guiding  principles  and  roadmap  to  develop  an  overarching  policy 
document;  definition  of  a  national  climate  change  policy  and  Low  emissions  climate 
resilient  development  strategy  (LECRDS);  institutional  analysis,  and  development  of 
recommendations for institutional arrangements; establishment of climate change related 
inter-institutional  coordination  mechanisms;  and  sensitisation  and  training  on  the 
relationship between climate change and development. 
 
 
 

 

10. Establishment of the National Climate Change Fund of The Gambia. 

The development of the Policy and LECRDS of The Gambia has taken into consideration 
the  financial  requirements  to  implement  the  on-going  and  proposed  activities  in  the 
implementation  of  the  Convention,  its  Kyoto  Protocol  and  the  future  Climate  Region 
from  2021. The Government of The Gambia, as a matter of priority, intends to  create a 
Gambia Climate Change Fund (GCCF) by: 
a)  Conducting  detailed  analysis  of  current  and  future  activities  and  programmes  of  the 

LECRDS and the full cost of its implementation; 

b)  Designing the GCCF based on the detailed analysis above; 
c)  Establishing  a  multi-stakeholder  Task  Force  to  steer  the  process  of  establishing  the 

GCCF; 

d)  Conducting  nationwide  stakeholder  consultation  and  sensitization  about  the  Green 

Climate Fund (GCF), its mandate, and the target date for the launch of operations; 

e)  Developing  and  adopting  key  policies,  guidelines,  procedures  and  templates  for  the 

management of the Fund; 

f)  Establishing the institutional structures to management the Fund; 
g)  Convening a climate finance pledging conference that will include public and private 

sectors, bilateral and multilateral development partners and investment partners; 

h)  Prioritizing  climate  funding  within  the  national  budget  and  harmonising  funding 

requirements, and efforts to improve the capacity of the funds; 

i)  Creating  climate  change  line  items  and  codes  in  the  IFMIS  and  national  budget  to 

allow climate change budgets to be tracked and reported; 

j)  Improving the capacities of stakeholders to absorb climate finance; 
k)  Standardizing the financial requirements and fiscal calendars of the government and 
development  partners  and  establishing  the  processes  by  which  development  agency 
and  government  resources  are  provided  to  the  Fund  through  a  joint  financing 
agreement; 

l)  Institutionalizing  strong  financial  management  capabilities  to  improve  project 
proposal preparation, disbursement and project implementation and compliance with 
accounting and reporting requirements; 

m)  Encourage  public-private-partnership  and  the  active  participation  of  the  Gambia 
Chamber of Commerce in climate finance so as to have access to the Private Sector 
Facility of the GCF; 

n)  Enhancing  the  capacity  of  the  Budget  Directorate  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and 

Economic Affairs, which is serving as the DNA of the GCF in The Gambia; and 

o)  Establishing  a  regular  platform  for  continued  engagement  and  dialogue  between  the 
Government  of  The  Gambia  and  both  domestic  and  international  representatives  of 
the private sector on matters relating to the LECRDS. 

 
 

 
5:  MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
 
5.1:  Finance 
 
During  the  development  of  this  INDC  an  economic  assessment  was  conducted.  The  national 
climate  change  reports  (NCSA,  NOTCOMs,  NAPA,  NAMAs,  etc)  also  contain  some  costs 
identified for implementation of identified activities. 
 
Based  on  the  economic  assessment  under  this  INDC,  investments  in  renewable  technologies 
(wind  and  solar)  are  highly  beneficial  for  The  Gambia.  The  upfront  cost  of  renewables  is 
identified  as  major  challenge  for  the  Gambia,  due  to  inadequate  financial  resources.  However, 
under a real discount rate of 10% per year, renewables emerge as the most profitable option, with 
an  associated  negative  carbon  price,  ranging  between  -7  to  -20  US$/tCO2e,  depending  on  the 
scenarios  (high  or  low  demand).  The  economic  analysis  suggests  that  even  higher  shares  of 
renewable  electricity  generation  through  solar  PV  and  wind  are  feasible  in  The  Gambia. 
Limitations to this are likely arising from the available finance for high up-front cost. Additional 
cost related to grid adjustments for this purpose is not considered in the analysis and would need 
to  be  assessed  for  higher  shares  of  renewables.  Methane  capture  in  landfills  also  provides 
substantial  mitigation  potential  at  low  cost.  The  associated  cost  is  in  the  range  of  0.34-0.36 
US$/tCO2e. 
 
Transitioning  to  a  climate  resilient  economy  will  also  come  at  a  cost  that  will  be  beyond  the 
reach of The Gambia, as a Least Developed Country (LDC). However, the cost of doing nothing 
now will be astronomical in the long term. Financing for the transitioning to low emissions and 
climate resilient economy in The Gambia is required for investment in all sectors but particularly 
in  energy,  agriculture  and  waste  management  sectors.  In  the  energy  sector  investments  will  be 
directed to the transport sub-sector and in energy efficiency in buildings. Priority should be given 
to renewable sources such as solar and wind. Priority financing should be given to public sector 
infrastructure  investments  that  are  critical  to  the  transition  to  the  green  economy.  Households 
should also  be  a major target  of financing, particularly  to support  energy  efficient housing and 
appliances. 
 
Developing  countries  have  insisted  in  various  fora  on  the  principle  of  "adequate,  new  and 
additional" 
including 
environmental  activities,  to  which  the  concept  of  predictability  should  be  added.  Presently, 
finance  to  support  activities  aimed  at  addressing  climate  change  in  developing  countries  is 
generated and delivered by an array of different agents, including the Green Climate Fund (GCF) 
and  Global  Environment  Facility  (for  the  UNFCCC),  multilateral  and  bilateral  development 
banks  (or  "finance  institutions"),  bilateral  development  cooperation  agencies  and  the  private 
sector.  While  much  public  focus  to  date  has  been  on  the  contributions  made  through  the 

sustainable  development, 

international 

financial 

resources 

for 

 
UNFCCC and the multilateral finance institutions, rather less attention has been paid to financial 
flows emanating from the bilateral finance institutions. However, these institutions have a long 
history  in  financing  development  activities  and,  more  recently,  have  also  generated  sizeable 
flows  in  support  of  mitigation  and  adaptation.  The  Gambia  intends  to  continue  to  use  these 
international  financial  sources  to  access  climate  finance  to  support  the  implementation  of  her 
INDC and climate change in general. 
 
Sub-regional  development  banks  such  as  the  African  Development  Bank  (AfDB)  and  national 
development  banks  may  serve  as  alternative  climate  change  funding  channels  for  long-term 
investment in The Gambia. These banks can play an increasingly important role in assisting The 
Gambia  with  a  successful  transition  to  low-emission  climate-resilient  development  pathways. 
However, success on engaging national financial institutions in climate change has not met with 
the  required  success  in  The  Gambia.  The  adoption  of  the  Green  Climate  Fund  and  the 
establishment  of  the  Africa  Climate  Change  Fund  offer  new  opportunities  and  initiatives  to 
access financial support. The Directorate of Budget  (DoB) of the Ministry of Finance has been 
nominated as the Designated National Authority of the GCF and will collaborate and coordinate 
with  the  Gambia  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (GCCI)  to  facilitate  Gambia‟s  access  to 
the Private Sector Facility (PSF) of the GCF. 
 
For  sustainable  funding  of  climate  change  in  The  Gambia,  the  Government  proposes  the 
establishment  of  a  National  Climate  Change  Fund  to  raise  innovative  sources  of  domestic 
climate  finance.  As  with  similar  funds  in  some  developing  countries,  the  Fund  will  include 
existing  national  funds/financial  programmes  with  similar  objectives  but  disparate  governance 
and  accountability  arrangements,  and  blend  these  resources  with  multiple  complementary 
international  and  national  resources  for  specific  sectors/projects.  The  resources  from  the  Fund 
can also be used to leverage international public finance and private finance. Actions to promote 
low-emission and climate-resilient development must be largely public policy-based and private-
sector  financed  where  international  public  finance  is  used  catalytically  alongside  much  larger 
capital  flows.  The  strategy  for  continuous  replenishment  of  the  fund  will  be  developed.  Public 
Private  Partnerships  (PPP)  will  be  facilitated  to  enable  the  contribution  of  the  private  sector  in 
the financing climate change implementation. 
 
For Long Term Finance and for consideration under the New Climate Regime to be adopted in 
Paris  in  December  2015,  Gambia  proposes  adjustments  in  the  climate  finance  architecture.  In 
macroeconomic  terms,  priority  should  be  given  to  financing  programs  that  generate  strong 
synergies  with  domestic  efforts.  Perhaps  the  most  important  are  global  financial  efforts  that 
facilitate the free or low cost access to technology: global financial technology funds that create 
knowledge that is made available as a public good, public sector purchase of relevant technology 
that  is  also  made  freely  available,  technical  assistance  in  building  technology  capabilities,  and 
human capital  formation. A second  area may be  mechanisms that facilitate long-term  domestic 

 
financing  in  The  Gambia,  thus  overcoming  its  short-term  bias,  for  example  using  the 
capitalization  of  multilateral  development  banks  (e.g.,  the  AfDB)  to  expand  considerably  their 
bond issuance and lending in the domestic currencies of the developing countries, and to support 
activities  that  contribute  to  domestic  financial  development  in  these  countries,  particularly 
domestic development banks‟ capacity to extend the maturities of available domestic financing. 
An  additional  area  that  may  become  very  attractive  is  the  design  of  global  disaster  relief  and 
disaster insurance facilities to  manage  climate disasters. Such facilities could  include insurance 
premiums  with  a  grant  component  that  could  vary  according  to  the  level  of  development  of 
countries, such as The Gambia. 
 
5.2:  Technology Development and Transfer 
 
Technology  transfer  is  seen  to  play  a  critical  role  in  the  global  response  to  the  challenge  of 
climate  change.    Technology  transfer  is  a  broad  set  of  processes  covering  the  flows  of  know-
how, experience and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change amongst different 
stakeholders  such  as  governments,  private  sector  entities,  financial  institutions,  NGOs  and 
research/education  institutions.  The  broad  and  inclusive  term  "transfer"  encompasses  diffusion 
of  technologies  and  technology  cooperation  across  and  within  countries.    It  comprises  the 
process of learning to understand, utilize and replicate the technology, including the capacity to 
choose and adapt to local conditions and integrate it with indigenous technologies (Bert Metz et 
al, 2001). 
 
During  the  development  of  its  Second  National  Communication  to  the  UNFCCC,  The  Gambia 
identified  the  technical  and  technological  requirements  for  the  implementation  of  the  Climate 
Change  Convention  and  its  Kyoto  Protocol.  The  Gambia  will  also  continue  to  assess  and 
determine her technological  requirements to  implement  the Convention and any  future Climate 
Regime to be agreed in Paris. 
 
Technologies identified and technology transfer requirements (GoTG/SNS, 2013) which will also 
be needed for the implementation of the INDC include: 
 

1.  Climate monitoring, forecasting and dissemination techniques and technologies; 
2.  Energy efficient technologies (High efficiency lighting, Fluorescent lighting technology, 

Industrial Energy Efficiency Technologies, Fuel Efficiency Technologies; 

3.  Solar Photovoltaic Technology; 
4.  Wind Energy (wind mills); 
5.  Biomass Energy Sources and Technologies (Improved Cook Stoves); 
6.  Bio-energy Technology for the Transport sector; 
7.  Waste  Management  Technologies 

(Landfill  methane  capture  and  Composting 

technologies); 

 
8.  Irrigation Techniques and Technologies (Surface Irrigation Systems, Sprinkler irrigation 

systems, Drip Irrigation); 

9.  Crop  Types  and  Cultivars  (Deep-rooted,  salt-tolerant  tree/grass  species,  Flood  tolerant 

crop species); 

10. Post harvest, food processing and preservation techniques and technologies (Drying food 
preservation, Food preservation freezing, Vacuum packing Food preservation, Canning 
and bottling food preservation); 

11. Rain water harvesting and Water Treatment technologies; 
12. Aquaculture; and 
13. Coastal  Protection  Technologies  (Groynes,  Sea  walls,  Offshore  breakwaters  and 

revetments) 

 
The Gambia would require international and south-south cooperation, collaboration and support 
for the development of its own technologies as well as for technology transfer and innovation to 
increase its mitigation and adaptive capacities.  
 
5.3:  Capacity Building 
 
In  the  implementation  of  her  INDC,  The  Gambia  will  require  support  and  collaboration  on 
capacity building and enhancement at the individual, institutional and systemic levels. 
 
Capacity building on data identification, collection, processing, documentation and archiving has 
been highly achieved in the area of hydrology and meteorology but support would be needed to 
attain  same  or  level  of  achievement  in  other  climate  related  areas  and  sectors.  Although  there 
have  been  a  lot  of  improvements  in  acquiring  and  installing  state-of-the-art  technologies  and 
infrastructure  for  climate  monitoring  in  The  Gambia  under  the  NAPA  early  warning  projects, 
human  capital  to  continue  maintaining  and  monitoring  climate  and  weather  is  inadequate.  The 
National  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  Services  (NMHS)  will  need  to  treble  its  number  of 
professional staff, increase its middle cadre by 50% and redeploy most junior staff after training 
on new technologies, tools and procedures. Under the status quo, the immediate need is to recruit 
professionals and to train weather forecasters and hydrologists. The NMHS needs to develop and 
diligently pursue a  fund-raising strategy that integrates cost-sharing, cost  recovery, competitive 
bidding for international research grants and other innovative ideas as may be forthcoming over 
the years. 
 
A  science  and  policy-relevant  framework  for  examining  global  change  and  local  adaptation 
questions  needs  to  be  developed  quite  soon  to  make  optimal  use  of  favourable  developments 
nationally  and  internationally.  This  strategic  framework  has  to  be  sufficiently  broad  to  include 
physical  and  social  sciences  and  their  interactions.  Important  considerations  include  data  gap 
minimization,  cost  sharing  and  cost  recovery,  alliancing  and  partnerships  and  the  use  of 

 
(IT) 

to  boost 

technologies 

research  productivity.  Tentatively, 

technical 
information 
upgrading/technological  transformation  of  data  collection  networks  should  be  completed  by 
2018.  By  2025,  Gambian  researchers  and  scientists  should  be  in  a  position  to  conduct 
joint/collaborative research in a broad spectrum of thematic areas. 
 
While the legal basis for education service delivery responds to upholding the right of everybody 
to  quality  basic  education,  as  contained  in  the  1997  Constitution  of  The  Gambia,  there  is 
empirical evidence to suggest that the provision of such education to any population lays a strong 
foundation for the sustainable development of any country (MoFEA/PAGE, 2011). It is for this 
reason  that  the  Ministry  of  Basic  and  Secondary  Education  (MoBSE)  continues  to  be 
preoccupied with the execution of its mandate to deliver quality education in the areas of early 
childhood development  (ECD), basic education,  adult and non-formal  education and secondary 
education. Higher and tertiary education is also a key factor in human capital formation with the 
mandate of producing an informed, skilful and disciplined workforce. Capacity building needs to 
include the enhancement  of curricula  for lower and upper basic cycles and the tertiary level  of 
education.  As  the  National  Education  curricula  are  currently  being  reviewed,  financial  and 
technical support would be required to integrate climate change and other environmental issues 
into the curricula. This will be the starting point for the mainstreaming climate change into basic 
and  higher  education  curricular  and  the  development  and  institutionalization  of  specialized 
training programmes in higher education as is proposed in the PAGE (1012-2015). 
 
National  capacity  to  carry  out  earth  system  and  global  change  research  is  quite  low  in  The 
Gambia. The organizational history and status of the NMHS as a non-university institution with 
some research tasks has  not  contributed significantly to  the  generation  of knowledge on  global 
change,  socio-environmental  vulnerabilities,  mitigation  science,  or  adaptation  practices.  Most 
significantly, brain  gain/drain  ratios in  the public sector have deteriorated since the mid-1980s. 
National  research  on  climate  change  is  largely  driven  by  individual  efforts  and  interests  in  the 
wide universe of issues related to global change. Strong collaborative ties forged with the Earth 
Institute,  Columbia  University,  allow  the  UTG  students  and  faculty  access  to  programmatic 
support.  Under  the  German  Climate  Change  initiative,  the  Max  Planck  Research  Institute  and 
some  German  universities  offer  formal  academic 
internships  and  e-learning 
opportunities  to  young  Gambian  scientists.  The  Government  plans  to  embark  on  research  and 
provision  of  higher  education  on  climate  change-related  disciplines,  such  as  adapted  land  use, 
and integrate climate change into the primary, secondary, tertiary and higher education curricula 
as  the  education  sectors  contribution  to  the  proposed  national  climate  change  strategy  of  The 
Gambia (MoFEA/PAGE, 2011).

AND 

 
The  Government  of  The  Gambia  has  in  place  legislative  and  policy  instruments  to  address 
climate change and some of these instruments have been used to develop this INDC and will be 
used for its implementation. 
 
The Government of The Gambia is committed to reducing poverty and improving the wellbeing 
of its population and this commitment is driven by the government‟s long-term strategy, Vision 
2020. The goal of Vision 2020 is  "to transform The Gambia into a financial centre, a tourist 
paradise,  a  trading  export-oriented  agricultural  and  manufacturing  nation,  thriving  on  free 
market  policies  and  a  vibrant  private  sector,  sustained  by  a  well-educated,  skilled,  healthy, 
self-reliant  and  enterprising  population,  guaranteeing  a  well-balanced  ecosystem  and  a 
descent standard of living for all, under a system of government based on the consent of the 
citizenry." Vision 2020 is being executed through a series of five-year development plans. 
 
The Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE) is the current medium-
term development strategy and investment programme for 2012 to 2015. The principal objective 
of the PAGE is to  accelerate growth  and employment in order to sustain  economic growth and 
reinforce  gains  in  welfare.  PAGE  takes  the  new  domestic  and  international  economic  context 
into  consideration  and  climate  change  is  fully  integrated  into  all  the  five  pillars  that  encourage 
and  promote  sustainable  development  and  low  carbon  pathway.  The  PAGE  is  currently  being 
reviewed. 
 
The  National  Environmental  Management  Act  (NEMA)  was  enacted  in  1994  and  provides 
the  legal  framework  for  the  control  and  management  of  the  environment.  NEMA  makes 
provisions for the overall management of the coastal zone and all other wetlands. The priorities 
identified  for  a  sound  environmental  management  can  be  summarized  as:  (i)  improvement  and 
strengthening  the  institutional  framework  for  environmental  management;  (ii)  mainstreaming 
environment issues in policy and planning processes;(iii) strengthening environmental regulatory 
framework  and  enforcing  the  regulatory  codes,  and  environmental  regulations  fully;    (iv) 
Ensuring the functioning of institutional and legal frameworks for sustainable management and 
protection  of  the  coastal  zone  and  its  resources;  (v)  strengthening  environmental  advocacy  and 
sensitisation  for  sustainable  development;  (vi)  ensuring  the  participation  of  the  private  sector, 
CSO,  Non-Governmental  Organization,  and  youth  and  women‟s  groups  in  sustainable  natural 
resource  consumption;  (vii)  supporting  decentralisation  and  Local  Government  Reform  for 
community based natural resource management and sustainable development planning; and (viii) 
improving environmental quality monitoring and enforcement and solid waste management. 
 
 

 
The Energy Sector Instruments relevant to the preparation/implementation of this INDC 
There are  a number of existing and planned policies and strategies in  the energy sector of The 
Gambia  geared  toward  promoting  low  carbon  development  and  reducing  carbon  emissions  for 
sustainable  social  and  economic  development.  Climate  change  mitigation  policies  could 
discourage  unsustainable  use  of  fossil  fuels  while  promoting  renewable  energy  and  energy 
efficiency  in  electricity  generation,  transmission  and  use.  However,  the  success  of  energy 
policies  depends  on  institutional  capacity  building,  the  removal  of  financial  barriers,  and  the 
development  of  strong  legal  framework  with  sufficient  regulatory  stability.  International  and 
regional cooperation, collaboration and support are required. 
 
Below is an overview of the policies and measures for mitigating climate change in the energy 
sector: 

(a)  National  Energy  Policy,  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  (2014  -  2018)  is  popularizing  the 
use of RE technologies, facilitate donor intervention in the provision of  grants, interest-
free  loans  as  well  as  fiscal  incentives  for  the  acquisition  of  renewable  energy  devices, 
implement  RE  law  recommendations  for  feed-in-tariffs  to  attract  investment  in  the  RE 
power plants, and publish FiT to give confidence to investors. 

(b) National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) of The Gambia (2015-2020/2030) 
provides scenarios for the contribution of energy efficiency in the electricity and cooking 
sectors were developed. The analysis of the simulation results provided sectorial energy 
efficiency  targets  in  2020  and  2030  which  are  adopted  as  what  The  Gambia  intends  to 
achieve  by  2020  and  2030  as  contribution  to  the  attainment  of  the  EEP‟s  targets.  The 
sectoral categories include efficient lighting, high performance distribution of electricity, 
energy  efficiency  standards  and  labelling,  buildings  and  Industry.  The  effective 
implementation  of  the  energy  efficiency  targets  and  trajectories  will  depend  on  the 
appropriateness of the measures and activities it adopts to create an enabling environment 
for  actors.  Some  of  the  key  elements  of  such  an  enabling  environment  include  a  well-
conceived  policy  regime;  a  vibrant  institutional,  legal  and  regulatory  framework; 
mechanisms  for  incentive  planning  of  rules  and  behaviour;  responsive  organizational 
arrangements;  and  a  well-designed  regime  of  inducements  and  deterrents  for  individual 
actions. Thus, measures and activities are proposed in (a) efficient lighting; (b) standards 
and  labeling;  (c)  energy  efficient  building;  (d)  electricity  distribution;  (e)  cooking 
initiatives;  (f)  energy  efficiency  in  the  industrial  sector;  (g)  energy  efficiency  in  the 
transport  sector;  (h)  other  sectors  (agriculture  fisheries,  etc.);  and  (i)  cross-cutting 
measures.  The  national  authority  for  the  follow-up  of  the  National  Energy  Efficiency 
Action  Plan  is  the  Ministry  of  Energy.  A  monitoring  system,  including  indicators  for 
individual measures and instruments, will be developed with the support of ECREEE, in 
order  to  follow-up  the  implementation  of  the  National  Energy  Efficiency  Action  Plan 
(NEEAP). 

 
(c)  National  Investment  Program  on  Access  to  Energy  in  The  Gambia  (2013  -  2020) 
will  increase  access  to  energy  services  for  rural,  urban  and  peri-urban  populations  by 
2020. 

(d) Renewable Energy Act, 2013 is designed to promote the use of RES in order to achieve 
greater energy self-reliance which will thus  reduce the nation‟s exposure to fossil fuels, 
harmful emissions and the demand burden in regards to the supply of electricity; establish 
a  Renewable  Energy  Fund;  encourage  investment  into  the  RE  sector;  and  ensure 
appropriate  training  and  certification  of  installers  of  RE  equipment  and  provision  of 
guarantees to clients 

(e)  Sustainable  Energy  for  All  (SE4ALL)  Action  Agenda  and  Investment  Prospectus 
(2015  -  2030)  is  the  country‟s  plan  of  action  to  achieve  the  set  of  SE4ALL  goals  by 
2030. SE4ALL is a global initiative led by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 
Ban  Ki-moon  to  achieve  universal  energy  access,  improve  energy  efficiency,  and 
increase the use of renewable energy. It was launched to coincide with the designation of 
2012  as  the  International  Year  of  Sustainable  Energy  for  All  by  the  UN  General 
Assembly in December 2010.The Investment Prospectus is designed to operationalize the 
SE4ALL  Action  Agenda  for  The  Gambia  by  identifying  and  developing  a  set  of 
implementable  programs  and  projects,  including  their  investment  requirements.  The 
investment prospectus features a number of projects that promote renewable energy and 
energy  efficiency.  These  projects,  if  implemented,  will  contribute  to  climate  change 
mitigation efforts. 

 
The  National  Disaster  Management  Policy  brought  disaster  management  issues  including 
climate change and its impacts into the limelight and has introduced adaptive mechanisms at the 
community  level.  The  Policy  advocates  for  efficient  response  mechanisms  to  disaster 
management  and developing an institutional  framework and building capacities at  the national, 
regional and local levels to respond to disasters in a timely fashion. The overall objective of the 
policy  is  to  build  safe  and  resilient  communities  by  enhancing  the  use  of  and  access  to 
knowledge  and  information  in  disaster  prevention  and  management  at  all  levels  of  society. 
Climate change adaptation is fully integrated into the Policy. 
 
The Decentralization Act and Policy places emphasis on localization of development activities 
including the strengthening of human and institutional capacities on a country-wide basis. In the 
area of climate change, integration of climate change responses into the Decentralization Policy 
and  the  District  and  Village  Development  Plans  will  be  initiated  in  2016.  The  Department  of 
Water Resources (the UNFCCC Focal Secretariat) is working with the Municipal and Regional 
Administrative  structures  such  as  the  Office  of  the  Mayors,  Office  of  the  Regional  Governors, 
the  Regional  Technical  Advisory  Committee  (TAC)  and  the  Regional  Multidisciplinary 
Facilitation Teams (MDFTs) to enhance access to climate and climate change information by the 
local communities who are the most vulnerable to climate variability and change. 

 
 
The Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR) Policy (2009 - 2015) (GOTG/ANR, 2009) is 
the  medium  term  policy  for  the  Agriculture  (Crops,  Livestock,  Horticulture,  etc.)  and  Natural 
Resources (Environment, Fisheries, Forestry, Parks and Wildlife and Water Resources) sectors. 
It  combines  policy,  institutional,  infrastructure  and  technology  related  measures  to  address  the 
multiplicity of supply-side constraints of Gambian agriculture.  The overall objective of the ANR 
is  to  increase  the  agriculture  sector‟s  contribution  to  the  national  economy  by  increasing 
productivity  through  commercialization  and  greater  private  sector  participation  predicated  on  a 
sound macroeconomic framework aimed at enhanced growth and employment creation. In 2014, 
climate change was integrated into the ANR Policy and efforts are underway to revise the Policy. 
 
Other  relevant  policies  include  the  Fisheries  (2012  -  2015),  Forestry  (2009  -  2019),  Water 
(2009  -  2019)  and  Biodiversity  and  Wildlife  Management  policies. 
Resources 
Complementary  policies  also  exist  for  nutrition  (2010  -  2020)  and  gender  (2010  -  2020).  The 
objective of the Forestry Policy is  to  maintain 30 percent  of the total  land area of The Gambia 
under  forest  cover  and  thus  increase  the  carbon  sink  of  the  country.  The  Fisheries  Policy 
emphasis  the  maximization  of  yields  through  fish  farming  and  protecting  the  fish  landing  sites 
and facilities from flooding, identified as one of the adaptation activities to address the adverse 
impacts of climate change on the sector and the national economy.  
 
In addition to the national and sectorial policies discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there are 
a  number  of  complementary  plans,  programmes  and  projects,  which  are  closely  linked  to 
development  and  implementation  of  climate  change  activities  including  this  INDC.  These 
include  the  Gambia  National  Agricultural  Investment  Plan  (GNAIP,  2011  -  2015,  Ref: 
GOTG/GNAIP,  2010),  the  West  Africa  Agricultural  Productivity  Programme  (WAAPP),  the 
Global  Agricultural  Food  Security  Programme  (GAFSP,  2012  -  2016)  and  the  United  Nations 
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF, 2012 - 2016). The GNIAP is aligned fully with 
the national goals of Vision 2020, and aims to support the realization of main national strategic 
programmes,  including  the  PAGE  (2012-2015)  and  the  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources 
(ANR) Sector Policy (2010). 
 
Other  strategies  and  programmes  specific  to  climate  change  include  the  NAPA  (GOTG/NCC, 
2007) the Climate Change Priority Action Plan of the PAGE (GOTG/PAGE, 2011), the National 
NAMA (2011) which includes the proposed development of a Low Emissions Climate Resilient 
Development Strategy (LECRDS), the Agriculture NAMA (2013) and the Energy NAMA. 
 
Climate change must be integrated into these policies, strategies, plans and programmes for the 
effective  and  sustainable  implementation  of  the  climate  change  convention  and  any  future 
regimes. This will serve to mainstream climate change into the development frameworks of The 
Gambia. 

 
7: FOLLOW UP 
The  Government  and  people  of  the  Republic  of  The  Gambia  request  that  this  submission  is 
published on the UNFCCC webpage and that this INDC is included in the synthesis report to be 
prepared  by  the  Secretariat.  The  Gambia  and  its  collaborators  are  willing  and  available  to 
provide  further  information  to  enhance  clarity.  It  is  our  ardent  belief  that  other  countries  with 
similar  and  more  advance  national  circumstances  of  The  Gambia  can  and  should  submit  their 
INDC well before Paris.
