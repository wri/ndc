Intended Nationally Determined Contribution  

of Viet Nam  

 

I. Introduction  

 
Viet Nam is willing to respond to climate change, which is demonstrated by the range 
of  national  policies  and  concrete  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  mitigation  and  climate  change 
adaptation measures that have been undertaken throughout the past decade, funded primarily 
by domestic financial resources. Additionally, Viet Nam supports achieving a legal agreement 
with the participation of all Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change  (UNFCCC)  in  order  to  keep  the  global  average  atmospheric  temperature  increase, 
since pre-industrial times, at below 2oC. 

 
Viet  Nam  signed  the  UNFCCC  in  1992  and  ratified  it  in  1994;  signed  the  Kyoto 
Protocol  (KP)  in  1998  and  ratified  it  in  2002;  set  up  a  National  Steering  Committee  to 
implement  the  UNFCCC  and  KP;  submitted  to  the  UNFCCC  Secretariat  its  Initial  National 
Communication (2003), the Second National Communication (2010), and the Initial Biennial 
Update  Report  (2014),  reflecting  the  latest  climate  change  response  efforts  and  GHG 
inventories. 

 
In  2008,  the  Government  issued  the  National  Target  Programme  to  Respond  to 
Climate  Change  (NTP-RCC)  in  order  to  assess  climate  change  impacts  and  develop 
adaptation  and  mitigation  measures.  Climate  change  was  mainstreamed  into  the  National 
Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan 
(2011-2015),  and  policies  on  disaster  risk  reduction,  coastal  zone  management,  and  energy 
supply and use. Economic sectors and provinces have developed  Action Plans to respond to 
climate change.  

 
In 2011, the National Climate Change Strategy was issued, outlining the objectives for 
2011-2015  and  2016-2050,  and  priority  projects  to  be  implemented  in  the  period  of  2011-
2015.  The  strategy  identifies  climate  change  responses  that  are  vital  for  the  development  of 
the country. Responding to climate change must be associated with sustainable development 
and  a  transition  towards  a  low-carbon  economy,  take  advantage  of  opportunities  to  increase 
competitiveness and strengthen the national position, and carry out adaptation and mitigation 
efforts in parallel. 

 
In 2012, the National Green Growth Strategy was approved, which includes mitigation 
targets and measures; and regulations on linking with international carbon markets. In 2013, 
the  Law on Natural  Disaster Prevention and Control was enacted, aiming  to  address  diverse 
natural hazards that affect the country, which are primarily climate change related. The 2014 
Law  on  Environment  includes  a  full  chapter  on  climate  change.  The  development  and 
implementation  the  above-mentioned  policies  and  activities  to  respond  to  climate  change 
relies mainly on domestic human and financial resources.  

Viet Nam's INDC includes a mitigation and an adaptation component. The mitigation 
 

 

component  includes  both  unconditional  and  conditional  contributions.  The  unconditional 
contributions  are  measures  that  will  be  implemented  using  domestic  resources,  while  the 
conditional  contributions  are  measures  that  could  be  implemented  if  new  and  additional 
international financial support, technology transfer and capacity building are received.  

Viet  Nam's  INDC  identifies  the  GHG  reduction  pathway  in  the  2021-2030  period. 
 
With  domestic  resources  GHG  emissions  will  be  reduced  by  8%  by  2030  compared  to  the 
Business as Usual scenario (BAU). The above-mentioned contribution could be increased up 
to 25% with international support.   

 
The  adaptation  component  describes  the  climate  change  adaptation  actions  that  are 
currently  being  implemented.  It  also  identifies  adaptation  gaps  in  terms  of  institutional  and 
policy  arrangements,  financing,  human  resource  capacity  and  technology  and  prioritized 
adaptation measures for the 2021-2030 period. It is estimated that the national budget will be 
able to meet approximately one third of the financial needs to implement adaptation measures 
in  this  period,  and  will  seek  international  support  and  private  sector  investment  for  the 
remainder. 

 
Viet  Nam's  INDC  has  been  developed  with  the  participation  and  contributions  from 
different  line  ministries,  non-governmental  organisations,  research  institutions,  business 
sector representatives as well as international development partners. 

 
Through this INDC, Viet Nam reaffirms its willingness to respond to climate change 
and contribute to the objective of the UNFCCC. Viet Nam believes its contribution is fair and 
ambitious,  feasible  and  achievable.  It  is  committed  to  continuing  to  address  climate  change 
based on domestic resources and international support.  

II. GHG Mitigation Component 

2.1. GHG mitigation activities prior to 2020 

Viet  Nam  is  one  of  the  first  countries  to  ratify  the  UNFCCC  and  the  KP  and  has 

actively been researching and implementing GHG mitigation measures. 

As of June 2015, Viet Nam had 254 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects 
accredited  and  registered  by  the  CDM  Executive  Board  (EB).  Viet  Nam  is  ranked  number 
four  internationally  for  number  of  projects,  with  a  total  GHG  reduction  amount  of 
approximately  137.4  million  tCO2e  in  the  credit  period.  Among  the  254  projects,  energy 
projects  account  for  87.6%,  waste  treatment  for  10.2%,    reforestation  and  afforestation  for 
0.4%  and  other  projects  for  1.8%.  To  date,  more  than  12  million  Certified  Emission 
Reductions  (CERs)  credits  have  been  issued  by  the  EB  for  Viet  Nam,  which  is  ranked 
eleventh in the world.  

The  Government  has  issued  many  policies  on  energy  saving  and  efficiency,  such  as 
the "National Target Programme on Energy Efficiency" (2006), the Law on "Economical and 
Efficient use of Energy" (2010). The Government has prioritized policies, such as renewable 
energy development, consistent with Viet Nam's mitigation potential and conditions, in order 
to  contribute  to  energy  security  and  environmental  protection.  Policies  encouraging  energy 
savings and efficiencies in production and daily life, through the application of energy saving 
and renewable energy technologies, are also a priority. 

Viet  Nam  has  made  significant  efforts  in  forest  protection,  afforestation  and 
reforestation,  and  is  one  of  the  countries  participating  in  Reducing  Emissions  from 
Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation,  sustainable  management  of  forests,  conservation  of 
forest  carbon  stocks  and  enhancement  of  forest  carbon  stocks  and  enhancement  of  forest 
carbon stocks (REDD+). 

 
Viet  Nam  is  developing  and  preparing  for  the  implementation  of  Nationally 
Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), as well as the registration and implementation of 
carbon  credit  projects  according  to  the  Verified  Carbon  Standard  (VCS)  and  the  Gold 
Standard (GS). 

Although  Viet  Nam  has  exerted  great  efforts  in  implementing  mitigation  actions,  it 

still faces a variety of difficulties and challenges regarding the following issues: 

-  Establishment of a national GHG inventory system, and Measurement, Reporting and 

Verification (MRV) system at all levels; 

-  NAMA development and implementation; 

-  Application of technologies to reduce GHGs, especially in the agriculture sector; 

-  Access to national and foreign finance for mitigation activities.

*  N2O = 298 

Viet Nam's BAU scenario for GHG emissions was developed based 
on  the  assumption  of  economic  growth  in  the  absence  of  climate 
change  policies.  The  BAU  starts  from  2010  (the  latest  year  of  the 
national GHG inventory) and includes the energy, agriculture, waste 
and LULUCF sectors. 

*  GHG emissions in 2010: 246.8 million tCO2e 

*  Projections  for  2020  and  2030  (not  included  industrial 

processes): 

-  2020: 474.1 million tCO2e  
-  2030: 787.4 million tCO2e 

With  domestic  resources,  by  2030  Viet  Nam  will  reduce  GHG 
emissions by 8% compared to BAU, in which:  
-  Emission  intensity  per  unit  of  GDP  will  be  reduced  by  20% 

compared to the 2010 levels; 

-  Forest cover will increase to the level of 45%.  
The  above-mentioned 8% contribution could be  increased  to  2 5 %  if 
international  support  is  received  through  bilateral  and  multilateral 
cooperation,  as  well  as 
implementation  of  new 
mechanisms under the Global Climate Agreement, in which emission 
intensity per unit of GDP  will be reduced by 30% compared to 2010 
levels.

2.3. Fair and Ambitious 

Given  the  socio-economic  conditions  of  a  developing  country  that  is  highly  affected 
by  climate  change,  Viet  Nam's  INDC  represents  its  efforts  to  contribute  to  global  climate 
change  mitigation  to  reach  the  ultimate  objective  of  the  UNFCCC,  as  well  as  the  target  of 
maintaining the global average atmospheric temperature rise  to below 2○C by the end of the 
21st century. 

In  2010,  GHG  emissions  of  Viet  Nam  accounted  only  for  approximately    0.5%  of 
global  GHG  emissions  and  GHG  emissions  per  capita  were  relatively  low  at  2.84  tonnes  of 
CO2e.  However,  Viet  Nam  is  proactively  implementing  climate  change  response  activities, 
developing  a  low-carbon  and  green  economy,  strengthening  the  implementation  of  potential 
GHG mitigation measures in the energy, industry, transport, agriculture and waste sectors and 
enhancing carbon sinks in the LULUCF sector. 

National  efforts  are  also  reflected  in  the  fact  that  the  Government  considers  climate 
change  response  a crucial issue, as it  is  the entire country's  responsibility  to  simultaneously 
implement adaptation and mitigation, as well as use natural resources effectively. A roadmap 
with  methods to  implement  GHG mitigation  measures  to  achieve Viet  Nam's  INDC  will be 
issued. 

 
2.4.  Policy  framework  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  goal  to  mitigate  GHG 
emissions  

Legal documents and policies on climate change support to INDC implementation in Viet 

Nam include: 

-  Law on Environment (6/2014); 

-  Law on Economical and Efficient use of Energy (6/2010); 

-  Resolution  No.  24-NQ/TW  on  "Pro-actively  responding  to  climate  change,  enhancing 

natural resource management and environmental protection" (6/2013); 

-  National Climate Change Strategy (12/2011); 

-  National Green Growth Strategy (9/2012); 

-  Decision  1775/QĐ-TTg  on  "Management  of  GHG  emissions;  management  of  carbon 

credit trading activities to the world market" (11/2012). 

Viet  Nam  will  continue  to  develop  policies  that  create  favourable  conditions  for 

investments in mitigation activities. 

2.5. Measures to achieve the GHG emissions mitigation targets of the INDC 

In order to achieve the above-mentioned mitigation targets, Viet Nam will exert efforts 

in implementing the following measures:

building and technology in the implementation of climate change strategies and policies; 

-  Facilitate  international  cooperation  to  implement  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  on 

climate change related projects. 

2.6. Monitoring and evaluation 

The  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  implementation  of  the  GHG  mitigation 
component to  achieve the  mitigation goals  formulated in the  INDC  will be reflected  in  Viet 
Nam's  "National  Communications"  and  "Biennial  Updated  Reports"  submitted  to  the 
UNFCCC. 

III. Adaptation Component 

3.1. Climate change impacts  

Viet  Nam  is  one  of  the  countries  severely  affected  by  climate  change  and  its  related 
disasters. The Mekong Delta is one of the deltas in the world most susceptible and vulnerable 
to  sea  level  rise.  Climate  change  adaptation  is  vital  for  Viet  Nam  and  is  regarded  by  the 
Government as one of the priority tasks to reduce the vulnerability level. 

Over  the  past  50  years,  the  average  temperature  in  Viet  Nam  has  increased  by 
approximately 0.5°C and the sea level has risen by about 20cm. Extreme climate events have 
increased  both  in  frequency  and  intensity.  Climate  change  has  made  hazards,  especially 
storms, floods and droughts, more intense. 

According to Viet Nam's climate change scenario (2012), by 2100 the annual average 
temperature in Viet Nam is expected to increase by 2 to 3oC, precipitation will increase in the 
rainy season and decrease  in the dry season and the sea level will rise between 78 and 100cm. 

The  most  vulnerable  areas,  regions  and  objects  are:  agriculture,  natural  ecosystems, 
biodiversity,  water  resources,  public  health  and  infrastructure;  the  Mekong  Delta,  the  Red 

 
River Delta, the Central Coast; the poor, ethnic minorities, the elderly, women, children and 
people with disabilities. 

 
Viet Nam is facing losses and damages, which are beyond its resilience and capacity, 
even  after  thorough  application  of  climate  change  adaptation  measures  and  mitigation  of 
GHG emissions. Sharing and managing risks of loss and damage must be considered at both 
the national and international levels. 

 
Over the past 30 years, the average number of dead and missing people due to natural 
disasters totalled 500 annually; thousands of people were injured and annual economic losses 
accounted for approximately 1.5% of GDP.  

 
Without  implementing  climate  change  adaptation  measures,  when  the  sea  level  rises 
by 100cm, over 10% of the Red River Delta and Quang Ninh province, more than 2.5% of the 
area  of  the  central  coastal  provinces,  and  over  20%  of  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  will  be  at  risk  of 
being  inundated,  directly  affecting  9%  of  the  population  of  the  Red  River  Delta  and  Quang 
Ninh  province,  nearly  9%  of  the  population  of  the  central  coastal  provinces  and 
approximately  7%  of  the  population  of  Ho  Chi Minh  City;  up  to  39%  of  the  Mekong  Delta 
could be submerged, affecting 35% of the population and causing the risk of losing 40.5% of 
the total rice production in this region. 

Adaptation measures to prevent future losses are technically possible, however, many 
 
measures to protect against river floods, storm surges, saline water intrusion and drought, are 
needed  to  be  implemented  in  the  21st  century,  which  exceed  the  nation's  capacity.  The 
increasing  impact  of  climate  change  on  residential  areas,  economic  zones,  and  ecosystems 
will lead to unavoidable losses. 

3.2. The need to include an adaptation component in Viet Nam's INDC 

The  INDC  is  an  official  and  important  channel  for  conveying  information  and 
experience  in  adaptation,  including  sharing  risks  and  damages,  to  the  international 
community.  The  National  Climate  Change  Strategy  has  identified  that  priorities  are  food 
security,  energy  security,  water  security,  poverty  reduction,  gender  equality,  social  security, 
public  health,  livelihood  improvements  and  the  protection  of  natural  resources.  These  goals 
can only be achieved through enhancing the adaptive capacity of human and socio-economic 
systems as well as natural systems. Through its INDC, Viet Nam can communicate its current 
and future climate change response efforts implemented with national resources, and what can 
be done better with additional international support. 

Climate change adaptation will reduce vulnerability and inequality within and among 
countries. Adaptation benefits go beyond the scope of each locality, community and country. 
Pro-active  climate  change  adaptation  is  a  contribution  of  Viet  Nam  to  the  global  efforts  to 
address  climate  change.  Adaptation  to  climate  change  will  help  Viet  Nam  increase  its 
resilience to climate change and can sometimes also contribute to GHG emissions mitigation. 

The adaptation component of the INDC includes plans developed in accordance with 
the  current  situation  and  projections  until  2030  and  may  be  subject  to  adjustments  or 
supplementations to suit the specific conditions of each period. The implementation of these 
plans depends on national resources and particularly on international support. 

3.3. Climate change adaptation until 2020 

Climate  change  adaptation  until  2020  is  reflected  in  the  following  strategies, 

programmes and action plans: 

-  Resolution  No.  24-NQ/TW  on  "Pro-actively  responding  to  climate  change, 

enhancing natural resource management and environmental protection" (2013); 

 
- Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (2013); 

- National Climate Change Strategy (2011); 

- National Target Programme to Respond to Climate Change (2008, 2012); 

- Action plans at the national, ministerial, sectoral and local levels on climate change 

response and disaster risk prevention and reduction. 

Viet  Nam  has  determined  that  climate  change  adaptation  must  be  carried  out  in  a 
focussed manner and respond to urgent, immediate impacts and long-term potential impacts. 
Climate  change  adaptation  must  be  linked  to  sustainable  development  and  the  transition 
towards  a  low-carbon  economy,  and  to  ensure  a  systematic,  joint,  interdisciplinary,  inter-
regional approach, and incorporate gender equality, hunger eradication and poverty reduction. 

Numerous  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  risk  management  activities  have 
been  carried  out  on  a  national  scale.  However,  national  investment  resources  for  climate 
change  adaptation  are  limited.  Meanwhile,  the  expenses  for  remedying  damage  caused  by 
potential  climate  hazards  are  expected  to  increase  significantly  under  the  impact  of  climate 
change, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. The cost of adaptation is estimated to exceed 3-
5%  of  GDP  by  2030.  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to  diversify  sources  of  investment  in  climate 
change adaptation from the public and private sectors, and from international support.  

Despite  great  effort  and  initiative  in  implementing  climate  change  adaptation 
activities, the shortage of capacities and resources for climate change adaptation measures are 
major challenges for Viet Nam. 

Policies  and  institutions:  The  legal  framework  for  integrating  climate  change  issues 
into  national  Socio-Economic  Development  Plans  is  still  limited;  there  is  still  ineffective 
coordination between line ministries, sectors and localities to address multi-sectoral and inter-
regional issues; a lack of incentives to attract domestic and foreign investment and to mobilise 
the private sector to participate in climate change adaptation. 

Capacity:  There  is  a  shortage  of  experts  and  technical  staff  who  are  specialised  in 
climate change and the assessment of the effectiveness of adaptation measures, particularly at 
the  local  level;  there  are  significant  limitations  in  communication  and  awareness-raising  on 
climate  change;  there  are  unmet  needs  in  terms  of  forecasting  disasters  and  early  warning 
capacities,  as  well  as  scientific  research  on  climate  change  and  adaptation  technology; 
appropriate climate change adaptation models at the community level need to be summarised 
comprehensively  and  replicated;  there  are  limited  capacities  to  select  and  decide  on 
prioritising resources for the implementation of climate change adaptation activities. 

Finance:  While  there  are  policies,  plans  and  programmes  climate  change  adaptation 
efforts  were  designed  to  collect  funding  for  implementation,  State  resources  can  only  meet 
30% of the adaptation needs.  

Technology:  there  is  a  shortage  of  advanced  technologies  for  hydrological  and 
meteorological  monitoring  and  forecasting,  early  warning  of  natural  disasters  and  hazards, 
and climate change adaptation. 

3.4. Climate change adaptation in the period 2021 - 2030  

Viet Nam  aims to  minimize the loss of life and property due to  climate change. The 

climate change adaptation priority actions for the period 2021-2030 include: 

1) Respond pro-actively to disasters and improve climate monitoring 

-  Modernise  the  hydro-meteorological  observatory  and  forecasting  system  to  ensure  the 
timely  forecasting  and  early  warning  of  weather  events.  Develop  the  assessment  and 

 
monitoring system on climate change and sea level rise; 

-  Produce  Socio-Economic  Development  Plans  based  on  climate  change  scenarios,  with  a 

focus on key sectors and regions; 

- 

Implement  disaster  prevention  plans  and  measures,  protect  peoples'  lives,  and  ensure 
national defence and security; 

-  Consolidate and develop prioritised and urgent disaster prevention projects; strengthen the 

capacity of search and rescue forces; 

-  Develop  infrastructure  and  make  plans  for  residential  areas;  relocate  and  resettle 
households  and  communities  from  areas  affected  frequently  by,  storm  surges,  floods, 
riverbank and shoreline erosion, or areas at risk of flash floods and landslides; 

-  Allocate  and  mobilise  resources  for  community-based  climate  change  adaptation  and 
disaster management; raise awareness and build capacities for climate change adaptation 
and disaster risk management. 

2) Ensure social security 

-  Review,  adjust  and  develop  livelihoods  and  production  processes  that  are  appropriate 

under climate change conditions and are linked to poverty reduction and social justice; 

-  Develop  mechanisms,  policies,  and  strengthen  the  insurance  system,  and  share  climate 

and disaster risks; 

- 

- 

- 

- 

Improve  regulations  and  technical  standards  for  infrastructure,  public  facilities  and 
housing, that are appropriate under climate change conditions; 

Implement  ecosystem-based  adaptation  through  the  development  of  ecosystem  services 
and  biodiversity  conservation,  with  a  focus  on  the  preservation  of  genetic  resources, 
species at risk of extinction, and important ecosystems; 

Implement  community-based  adaptation, 
prioritizing the most vulnerable communities; 

including  using 

indigenous  knowledge, 

Implement  integrated  water  resources  management  in  river  basin  systems;  ensure 
reservoir  safety;  strengthen  international  cooperation  in  addressing  transboundary  water 
issues; ensure water security; 

-  Ensure  food  security 

through  protecting,  sustainably  maintaining  and  managing 
agricultural land; restructuring of crops and livestock; create new climate change resilient 
varieties; complete the disease control and prevention system; 

- 

Implement  sustainable  forest  management;  improve  the  quality  of  poor  natural  forests; 
implement afforestation and reforestation measures, focusing on large timber plantations; 
prevent forest deforestation and degradation; 

-  Protect, restore, plant and improve the quality of coastal forests, including mangroves, 

especially in coastal estuaries and the Mekong and Red River deltas. 

3) Responding to sea level rise and urban inundation 

- 

Implement integrated coastal zone management;  

-  Use  sea  level  rise  scenarios  in  urban  and  land  use  planning  for  infrastructure,  industrial 

parks, coastal and island resettlement areas; 

Implement  anti-inundation  measures  for  large  coastal  cities;  construct  climate  change 
resilient  urban 
large  urban  drainage 
infrastructure; 

infrastructure;  strengthen  and  build  new 
- 

 

-  Consolidate, upgrade and complete crucial sea and river dykes; 

-  Control saline water intrusion in the most severely affected areas. 

3.5.  The  need  for  capacity  building,  technology  transfer  and  finance  for  climate 
change adaptation 

 
Viet  Nam  has  attempted  to  implement  climate  change  adaptation  measures  but  does 
not  have  sufficient  capacities  to  meet  the  demands,  so  there  is  a  need  for  international 
assistance as well as cooperation with other developing countries: 

-  Strengthen the capacity to adapt to climate change at national and local level. 

-  Technology transfer:  (i)  technology  for  real-time forecasting, early warning,  and  sharing 
information  system  on  real-time  hydro-meteorological  monitoring;  (ii)  tools  to  assess 
climate change impacts, vulnerability, exposure and climate change adaptation measures; 
(iii) technology for the sustainable use of water resources, prevention of water pollution, 
and urban water supply;  (iv) technology to  prevent  erosion and protect  the coastline and 
riverbanks;  and  (v)  technology  for  sustainable  agriculture,  forestry  and  aquaculture 
production;  biotechnology  to  develop  new  varieties  that  are  more  resilient  to  climate 
change. 

-  Finance for climate  change  adaptation, mainly  for maintenance of existing infrastructure 
and  building  important  projects  aimed  at  prevention  of  natural  disasters,  and  social-
economic development in the context of climate change. Viet Nam encourages and creates 
favourable conditions for private sector investment in climate change adaptation activities. 

3.6. Monitoring and evaluation  

Climate  change  adaptation  activities  until  2030  will  be  evaluated  based  on  the 

 
following key indicators: 

-  At  least  90%  of  Socio-Economic  Development  Plans  have  integrated  disaster  risk 

management and climate change adaptation; 

-  The average national poverty rate is lowered 2%/year; in poor districts and communes it is 

lowered by 4%/year; 

-  100% of piers and boat storm shelters are constructed, and 100% of offshore fishing boats 

and ships have sufficient communication equipment; 

-  Forest coverage increases to 45%; the area of protection forest in coastal areas is increased 

to 380,000 hectares, including 20,000 to 50,000ha of additional mangrove planting; 

-  At  least  90%  of  city-dwellers  and  80%  of  rural  inhabitants  have  access  to  clean  water; 

100% of the population has access to health care services. 

 
The  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  implementation  of  the  adaptation  component 
will be reflected in Viet Nam's "National Communications" and "Biennial Updated Reports" 
submitted to the UNFCCC.
