<p><strong>NEW ZEALAND</strong></p>
<p><strong>Submission under the Paris Agreement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Communication and update of New Zealand’s Nationally Determined Contribution</strong></p>
<p><strong>22 April 2020</strong></p>
<p>This submission is in response to paragraphs 24 and 25 of decision 1/CP.21 and in particular meets New Zealand’s commitment to communicate or update its nationally determined contribution (NDC) by 2020.</p>
<p>New Zealand formally communicated its first NDC under the Paris Agreement upon ratification of the Paris Agreement on 5 October 2016.</p>
<p>New Zealand remains fully committed to ambitious national and global climate action to achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement, to supporting efforts aimed at limiting warming to no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and to building resilience to the impacts of climate change with a focus on our Pacific neighbours.</p>
<p>New Zealand confirmed its commitment to ambitious national action through legislation enacted in late 2019<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>set a new domestic target to
<ul>
<li><p>reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases (other than biogenic methane) to zero by 2050, and</p></li>

<li><p>to reduce emissions of biogenic methane to 24 to 47 per cent below 2017 levels by 2050, including to 10 per cent below 2017 levels by 2030</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>established a framework for a series of emissions budgets to act as stepping stones towards the long-term target, and plans and policies to achieve them</p></li>
<li><p>established regular measures to plan for the impacts of climate change in a coordinated way, including a national climate change risk assessment and a national adaptation plan</p></li>
<li><p>established a new, independent Climate Change Commission in December 2019 to provide expert advice and monitoring, with the goal of helping keep successive governments on track to meeting long-term goals.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The objective in establishing the Climate Change Commission is to avail the Government of
the best available expert advice on New Zealand’s climate change settings. Under the
legislation described above the Minister for Climate Change has requested the Climate
Change Commission to provide advice and recommendations to the Government on whether
the NDC should change to make it consistent with the global 1.5°C temperature goal and, if
so, how. The Climate Change Commission will be providing its advice in early 2021.</p>
