  <h2>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
  <p>Mombyky | Executive Summary</p>
  <p>The Republic of Paraguay has submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Nationally Determined Contribution Intent (INDC) in 2015, which became the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC for its acronym in English) in 2016, from the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, ratified by the country, through Law No. 5681/16.</p>
  <p>This exercise to Update the NDC and the instruments generated within the framework of the same to 2021, were established based on the guidelines of the National Development Plan Paraguay 2030 (PND Paraguay 2030), the National Policy on Climate Change and other sectoral, national and international policies, considered as pillars of the commitments assumed by the country.</p>
  <p>In addition, the update includes the identification of transversal axes for the generation of the instruments, covering the management of climate risks, regulatory aspects, the gender perspective, attention to indigenous peoples, climate empowerment and the promotion of the Goals. Sustainable Development (SDG) by 2030.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, considering the national circumstances, and the concepts of equity and climate justice, as well as the sovereign right of sustainable development of the countries, this NDC reaffirms that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Given the negligible historical contribution of the Republic of Paraguay to global GHG emissions (≤0.01%) (Ritchie and Roser, 2020), despite its high vulnerability to climate change, exacerbated by its status as a landlocked country (SEAM / UNDP / GEF, 2017), adaptation is seen as a priority national approach. Thus, according to findings reported in the scientific study "State of the Climate in Paraguay" (Grassi, 2020), the year 2019 was the hottest in national history, with +1.5 and +1.7 ° C with respect to temperature 1961-1990 and pre-industrial era mean, respectively. For its part, the average annual precipitation has increased by 200 mm during the last 70 years.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Given the country's contribution to the achievement of global objectives such as food security, in accordance with the vision of the PND Paraguay 2030, it is envisioned as a global platform for food production in the context of its sustainable development.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Flaunting its mitigation efforts through good practices and plausible technological innovations, the country assumed since 2015 and reaffirms in this update, the commitment to reduce projected emissions by 20% in the BAU (Business as usual) scenario by 2030 , 10% corresponding to a fraction conditioned to the international provision of the means of implementation and the other 10% to an unconditional fraction, based on the use of its own resources.</p>
  <p>In compliance with the five-year update, called for by Art. 4.9 of the Paris Agreement, this exercise to update the NDC to 2021 is based on multisectoral participatory processes, for the construction of the 2 Components: Adaptation and Mitigation to Change Climate.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that according to Art. 5 of the Paris Agreement, in this update of the NDC, through the so-called “Nature-based Solutions” (NBS), the preponderant role of ecosystems and their environmental services is recognized , mainly that of forests, grasslands, wetlands and aquifers, for adaptation and mitigation to climate change, by contributing to food security, disaster risk reduction, carbon sequestration and the resilience of countries with abundant natural capital, such as the Republic of Paraguay.</p>
  <h4>FIRST COMMUNICATION OF ADAPTATION</h4>
  <p>By virtue of Art. 7 of the Paris Agreement, the First Adaptation Communication is reported, at the time of establishing a total of 25 objectives, with their lines of action, gaps and needs by 2030, in 7 prioritized sectors.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Resilient Communities and Cities,</strong> with 5 objectives aimed at citizen participation and municipal management, resilient infrastructures and green areas in cities, as well as promoting sustainable tourism and the natural and cultural heritage of Protected Wild Areas (ASP).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Health and Epidemiology,</strong> with 4 objectives aimed at strengthening health systems in the face of health emergencies, derived from meteorological phenomena, extreme weather events and emerging diseases.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Ecosystems and Biodiversity,</strong> with 2 objectives aimed at the sustainable management of ecosystems and Protected Wild Areas (ASP), for the provision of ecosystem services and the protection of biodiversity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Energy,</strong> with 3 objectives aimed at improving the distribution capacity of electricity services in vulnerable communities, as well as promoting actions for the conservation and restoration of water basins in recharge areas for the generation of hydroelectric energy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Agricultural, Forestry and Food Security Production,</strong> with 5 objectives aimed at promoting adaptive capacity through good agroforestry practices, technified production, improved crops, to promote global food security, access to markets by farmers. family farmers and indigenous peoples, as well as access to agro-meteorological information for timely decision-making.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Water Resources,</strong> with 4 objectives aimed at the management and access to safe water in the face of the threat of scarcity, as well as the protection and restoration of wetlands and springs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Transport,</strong> with 2 objectives aimed at the sustainable management of cross-border rivers and the development of alternatives for the transport of passengers and goods at a national and international level.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>MITIGATION IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h4>
  <p>By virtue of Art. 4.2 of the Paris Agreement, the emissions baseline has been updated to 2030 and Climate Change Mitigation Plans (PMCC) have been drawn up in 5 sectors:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Agriculture,</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF),</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Use of Industrial Products and Processes (IPPU),</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Waste</strong> and,</li>
    <li><strong>Energy,</strong> encompassing the total prioritization of 45 measures: approved, applied and planned, with which the mitigation scenarios were projected: "with measures" and "additional measures" by 2030.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The mitigation scenarios presented in this document show that most of them are already being implemented at the national level (e.g. direct seeding of technified crops, the circular economy on an industrial scale, the promotion of a greater use of renewable energies, etc.), generating encouraging reductions in the different sectors, for the fulfillment of the established goals.</p>
  <p>In addition, this document includes <strong>information to facilitate the Clarity, Transparency and Understanding of the NDC (ITCU</strong> ), based on: 1. Quantifiable information about the benchmark, 2. Period of application, 3. Scope and coverage, 4. Planning processes, 5. Assumptions and methodological approaches used to quantify anthropogenic GHG emissions / removals, 6. How the country considers its NDC to be fair and ambitious in light of its national circumstances, and 7. How the NDC contributes to the achievement of the objective of the UNFCCC.</p>
  <h4>MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY</h4>
  <p>This document includes information on the means of implementation, covering 3 elements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Building and strengthening capacities,</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Climate finance,</strong></li>
    <li><strong>The development and transfer of technologies;</strong> in addition to <strong>information on continuous improvement and transparency,</strong> with which the country identifies the challenges it faces when addressing the implementation and monitoring of the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Components.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>PARTICIPATORY PROCESS AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS</h4>
  <p>The entire process of updating the NDC, extended between 2020 and 2021, was built with various challenges due to the SARS-COVID19 pandemic, which generated the need to make methodological adjustments in the construction and validation stages of the different processes. For the preparation of this document, using virtual media and platforms as spaces for the development of participatory consultation and deliberation activities in most cases.</p>
  <p>Through the participatory process, the Republic of Paraguay has managed to identify the necessary institutional arrangements, having to consolidate them a posteriori for the fulfillment of the climatic commitments assumed, with a view to the sustainable development of the country.</p>

  <h2>2. INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>As of the ratification of the Paris Agreement, by the Republic of Paraguay in 2016, the generation of various public policy instruments began, including Strategies and Plans for Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change. Also, since then, actions have been taken to identify potential sources or entities that provide the means of implementation for the NDC.</p>
  <p>Consecutively, between 2020 and 2021, in the health and socio-economic context generated by the SARS-COVID19 pandemic, the process of updating the NDC of the Republic of Paraguay to 2030 began, mainly covering the following sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Cross-cutting axes and actions, which include approaches and relevant social segments, in the process of participatory construction of climate commitments.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The First Adaptation Communication, which represents an important advance in the identification of ambitious objectives for the adaptation of 7 sectors considered a priority at the national level, due to their impact on the socio-cultural, economic and environmental development of the country. On the other hand, for these priority sectors, 25 objectives are established by 2030, with their respective lines of action, gaps and needs, which aim to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to the negative impacts of climate change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Information for Transparency, Update of the BAU (Business As Usual) Scenario, Sector Plans and Climate Change Mitigation Scenarios to 2030.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Means of implementation, which include: the need to build and strengthen capacities, climate finance, development and transfer of technologies, as resources or conditioning factors for the achievement of the objectives and proposed goals.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Aspects for continuous improvement, with respect to the national commitments outlined in 2015 and those to be reported next. The context in which this update is developed conditions some substantial differences in relation to the INDC of 2015, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Review of the priority sectors and objectives of the Adaptation Component, which is reaffirmed as the national priority approach, given the country's high vulnerability to climate change as established in the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (SEAM / UNDP / GEF, 2017), despite the fact that national contributions to global emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) are negligible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Relevance to elucidate that although in the First NDC, adaptation has been affirmed as the priority national approach, in this update plans with specific sectoral mitigation measures are proposed, since all the countries ratifying the Paris Agreement, taking into account Considering their national circumstances, they should consider adaptation and mitigation of climate change, as complementary but not subordinate components. Therefore, the Sectoral Plans for Climate Change Mitigation (PMCC) constitute “tangible” proposals within the scope of mitigation expressed in 2015, which extends to the sectors mentioned in the methodological guides of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change ( IPCC) to carry out the National Inventories of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI).</p>
          <p>In addition, it should be considered that the methodological approach carried out obeys the different required monitoring processes: Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) for Adaptation and Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) for Mitigation. However, this should not be interpreted as a contradiction to Art. 7 of the Paris Agreement, since unfailingly many of the measures identified present co-benefits for both approaches, in the context of the country's sustainable development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the part of the Mitigation Component, although an increase in the goal is not explicitly proposed in relation to the 20% committed in 2015, the adjustment of the baseline implies a lower projection of GHG emissions by 2030, taking into account the lower projected economic expansion (expected growth, according to the historical average GDP growth ≤3.17% during the last decade, instead of the 6.60% considered in 2015 according to the Paraguay 2030 PND). This implies that, although a more ambitious mitigation goal is not proposed per se than that of 2015, the unconditional proportion of 10% contemplates a greater conjunctural challenge for the country in terms of:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use of the public budget and management of international resources for climate action.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Need for economic reactivation and promotion of green recovery options in the face of the impacts of the SARS-COVID19 pandemic, in the context of sustainable development.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, it should be noted that the advances envisioned by the Republic of Paraguay, such as the updating of the base data and the estimation of the potential impact of good practices and technological innovations by 2030, through the consolidation of the institutional work team, technical bases, subsequently requiring strategic alliances and joint efforts by all national sectors, in order to implement the NDC and fulfill the objectives of the Paris Agreement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Limit to the year 2100, the increase in the global average temperature below 2 ° C, and if possible 1.5 ° C, with respect to pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would considerably reduce the adverse effects of the climate change;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Increase the capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, promoting climate resilience and development with low GHG emissions, in a way that does not compromise food production and,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Bring financial flows to a level compatible with the climate-resilient and low-GHG development trajectory.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3. NDC UPDATE PROCESS</h2>
  <p>NDC ñembopy´ahu reheguáva NDC update process</p>
  <h3>3.1 AXES AND TRANSVERSAL ACTIONS</h3>
  <p>The update of the NDC has incorporated 6 transversal axes to its components, which were identified during its construction, in order to point to an inclusive approach in prioritizing the objectives, lines of action, needs and gaps of the adaptation sectors, as well as in the prioritization of the measures of the sectoral mitigation plans. These include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Climate risk management.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The normative aspects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The gender perspective.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Attention to indigenous peoples.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Citizen climate empowerment, and especially by future generations: children and youth.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Technology and research.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>In relation to the process of updating the NDC, it was enunciated under the principle of continuous improvement, for which, through the National Directorate of Climate Change (DNCC) of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MADES), permanent socializations of the progress of the process, including territorial tours and a space for public consultation, fostering civic participation in general.</p>
  <p>Given the different methodological processes developed between 2020 and 2021, for the participatory construction of the Adaptation and Mitigation Components in the update of the NDC, the approaches carried out are presented below.</p>
  <h3>3.2 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH OF THE ADAPTATION COMPONENT</h3>
  <p>The approach used to collect information for this component is based on the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC), which is structured from a sectoral and local adaptation (SEAM / UNDP / GEF, 2017). Thus, under the modality of group and individual interviews, some 149 meetings were held to collect information and share progress with different social segments.</p>
  <p>481 people were interviewed, those who participated in virtual or face-to-face activities for the collection of information and socialization of progress, between December 2020 and April 2021. Of this group, 53% of the participants were men, and 47% of the participants were women.</p>
  <p>Among the sectors interviewed, there is the public sector with 28% participation, institutions at the central level and other decentralized entities, and municipalities with 23% participation. Organized and unorganized civil society had a 23% participation. In addition, there was an 18% participation of representation from the private sector. Finally, there were present, with 8% participation, members of the academy, sector experts, and representatives of indigenous peoples (See Graph 1).</p>
  <p><img width="699" height="505" alt="image" src="img/PRY-NDC1-1.png"></p>
  <h3>3.3 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE MITIGATION COMPONENT</h3>
  <p>This was based on the mapping of the key institutional actors, for the provision of the basic data that allowed to identify the mitigation measures of the country.</p>
  <p>Considering the information and feedback flows, for the development of the mitigation component instruments, 3 instances are distinguished: 1. Technical; 2. Consultative-deliberative, made up of the members of the NDC Board and the National Climate Change Commission (CNCC), as well as experts, territorial actors and participants in the public consultation, and 3. Political-institutional, made up of the DNCC, which chairs the NDC Table and the CNCC, reporting the NDC together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE) of Paraguay, as the respective focal points, holder and alternate before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC). In turn, there was the participation of the sectors that are visualized below in Graph 2.</p>
  <p><img width="699" height="653" alt="image" src="img/PRY-NDC1-2.png"></p>
  <p>Finally, for both the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Component, Table 1 shows other disaggregated indicators of interest, in relation to the level of participation of 2 cross-cutting sectors, observing relatively similar values for both components.</p>

  <h2>4. Update 2021 of the NDC of the Republic of Paraguay to 2030</h2>
  <p>Marandu Tekohañemohenda Rehegua First Adaptation Communication</p>
  <h3>4.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT</h3>
  <p>In the First NDC, in force since 2016, adaptation to climate change is defined as a national priority, and 9 priority sectors are named, selected in accordance with the definitions of the National Development Plan of Paraguay 2030, due to their importance for socio-economic, environmental and cultural development. These sectors have served as the basis for the Strategy (2015) and the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (2017), developed in subsequent years.</p>
  <p>For the present update of the NDC, the priority sectors are regrouped into 7, for which the aim is to increase the capacity to adapt to the present and future impacts of climate change, based on the definition of 25 objectives by 2030, with their respective lines of action, needs and gaps. This new scope in the definition of objectives for priority adaptation sectors is developed in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement, which “urges countries to increase their ambition progressively in each presentation of the NDC , taking into account national circumstances ”.</p>
  <p>Additionally, in line with Article 7, paragraph 10, of the Paris Agreement, which “invites the parties to present and periodically update the adaptation communication, with information on priorities, support needs and actions implemented at the national level”, Paraguay presents as part of this NDC, its First Adaptation Communication. It was structured based on the content established for said document, in Decision 9 / CMA.1, developed in 2018 for the Conference of the Parties (COP).</p>
  <p>In turn, the objectives, lines of action, needs and gaps contribute to other international normative frameworks, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Convention for Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Sendai Framework. , Warsaw Mechanism for Loss and Damage, and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. It should be noted that several of the objectives were considered taking into account a gender and indigenous peoples perspective, as well as possible co-benefits for the mitigation of climate change.</p>
  <p>This document is the result of the technical review of available official information, consultation work involving governing institutions of the different public sectors, and bilateral meetings with experts, members of the CNCC and members of the "ad hoc Table". "from NDC. On the other hand, it also includes consultations with representatives of municipalities and communities established in different ecoregions of the country.</p>
  <p>As of the presentation of this NDC to the UNFCCC, Paraguay will initiate a broad dialogue, from the national level to the sub-national governments, in order to consolidate the institutional arrangements necessary for the definition of a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) system. ) focused on measuring the objectives of adaptation to climate change, and establishing a roadmap for their implementation.</p>
  <h3>4.2 NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS</h3>
  <h4>4.2.1 International Frameworks and Conventions</h4>
  <p>Paraguay, as a member country of the United Nations, in 2015 approved the 2030 agenda for the member states of the United Nations (UN) for Sustainable Development. Within the framework of this agenda, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted, which guide public development policies and serve as a guide for planning and implementing actions against climate change.</p>
  <p>In 1995, the Ramsar Convention on the Protection of Wetlands of International Importance entered into force in Paraguay, signed in 1971.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, incorporating into the commitments as a Party to the UNFCCC, Paraguay by Law No. 253/93 “Approving the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), adopted during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development - the Earth Summit -, held in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and by Law No. 970/96 “Approving the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), in countries affected by drought severe or desertification, particularly in Africa ”, these commitments are transversal and complement the management of climate change in areas that are directly affected by its impacts.</p>
  <p>Through Decree No. 5965/16 Paraguay, the objective, priorities and global goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 are adopted ”. The National Plan for the implementation of the Sendai Framework (2018-2022), constitutes the multisectoral planning tool in the short, medium and long term to achieve the goal and the seven objectives of the Sendai Framework, which allows progress towards the strengthening of resilience in Paraguay.</p>
  <h4>4.2.2. The Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage</h4>
  <p>This mechanism is established within the UNFCCC to strengthen the capacities of the Parties to face the losses and damages associated with the impacts of climate change in an integrated and coherent way, through the understanding of risks, increased dialogue and the promotion of mechanisms to facilitate technical and financial support.</p>
  <p>Along the same lines, Paraguay recognizes the need to promote its participation in the discussions and negotiations of said mechanism, in order to carry out actions that address and minimize losses and damages related to the adverse effects of climate change, including to extreme and slow-onset weather events, causing forced displacement and migration.</p>
  <h3>NATIONAL POLICY INSTRUMENTS WITH A FOCUS ON ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
  <p>The Paraguayan Government has been working on instruments and tools such as policies, national plans of action and projects, to promote the adoption of a vision of long-term sustainable development.</p>
  <p>In September 2016, the National Congress of the Republic of Paraguay sanctioned the ratification of the Paris Agreement, through Law No. 5681/16. The following year, the National Climate Change Law was enacted, promulgated by the Executive Power, through Law No. 5875/17, which aims to establish the general regulatory framework that allows planning and responding, urgently, adequately , coordinated and sustained, in the face of the impacts of climate change, in coherence with the Paris Agreement and in line with the SDGs.</p>
  <p>In 2014, the Paraguay 2030 National Development Plan was developed, which is the document that defines the strategic axes and objectives, the policy priorities and the lines of action for the inclusive and sustained development of Paraguay, including among its axes poverty reduction, social development and inclusive economic growth; on the other hand, as transversal lines, territorial ordering and development, and environmental sustainability are defined. Framed by these guidelines, MADES is responsible for providing support tools to promote adaptation mechanisms, as well as mitigation, providing planning and management instruments to governments at the national and subnational level, in order to reduce the impacts. of climate change.</p>
  <p>In 2015, the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (ENACC) was developed, which defined principles and action frameworks for increasing resilience. They were used in 2016, as the basis for the development of the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC), which identified priority sectors and established an operational structure in order to become an articulating instrument of Paraguayan public policy. in the field of adaptation.</p>
  <h3>4.3 VULNERABILITIES TO CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
  <p>The study of the "State of the Climate in Paraguay 2019" (Grassi, 2020), provides evidence that climate change is accelerating in the country, and this fact, beyond representing only an environmental problem, constitutes a threat to development sustainable country.</p>
  <p>The increase in temperature in Paraguay can be observed in different time scales, not only in the values of the annual average temperatures, as is the case of the last five-year period 2015-2019; the last decade 2010-2019 and the last 30 years from 1990-2019, which were the hottest compared to their predecessors since 1960.</p>
  <p>Average annual rainfall increased 200 mm in the last 70 years, this represents a trend of approximately 3 mm / year. The floods of the Paraguay River in Asunción were more frequent in the last 40 years (1980-2019) since 1904, in which there are records. Some cities have been experiencing floods in periods of 10 or 12 years, however, in recent years they occur more frequently. The rains and consequent floods especially affect the Eastern Region and the Chaco, and occur between the months of October to May. According to the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (2017), floods affect riverside cities such as Concepción, Asunción, Alberdi, Pilar and Encarnación. However, in recent years floods have also been observed in different areas of the Central Chaco.</p>
  <p>The number of heat waves tripled in the country in the last 40 years (1980-2019), severe droughts were more frequent in this century than in the past. The year 2019 was the hottest in the history of the country, with an average annual temperature of 24.3 ° C and +1.5 ° C above the average of the standard climatological normal temperature of 1961-1990, as well as spring this year was the hottest (26 ° C) in fifty years. Additionally, in the same year, extreme events such as agricultural droughts, floods, extreme heat waves, hydrological droughts, forest fires and severe storms have occurred, events that have had a strong impact on the economy (Grassi, 2020).</p>
  <h3>INFORMATION AND LOCAL PERSPECTIVE ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
  <p>Within the framework of the construction of the National Adaptation Communication, a vulnerability analysis process has been carried out in 27 municipalities (See Annex 2, Figure 4), based on the following criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

  <p>The information collected from local actors was obtained from semi-structured interviews where their perception of the impact of climate change at the local level was investigated, taking as axis of analysis the priority sectors established in the process of updating the NDC. This process was carried out through interviews with 34 key local actors in the 27 selected municipalities (See Annex 1.2).</p>
  <p>Of those interviewed, practically all of them identified the increase in temperature as a slow-onset phenomenon linked to climate change. Regarding the type of extreme events, the majority referred to intense and concentrated rains as relatively recent events associated with climate change. In addition, it is mentioned that the floods, which were more gradual before, are now more abrupt and require quick reactions. On the other hand, it is perceived that periods of drought are now more frequent and intense, and facilitate the spread of fires, which are equally intense and more frequent.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, a correspondence is observed between the threats, vulnerabilities and climatic risks detected in the Disaster Risk Atlas of the Republic of Paraguay (SEN, 2018) and the events perceived by local actors. It is worth mentioning the identification of intense and concentrated rains, since in many of these municipalities agricultural activities are carried out, and this type of event not only generates floods, but impacts on the soil and crops.</p>
  <p>After the interviews carried out, the need to promote discussions that allow the identification of the effects that climate change can have on the different groups that are part of society is concluded, which, together with the information generated by the institutions and academia, allow to guide the local planning process and decision-making.</p>
  <h3>4.4 OBJECTIVES, LINES OF ACTION, GAPS AND NEEDS</h3>
  <h4>4.4.1 Methodology used to establish objectives</h4>
  <p>The definition of the objectives and lines of action was based on the review and update of the existing official information, which was complemented by participatory processes with reference institutions and sector experts. Based on this, an analysis and crossover of the sectorial information and other cross-cutting issues (donor, geographic scope, start and end date, executing institution, benefiting sectors, etc.) was carried out, and a database of data with the initiatives consulted, which are currently being carried out in the country.</p>
  <p>From the aforementioned process, a total of 25 objectives are obtained that address the different territorial, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities and opportunities in the face of climate change for the 7 priority sectors, distributed in Resilient Communities and Cities (5), Health and epidemiology (4) , Ecosystems and Biodiversity (2), Energy (3), Agricultural Production, Forestry and Food Security (5), Water Resources (4) and Transportation (2).</p>
  <p>In turn, these sectoral objectives integrate in a transversal way the gender perspective, indigenous peoples, risk management, action for climate empowerment, regulatory aspects, research and development, as well as their alignment with compliance with frameworks. national and international regulations (PND 2030, ODS, Sendai Framework).</p>
  <h4>4.4.2 Scope of priority sectors</h4>

  <h3>4.6 Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E)</h3>
  <p>Paraguay's First Adaptation Communication establishes the bases for the development of a National Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E), which measures the achievement of the goals and objectives for each priority sector, and the impact of the measures implemented to increase the capacity to adapt to climate change.</p>
  <p>This process will be carried out from the implementation of the Project: "Establishment of a comprehensive MRV / M & E System to improve climate transparency in Paraguay" (under the CBIT modality), which has the objective of strengthening transparency systems Paraguayan institutions, in order to comply with the requirements of the Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and aspects related to mitigation, adaptation and financing.</p>
  <h2>5. MITIGATION IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
  <h3>5.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT</h3>
  <p>The Republic of Paraguay, by the current National Constitution, is a Social State of Law, unitary and decentralized with a democratic, representative, pluralistic and participatory system, with distinguished natural capital and an economic system of free trade, which favors free movement of financial resources and the movement of capital, as an open market economy for both import and export. Primary production (agricultural and livestock) represents the base of socio-economic activity, which is boosted by agro-industrialization and export of commodities, contributing annually up to 50% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Investor, 2015) . In addition to this, there are other national circumstances, such as a highly renewable energy matrix,</p>
  <p>These national circumstances, typical of the development of countries with abundant natural capital, are reflected in the historical net emissions profile. Thus, for example, based on the latest National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI), officially reported in the Second Biennial Update Report (IBA2), for the year 2015 (last year of the time series addressed), total national emissions amounted to 75,099.9 Gg CO2 eq, of which ≈32% corresponded to absorptions, resulting in a net annual emission of ≈68%.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that in the time series (1990-2015) considered until 2013, the Sector of Land Use, Changes in Land Use and Forestry (LULUCF) represented the highest percentage of contribution to the country's net emissions (See graph 4) However, this sector experienced a significant reduction in its emissions in 2015, after which it was possible to obtain a historical recognition of payment for results for the reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD + ), through the Green Climate Fund (GCF).</p>
  <p><strong>Graph 3</strong> Profile of historical net emissions (Gg CO2 eq), reported by Paraguay for the time series 1990-2015.</p>
  <p><img src="img/PRY-NDC1-3.png" alt="PRY-NDC1-3"></p>
  <p>Source: MADES / UNDP / GEF (2019).</p>
  <p>However, considering the concepts of equity, climate justice and the sovereign right to sustainable development of the countries, the following should be highlighted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Very small historical contribution of the Republic of Paraguay to global GHG emissions (≤0.01%) (Ritchie and Roser, 2020) despite its high vulnerability to climate change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Contribution of the country to the achievement of global objectives such as food security, in accordance with the vision of the National Development Plan Paraguay 2030, which envisions it as a global food platform, in the context of its sustainable development.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, aiming at sustainable development, under the Paris Agreement, Paraguay has committed since its first NDC in 2015, a goal of reducing 20% of projected emissions by 2030, being 10% uncon / conditioned and 10% conditional, to the international provision of the means of implementation.</p>
  <p>To achieve the goal, the country has built public policy instruments, based on the Paraguay 2030 PND, the National Climate Change Policy (PNCC) and the National Environmental Policy (PAN, in the process of updating), among which are find the Mitigation Strategy (2014), the National Climate Change Mitigation Plan and its 7 Action Programs (2017) and the current Sector Plans, later referred to as Climate Change Mitigation Plans (PMCC), which present 45 measures tangible and referential measures for national climate action on mitigation, for the next few years.</p>

          <p>To this end, the National Directorate for Climate Change (DNCC) of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MADES) has coordinated the preparation of annual emissions / mitigation projections: at the national and sectoral level, during the implementation period of the NDC (2014 -2030).</p>

Reference Scenarios).</p>
          <p>To calculate the percentage of deviation from the BAU emissions projected to 2030, Climate Change Mitigation Scenarios were prepared (see Section 5.5.), Taking as inputs the mitigation potential calculations of the prioritized sectoral measures.</p>

          <p>Starting from the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities for climate action by developed and developing countries, taking into account the concepts of equity, climate justice and the National Circumstances of Adaptation and Mitigation (see Sections 4.1 . and 5.1. Country Context), the Republic of Paraguay, considers this NDC ambitious, because:</p>
          <p>-With respect to Art. 4.3, although the global value of the mitigation goal is maintained at 20%, the projected BAU value of emissions to 2030 is adjusted.</p>
          <p>-The development of the 5 Sectoral Plans for Climate Change Mitigation (PMCC) represents a tangible effort by the country to address mitigation PAMs, in all socio-economic sectors (encouraged by Art. 4.4./CMA.1) , in the short and medium term.</p>
          <p>-Information is provided to facilitate transparency and the review of the country's mitigation PAMs in the First IBT, in accordance with the Modalities, Guidelines and Procedures of the Enhanced Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement, including optional information such as the scenarios of mitigation “with and without LULUCF Sector measures” and addressing mitigation measures contemplating main / non-main categories of INGEI (eg enteric fermentation, use of forest and agricultural land, combustion for land transport etc.)</p>
          <p>It should be emphasized in this regard, the immutable commitment to continuous improvement existing by the country, according to its national circumstances and the effective availability of the means of implementation (encouraged by Art. 4.6./CMA.1)</p>
          <p>-It will serve as the basis for future reviews and the outline of the Low Emissions Development Strategy, in accordance with the socio-political decision empowered by the national sovereignty. In this sense, it is necessary to affirm that the international commitments assumed in climate matters should not be considered paradoxical to the national premises of development and hypothetically the strengthening of national capacities will allow to reflect to a greater extent the implementation of good practices and technological innovations, developed in the country.</p>
          <p>-The reporting exercise of the First Adaptation Communication, with the identification of vulnerable sectors, undoubtedly represents another effort by the country to integrate said component in its development planning, considering that there are no standardized methodologies / indicators that reflect the greater effort that developing countries must incur (together with the Mediterranean condition of countries such as Paraguay) to develop in a context of high vulnerability or affected by climate change.</p>

  <h3>5.3 BAU SCENARIOS (“BUSINESS AS USUAL”) FROM PARAGUAY TO 2030</h3>
  <p>The “Business as Usual” (BAU) Scenarios correspond to the scenarios where all the policies and measures applied, approved and planned will be excluded from the year chosen as the starting point. Emissions / removals are projected based on macro-economic variables such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population growth and other variables that correlate with GHG emissions / removals, both sectoral (see section 5.3.1.) as nationals (see section 5.3.2.).</p>
  <p>The influence of the driver variables on GHG emissions / removals were estimated based on the goodness of fit parameters, produced by the econometric models used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Theoretical model type "Cobb Douglas" by the method of Feasible Generalized Least Squares (top - down approach), for all projections (national and sectoral, except those of the Energy sector and the Transport subsector), using the "R" software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2021).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>General Equilibrium Model, for more detailed projections of the Energy Sector (bottom up approach), through the use of LEAP software (Stockholm Environment Institute, 2021).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>5.3.1 Sectoral BAU scenarios</h4>
  <p>For the construction of the sectoral BAU scenarios, we started from the values of net emissions = emissions-removals, officially reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in the INGEI of the Second Biennial Update Report ( IBA2), comprising the time series from 1990 to 2015.</p>
  <p>Subsequently, following the methodology described in the previous section 5.3., We proceeded to collect the data of the “drivers” variables, which are related and constitute explanatory of the behavior pattern of net GHG emissions, which are specified together with their main sources of information in table 1.</p>

  <h4>5.3.2 Updated national BAU scenario</h4>
  <p>Table and graph 5 show a comparison of the base data (n) and the projected values of net GHG emissions to 2030, proposed in the NDC of Paraguay to 2015 and the current update of 2021; These show that for the 2015 projections, the data available up to that moment were limited to 4 emissions calculations reported in 2011 in the country's Second National Communication (2CN, using the 1996 IPPC Methodological Guide), while for The projections of this NDC were considered a total of 26 observations of the INGEI reported in the IBA2 (2018, using the 2006 IPPC Methodological Guide), covering the time series 1990-2015.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, for the 2015 projections, it was assumed that the annual GDP growth rate (projected up to 6.60%) was equal to the growth of GHG emissions, considering a GDP / GHG ratio with elasticity equal to 1.</p>

  <h3>5.4 INSTRUMENTS: CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION PLANS (PMCC) IN PARAGUAY BY 2030</h3>
  <p>As mentioned, the mitigation component for updating the NDC of the Republic of Paraguay is based on the development of Climate Change Mitigation Plans (PMCC), in the 5 sectors of INGEI.</p>
  <p>These PMCCs, aligned with the Paraguay 2030 National Development Plan and other sectoral policy instruments, are viewed as tangible and referential milestones for national climate action, in terms of mitigation during the next few years, presenting below the 45 mitigation measures prioritized in the different sectors, taking into account the technical and economic feasibility criteria for its implementation.</p>
  <p>It is worth mentioning that the mitigation measures prioritized in the current PMCC as well as the calculations of mitigation potentials are referential. Therefore, the measures and impacts of the PMCC will be reviewed and / or updated in the First IBT of the country.</p>
  <h4>5.4.1 Priority measures for the Climate Change Mitigation Plan for the Agriculture Sector (PMCC-AG)</h4>
  <p>Table 6 presents a structured summary of the 7 prioritized mitigation measures for the Agriculture Sector, which are focused on agricultural-livestock integration (including rice cultivation with cattle), efficient use and of nitrogen fertilizers, to good practices in rice production and livestock of domestic ruminant species.</p>
  <p>Note that, given the assumptions established for the projections to 2030, except for measures 2 and 5, the others are considered in a state of “planning” and the mitigation potential calculations, which will be examined in the First IBT of Paraguay, at the For the purposes of this NDC, they have been outlined only in cases of availability of precise or consolidated data to establish the baseline.</p>
  <p>In view of the assumptions established for the projections to 2030, the measures are considered in a state of “planning”, except for measures 2 and 5, and the mitigation potential calculations will be examined in the First IBT of Paraguay.

  <h4>5.4.5 Priority measures for the Energy and Transport Sector Climate Change Mitigation Plan (PMCC-ENyTR)</h4>
  <p>Taking into account national circumstances, with an energy matrix highly dependent on renewable sources (mainly still on forest biomass and a world-leading “clean” hydroelectric production), in addition to the majority share of sectoral GHG emissions (&gt; 80% , based on the transport category or subsector), the energy sector mitigation measures were specifically surveyed for both the energy sector (see section 5.4.5.1) and transport (see section 5.4.5.2.); The sectoral mitigation scenarios have been constructed to contrast them with the sectoral BAU scenario projected to 2030, using the LEAP tool.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that the measures, assumptions and scenarios of the energy sector were proposed in close connection with the public policies “applied or approved” (For example, the National Development Plan Paraguay 2030, the National Energy Policy 2040, the exemption tax on the importation of electric vehicles through Law No. 5183/14 and the update of the Transportation Master Plan (MOPC, 2018) etc.).</p>
  <h5>5.4.5.1 Priority mitigation measures for the Energy Sector (EN)</h5>
  <p>For this sector, through consultation with sector experts, the following mitigation measures were prioritized (9):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>IN 1. The use of certified forest biomass, contemplated by Decree No. 4056/2015: “Regimes for Certification, Control and Promotion of the Use of Renewable Bioenergies”.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>EN.2. Optimal use of energy by applying energy efficiency measures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>IN 3. Improvement of the quality of the fossil fuels used. It should be noted that this measure implicitly implies technological innovation (eg improvement in the use of ultra-low sulfur fuels, requiring modernization of the vehicle fleet).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>IN 4. Promotion of sustainable buildings in cities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>IN 5. Renewable energy promotion projects of the Binational Entity TAIPU (Ex. For the use of solar thermo-heaters, biodigesters, ecofogones, solar panels in isolated locations in the Chaco; promotion of sustainable mobility, prototypes and electric vehicles; research on hybrid systems ( solar, wind, thermal) more efficient for generating electricity, etc.).</p>
      <p>Although no specific scenarios have been built, regarding the potential of renewable energies in Paraguay, a recent evaluation (May, 2021) carried out by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA, for its acronym in English) indicates a large hydroelectric capacity. , wind and solar potential from low to medium level (mainly in the Departments of Boquerón, Alto Paraguay, Presidente Hayes and the Southwest Region of the country), in addition to a great potential of bioenergy and biofuels and green hydrogen, as aspects to consider future, for the country's energy scenarios, mainly considering the increasingly competitive costs of renewable energy technologies (eg batteries, charging infrastructures, etc.) at present.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>EN.6. Efficient or Improved Kitchens Program, through the Poverty, Reforestation, Energy and Climate Change Project (PROEZA).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>EN.7. Guidelines of the National Energy Efficiency Plan of Paraguay (VMME, 2014).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>EN.8. Guidelines of the National Energy Policy to 2040, approved by Decree No. 6092/2016.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>IN. 9. Guidelines of the PND Paraguay 2030, on energy matters.</p>
      <p>In view of the hypotheses adopted, taking into account the different development plans to be implemented in the energy sector in the coming years and the technical characteristics of the measures, these would translate into an increase in the country's energy demand projections in the different sub-sectors (in particular the industry sub-sector), therefore the mitigation potentials of GHG emissions would only be observed after 2030 and are not reported in the current update of the NDC to 2030. No However, the review of these potentials is recommended for the preparation of the National Strategy for Low Emissions Development of the Republic of Paraguay, by 2050.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>5.4.5.2 Priority mitigation measures for the Transport Sector (TR).</p>
  <p>For this sector, through the mechanism of surveys and workshops with sector experts, the following mitigation measures were prioritized by 2030 (4):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>TR.1. The increasing substitution of fossil fuels for biofuels (depending on the type of engine, up to 7.5% addition to diesel and 27.5% addition to gasoline). This measure, as well as that of the use of better quality fossil fuels, implies the innovation of the vehicle fleet to cleaner and more efficient technologies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>TR.2. Efficient driving for public and freight transport.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>TR.3. The increasing replacement of conventional vehicles by electric and hybrid vehicles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>TR.4. The H-green application. These last 2 measures are expected in an increasing percentage of penetration to the land vehicle fleet, ranging from 0.01% participation in tractor-trailers (electric or H-green) to 33.4% in public passenger transport ( with electric minibuses) by 2030.</p>
      <p>Based on the measures identified and their combination, 5 mitigation scenarios were built, with increasing levels of ambition:</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first consisted of the BAU Scenario (with conventional mixtures of biofuels, migration to fuel flex, from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and naphtha), considering the measures already applied for its construction. In this scenario, modifications for river and air transport were not considered.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>In Scenario 2, an increase in the percentage of diesel and biodiesel blends is considered, while the alcohol-gasoline blends maintain the same proportions as scenario 1. Furthermore, efficient driving / driving is considered to reduce consumption of fuels for land transport, specifically that of public passenger transport (minibuses and buses) and freight transport. In this scenario, modifications for land transport are considered.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In Scenario 3, in addition to considering the previous measures, the penetration of electric vehicles and H-green is considered. In this scenario, measures in land and river transport are already considered, and given their medium level of ambition, they are subsequently considered for the purposes of the construction of the national mitigation scenarios by 2030.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In Scenario 4, in addition to the measures applied in Scenario 3, the introduction of diesel rail transport to move loads over medium and long distances is considered. In addition, in road transport it is considered that from the year 2025 electric motorcycles will enter, reaching a penetration level of 20% of the total motorcycle fleet by 2050. This measure responds to the hypothesis that market forces, for Scenario 4, will be such that they will drive motorcycle users to opt for electric mobility.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In Scenario 5 and of greater ambition, the measures applied in Scenario 4 are considered, but with the difference that the rail transport for cargo mobilization will be electric. In addition, in road transport it is considered that from the year 2025 electric motorcycles will enter, reaching a penetration level of 30% of the total motorcycle fleet by 2050. This measure responds to the hypothesis that market forces, for Scenario 5, will be such that they will drive motorcycle users to opt for electric mobility, and a penetration percentage is considered higher than the previous scenario (30% ).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Scenarios 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent the mitigation scenarios themselves (“all with planned measures”) in relation to current GHG emissions from Scenario 1 (“BAU or with applied measures”). In addition, as can be seen in Table 10, only in Scenario 5, reduction of emissions ≥20% is achieved by the year 2030. However, for the purposes of construction of the National Mitigation Scenario of Paraguay by 2030, the scenario 3, with an intermediate level of ambition.</p>

  <h3>5.5 MITIGATION SCENARIOS IN THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY BY 2030</h3>
  <p>The mitigation scenarios considered are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Scenario “with measures”: including mitigation measures “that are currently in force or that have been approved since 2014”;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Scenario "with additional measures": including "planned" mitigation measures, in addition to those "applied and approved since 2014".</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The emission projections in the mitigation scenarios were estimated by subtracting from the BAU scenarios by 2030, the estimates of the GHG emission reductions achieved and projected through the prioritized measures in the 5 Climate Change Mitigation Plans. It should be noted that due to limiting factors such as the lack of data, information and / or methodological challenges, it has not been possible to estimate the mitigation potential of all mitigation measures (generically known as Policies, Actions and Measures or PAM), The values presented for the scenarios are preliminary and indicative, not necessarily representing the emission reductions that the country will be able to obtain strictly. Therefore, the updated value of emissions in the BAU scenario and the mitigation potential of the PAMs by 2030,</p>
  <p>As can be seen in table 11 and graph 5, considering the level of emissions of the BAU scenario for the year 2030 (102,542 Gg CO2 eq), the country would have the commitment to report by 2030, through its INGEI, emissions net of 92,287 Gg CO2 eq (due to the "Unconditional Reduction Contribution" = - 10%) or 82,033 Gg CO2 eq (due to the "Conditional Reduction Contribution" = - 10% additional).</p>
  <p>On the other hand, considering the status of the measures (according to Paragraph 94 of Annex I of Decision 18 / CMA.1), the sectorial measures prioritized in the 5 Climate Change Mitigation Plans (including those of the LULUCF sector) " approved and in application ”would allow the country to achieve a reduction of -36% in the level of emissions by 2030; while the ““ planned, approved and applied ”measures (including those of the LULUCF sector) would allow the country to achieve a reduction of up to -55% in relation to the BAU scenario by 2030. However, note that without the prioritized measures to In the UTCTUS sector, the emission reductions would be -1% and -2%, for the “with measures” and “with additional measures” scenarios, respectively.</p>

  <h3>5.6 CONTRIBUTION OF SECTORAL PLANS TO THE COMPLIANCE OF THE SDGS BY 2030</h3>
  <p>As can be seen in Table 12, in addition to the contribution to the fulfillment of SDG 13, the sectoral measures contemplated in the PMCC contribute directly and indirectly to the fulfillment of at least 5 other SDGs (e.g. agriculture and livestock and waste, to production patterns sustainable-SDG 12 and water savings in demanding crops such as rice and the effective treatment of effluents-SDG 6; in addition to other socio-economic benefits such as poverty reduction-SDG 1, contribution to food security-SDG 2 , to employment and economic growth-SDG 8), etc.</p>
  <p>In the case of the LULUCF sector, the direct alignment of the measures to SDG 15 for the sustainable management of forests and the fight against soil degradation is highlighted, as well as the production of forest biomass to SDG 7, which also it is promoted by other renewable sources in the energy sector and the burning of methane gas from landfill waste; for the IPPU sector measures, collaboration to achieve SDG 9 in relation to technological innovation and energy and waste sector measures to SDG 3 and 11, in relation to transport, sustainable urbanization and a healthy environment.</p>

  <h3>5.7 SUPPORT NEEDS</h3>
  <p>The support needs required for the effective implementation of the mitigation measures are detailed in Chapter 6, while the information for the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of the same in the Annexes of the Mitigation Component.</p>
  <h2>6. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
  <p>The means of implementation constitute complementary and necessary elements to achieve the adaptation objectives and the mitigation measures identified in the update of the Nationally Determined Contribution.</p>
  <p>Building and strengthening capacities (Art.11, Paris Agreement), climate finance (Art.9, Paris Agreement) and technology development, transfer and innovation (Art.10, Paris Agreement) are the three (3) fundamental pillars to advance towards the ambitious implementation of the NDC of Paraguay by 2030.</p>
  <h3>6.1 CONSTRUCTION AND STRENGTHENING OF CAPACITIES.</h3>
  <p>This means of implementation seeks to strengthen the processes of training, empowerment, awareness, research and transparency that allow consolidating existing technical capacities as well as building new capacities of key actors, decision makers, national technicians, academia and civil society.</p>
  <p>Based on the needs detected, the following lines of action are proposed for 2025:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Public awareness and education for climate action.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Construction and strengthening of permanent technical skills in prioritized areas and sectors for the fulfillment of climate commitments.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Strengthening the institutional framework and empowerment for climate action through the design of training programs and continuous training on climate change, with an emphasis on compliance with the NDC of Paraguay.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Integration of the gender perspective and attention to vulnerable communities for the elaboration of climate policies, programs and action plans.</p>

      <p>Promotion of international technical exchange regarding development, challenges and gaps for compliance with the NDC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Training to strengthen the National Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) Systems as well as Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) to monitor the progress of the NDC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Capacity-building for Judges, Court Members and operators of the different judicial districts of the country within the framework of the process of granting certificates according to the provisions of Article 12 of Law No. 3001/2006 “On the valuation and remuneration of the environmental services".</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>6.2 CLIMATE FINANCING</h3>
  <p>The objective of this means of implementation is to strengthen the management of financial resources allocated to climate change in such a way that they are aligned with the financing needs for the implementation of the NDC.</p>
  <p>Next, the needs, progress and lines of action for 2025 are cited:</p>
  <h4>6.2.1 Climate financing needs.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Analysis of the costs associated with the full implementation of the NDC assumed by 2030.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Analysis of national public spending on climate change that allows cataloging activities and programs related to adaptation and mitigation in the General Budget of the Nation (PGN).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Official mechanism that can identify and evaluate climate financial flows for the consolidation of the National Monitoring, Reporting and Verification System for Transparency (SN-MRVT).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Development and access to financial mechanisms that allow the sustainability of the conservation units that make up the National System of Protected Wild Areas (SINASIP).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above needs can be met by considering the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Have parameters to identify climate investments or expenditures in all national (public and private) and international economic sectors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Expand the legal framework to regulate the registration of all national and international climate support received, including participation in voluntary carbon markets.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Position Paraguay before the Green Climate Fund (GCF), strengthening the Country Program, the methodology for evaluation, identification and prioritization of projects (portfolio), which must be aligned with public policies and international climate commitments, such as the National Development Plan Paraguay 2030 and the NDC.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>6.2.2 Advances in climate finance</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Through Law No. 5875/17, the National Climate Change Fund (FNCC) has been created whose purpose is to attract and apply public, private, national and international financial resources that support the implementation of actions to face climate change . This Law establishes that adaptation actions will be a priority in the application of the Fund and grants MADES exclusive competence to identify, obtain, plan, manage and apply the financial resources entered in the FNCC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An Ad-Hoc Committee on Finance for Climate Change has been formed within the framework of the National Climate Change Commission with the objective of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>define the current scenario and the climate financing needs of the country;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>work on the institutional arrangements necessary for the development of a mechanism that can identify, analyze and measure financial flows related to climate change;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>expand the scope to develop strategies, raise funds / resources and seek financing mechanisms with a view to complying with the NDC of Paraguay.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Paraguay is developing its Third Biennial Update Report (IBA3) which will present improved information in order to be able to identify the destination of the funds (adaptation, mitigation, capacity building, technology, others) and the type of financial instrument ( donation, loan, guarantee, payment for results, etc.)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>6.2.3 Lines of action to 2025.</h4>
  <p>Based on the needs identified and the progress made by the country, the following lines of action are proposed for 2025:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Estimate of the costs associated with the full implementation of the NDC including the Adaptation Communication.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Analysis of the private investment climate of the sectors prioritized in the NDC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Preparation of the National Funding Strategy for the implementation of the NDC and other climate action initiatives.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Creation of incentives to promote and sustain private sector investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation actions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Development of a financial mechanism that facilitates access to climate finance for the implementation of the NDC and other climate action initiatives.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>6.3 DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
  <p>Paraguay, in its NDC, proposes adaptation objectives and mitigation measures that require strong development, adoption and transfer of technologies.</p>
  <p>Along these lines, the country is promoting mechanisms that promote technology transfer, which in turn facilitate research and analysis of appropriate technological solutions to reduce vulnerability and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, including those that guarantee the poverty reduction, food and nutrition security (SAN).</p>
  <p>In 2021, with the support of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in Paraguay, the project “Guidance and technical support to carry out a Technological Needs Assessment (TNA) and a Technological Action Plan will begin. (TAP, for its acronym in English) ”that will help the country to assess priority technology needs and harmonize the development of the country towards a transition that contributes to achieving the objectives of the NDC in a viable, efficient and innovative way.</p>
  <p>The timely evaluation of the priority technological needs and the construction of the Technological Action Plan, without a doubt, will be a fundamental pillar for the effective implementation of the measures and actions established in the update of the NDC.</p>
  <p>The expected results are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A Technology Needs Assessment and a Technology Action Plan to be reported to the UNFCCC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A platform for the transfer and development of technologies available in the different state digital sites, including the creation of a platform for the exchange of information on the TNA and the progress in the implementation of the TAP.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Strengthening the capacities of all key actors in terms of development and transfer of technologies for climate action.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>6.4 ANALYSIS OF THE LEVEL OF REQUIREMENT OF THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION FOR UPDATING THE NDC</h3>
  <p>The annexes present the results of the identification of the required level of need: high, medium or low, in the 3 means of implementation and for each of the adaptation objectives and mitigation measures identified in the update of the NDC.</p>
  <h2>7. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF THE NDC</h2>
  <p>Under the principle of continuous improvement of the NDC, the main advances achieved by the country in relation to the First NDC (in force since 2016) are included, due to the Approval of the Paris Agreement (ratified by Law No. 5681 / 16); and updating it.</p>
  <h3>7.1 IMPROVEMENTS MADE REGARDING THE FIRST NDC OF PARAGUAY</h3>
  <p>Figure 1 illustrates the main improvements achieved in the 2016 First NDC update, which are described in detail in the following sections.</p>
  <p><strong>Figure 1</strong> Main improvements achieved in the update of the First NDC</p>
  <p><img src="img/PRY-NDC1-6.png" alt="PRY-NDC1-6"></p>
  <p>Source: DNCC / MADES (2021)</p>
  <h4>7.1.1 Improvements achieved in the Adaptation Component.</h4>
  <p>As illustrated in Figure 1, in the First NDC of Paraguay, adaptation was defined as a priority component for the country and the prioritized sectors were stated. The criterion for these prioritizations is vulnerability to climatic factors by the activities on which its economy is based (mainly in primary production). In addition to this, due to the condition of a landlocked country, trade is carried out across bordering borders using long transport services, both land and river (using rivers whose navigability, in turn, depends on climatic variability).</p>
  <p>Since the ratification of the NDC to the present, the country has made great strides in providing a guiding framework, as well as offering tools to promote adaptation at the national and local levels. Thus, the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (2015) and its corresponding Implementation Plan were drawn up: National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (2017), in addition to the Guide for the Preparation of Local and Sectoral Plans for Adaptation to Climate Change (2018). These tools have promoted the development of Climate Action Plans in various local governments, as well as the National Plan for Disaster Risk Management and Adaptation to Climate Change in the Agricultural Sector of Paraguay (MAG / FAO, 2016).</p>
  <p>In the present update of the NDC, Paraguay has managed to redefine the priority sectors (7), including those that are not only important for economic development, but also consider social, environmental and cultural aspects. On the other hand, these sectors establish objectives (25), with their lines of action and needs and gaps, identified in a broad participatory process (n = 481 participants), involving the Central, Local Government, Civil Society, Private Sector and the Academy. Additionally, the bases have been identified and established to build a National Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E), which should be implemented in all sectors through institutional arrangements.</p>
  <h4>7.1.2 Improvements achieved in the Mitigation Component.</h4>
  <p>In this update, it has been possible to adjust the GHG emissions projections in the BAU (“Business as Usual” national and sectoral scenario according to various driver variables through historical data from the INGEI and projections built with econometric models ), as well as presenting mitigation scenarios, based on the 5 Sectoral Climate Change Mitigation Plans (PMCC).</p>
  <p>Another improvement in the update of the First NDC of Paraguay is the presentation of the mitigation potential of the scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>With measures: including mitigation measures "that are in application or have been approved" since 2014;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>With additional measures: including "planned, approved and applied" mitigation measures. These advances lay the foundations for future revisions and / or updates, to be carried out within the framework of the First Biennial Transparency Report (IBT).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>7.2 IMPROVEMENTS TO CONSIDER FOR THE NEXT NDC OF PARAGUAY</h3>
  <h4>7.2.1 Improvements to consider for the Adaptation Component</h4>
  <p>In accordance with Art. 4 of the Paris Agreement, it is established that the Parties present or update their NDC every 5 years and that each of them represents a progression with respect to the previous one. In this context, the goals are specified in several edges, which need to be addressed to obtain a comprehensive and solid result for the commitments, classifying the necessary improvements in the following items:</p>
<p><strong>Political - legal and institutional articulation</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Establish arrangements between those key institutions for the fulfillment of adaptation goals.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Strengthen the link with organizations and groups that assist indigenous peoples, women, youth and children, for the development of strategic actions that increase their capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Define with the corresponding sector institutions, the indicators and means of verification to create / strengthen the process of creating the National M&amp;E System.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Establish the appropriate mechanism with the Technical Secretariat for Planning of Economic and Social Development (STP) and the current National Institute of Statistics (INE) to identify / create the adaptation indicators linked to the PND 2030 and its corresponding monitoring. It is also important to take into account those indicators that will be used to measure progress in adaptation to climate change, as defined in the departmental and district planning instruments.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Establish a National Registry of adaptation and mitigation actions, provided for in the Draft Decree by which Law No. 5875/17 is regulated.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Sectoral and territorial articulation</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>

  <h4>7.2.2 Improvements to consider for the Mitigation Component</h4>
  <p>In response to paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, Paraguay intends to continue advancing with improvements in the projections of GHG emissions from the BAU and mitigation scenarios; and in the calculation of estimates of GHG emissions removals and reductions.</p>
  <p>In particular, the country aims to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Review the econometric models used to calculate the BAU and mitigation scenarios, particularly in relation to the assumptions and the main technical and economic parameters used;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Review the BAU and mitigation scenarios, using updated information about GHG emissions / removals that will be reported in future Greenhouse Gas Inventories (INGEI), and updated information about the 5PMCC;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Review the list and prioritization of the 5 PMCC measures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Review and / or complement the calculation of the estimates of emission reductions and GHG absorption, when adequate information is available.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Progress will be guided in accordance with the requirements established by the “Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines” for the framework of transparency of the measures and the support referred to in Art. 13 of the Paris Agreement ”(Decision 18 / CMA .1) and other relevant decisions of the Katowice Package.</p>
  <p>For this, the country requires the strengthening of capacities, financial support and technology as means of implementation to meet the adaptation and mitigation goals by 2030, which were detailed in Chapter 6.</p>
  <h2>8. TRANSPARENCY</h2>
  <p>In compliance with Art. 4.8 and 4.13 / CMA.1, this update provides the necessary information for the communication and subsequent monitoring of the NDC of the Republic of Paraguay by 2030, highlighting that, as has been emphasized in subsections 7.1 . and 7.2 .:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Improvements achieved in relation to the First NDC of 2016, transparency constitutes one of the greatest attributes, in its update exercise to 2021.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Recommendations for improvement for the NDC for the following five-year period, it is worth highlighting the consideration of the Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines established by Decision 18 / CMA.1, for the transition to the Reinforced Transparency Framework referred to in Article 13 of the Agreement. from Paris.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this sense, it should be considered that the periodic monitoring of what is proposed in this update will allow to advance or take appropriate actions, to achieve the climate goals established, in relation to the global objectives of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>Governance for this purpose is established in National Law No. 5875/17 on Climate Change, whose main purpose is to “contribute to implementing actions that reduce vulnerability, improve adaptation capacity and allow the development of mitigation proposals for carbon emissions. GHG ”, through planning and urgent, coordinated and sustained response to climate change.</p>
  <h3>8.1 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&amp;E) OF THE ADAPTATION COMPONENT</h3>
  <p>The description of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) approach of the First Adaptation Communication is presented in section 4.6., While that of the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of the Mitigation Component of the NDC, is presented to continuation.</p>
  <h3>8.2 MONITORING, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION (MRV) OF THE MITIGATION COMPONENT</h3>
  <p>In order to follow the guidelines of the Reinforced Transparency Framework (MTR) and that the country has a solid National MRV System, necessary for accountability and in turn, for decision-making in its next NDC, it is presented then, as a preview, an analysis of the background and future proposals for its consolidation.</p>
  <h4>8.2.1. Background of a national proposal for MRV</h4>
  <p>The Second Biennial Update Report (IBA2 of MADES / UNDP / GEF, 2018) reported a proposal for an MRV system where the progress of the implementation of the different mitigation measures must be communicated and recorded in the National Climate Change System or Platform , currently constituted by the Environmental Information System (SIAM) of MADES. Said report proposed that the monitoring system at the national or domestic level include the following components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>MRV of GHG Emissions / Absorption: for the development of the National Inventories of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI), as well as other additional technical studies that are prepared within the framework of specific programs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>MRV of Mitigation Policies, Actions and Plans (PAM): relates to the monitoring of the progress of the measures, including Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) and Low Emission Development Strategies (known as LED for its acronym in English).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Implicit in this system is the MRV of REDD +: within the framework of the National Forest Monitoring System that contains information from the National Forest Inventory (IFN), the Satellite Terrestrial Monitoring System (SSMT) (carried out by INFONA, and with the quality control of MADES), the INGEI of the LULUCF Sector.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>M&amp;E of Adaptation Activities: implies the monitoring of the National Adaptation Plan (s) (NAP) where specific goals and indicators should be identified for follow-up according to the prioritized sectors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>MRV of the Support received and the Financing Needs: the component is based on the need to measure, report and verify the availability of the means of implementation. In the case of non-Annex I countries, such as Paraguay, it could also serve to identify financing needs;</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although progress has been made in recent years for each proposed component, it is still necessary to strengthen them and consider the necessary flexibility to adjust to national requirements and circumstances. Taking as a starting point the proposal for the existing national MRV system and the reporting and review requirements established by Decision 18 / CMA.1 for the Transparency Framework; the incorporation of the MRV of the NDC to the Mitigation Component is recommended, aiming at a "National System of Measurement, Monitoring and Verification for Transparency (SN-MRVT)" that will have as objective the management and adequate collection of all the necessary information the preparation of the “Biennial Transparency Reports” (BTR, for its acronym in English).</p>
  <p>However, although the MRV system follows a sequential scheme, due to the principle of continuous improvement, it is not exempt from being a dynamic process, which requires constant feedback, which must be considered when implementing and giving follow-up to NDC goals.</p>
  <p>In relation to the need for constant review of MRV systems, and in this particular case that of the NDC of the SN-MRVT, the following will be considered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The revisions of the 5 PMCC, including the possibility of removal / inclusion of new PAMs that are relevant to the NDC;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The reviews of the sectoral and national projections (in particular of the projections “with measures”);</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The recommendations of the external technical examination and,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Examples of good national and international practices.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Finally, as the Mitigation Component of the SN-MRVT must be able to monitor, report and verify the reduction of emissions associated with the implementation of the PMCC measures, it should be housed in the Climate Change Module of the SIAM (making use of of the specific sectoral MRV systems that exist in the country).</p>
