  <h1><a>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h1>
  <p>The Paris Agreement (PA) seeks to limit the global temperature increase to under 2°C- and towards 1.5°C- above pre-industrial levels. This calls for a radical change across countries, reflected in commitments made in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Such a call to action for climate change mitigation is particularly crucial for Sierra Leone in terms of adaptation, being ranked one of the least able countries to adapt to climate change in the world. The country is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, with a growing number of people at risk to extreme events, and significant impacts on the economy. This reality drives proposals made in the country’s Medium-Term National Development Plan (MTNDP) in 2019, which both stresses the need for aligning environmental, climate, and economic development plans to stage proactive efforts to <i>mitigate</i> the causes of global warming and help vulnerable citizens in both rural and urban settings to effectively <i>adapt</i> to climate change over the long term.</p>
  <p>Sierra Leone’s NDC responds to Article 4, paragraph 2 of the PA, which requires parties to the UNFCCC to prepare, communicate and maintain successive NDCs that they intend to achieve. It also aligns with the MTNDP, AU Vision 2063, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These national and regional strategies lay a solid foundation for determining (i) opportunities for adaptation and mitigation, in terms of actions to prioritise; (ii) sectoral policies, plans, and strategies that align with NDC priorities; and (iii) institutional arrangements and organisational structures to strengthen for effective, efficient, and equitable climate action over the next ten years. Accordingly, the updated NDC is grounded in the country’s development and sectoral policies, strategies, and frameworks. Such an alignment will improve results tracking, identification of potential implementation partners, and maximising local resources. Moreover, demonstrating linkages between the NDC and national and international plans and strategies helps to map where the resources and well-functioning institutions and processes already exist, including which actors at the national, subnational, and sectoral levels to involve in implementation, monitoring, verification, and reporting activities.</p>
  <p>With climate risks and impacts affecting various sectors and population groups in different ways, differentiated, sector-based measures for both adaptation and mitigation have been proposed (as project and policy actions) to deal with current and emerging vulnerabilities, as well as contribute to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The measures build upon lessons learned and experiences gained from implementing actions in the previous NDC1 and working with international and local development partners on various environmental and climate actions. Development partners and national structures can implement these measures through their own strategies, policies, and operations, although current arrangements for coordination will be in full swing to ensure joint planning and shared action, which is critical to closing current gaps in data, finance, and project standards.</p>
  <p>Accordingly, the NDC envisions to achieve long-term goals for mitigation: a reduction in CO2 emission levels to 5% by 2025, 10% by 2030, and 25% by 2050, with a transformational shift toward a low-emission development pathway, by targeting priority sectors, implementing REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) as well as promoting innovation and technology transfer for sustainable breakthroughs in energy, waste management, transport, agriculture, etc. Technology transfer through private sector partnerships will create new markets, provide jobs, and support economic growth, while reducing GHG emissions.</p>
  <p>In terms of adaptation, the objective drawn from the iNAP is to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability by half by 2030. The NDC seeks to mainstream climate considerations into sustainable development strategies to build resilience at the local level while promoting environmental benefits in an integrated manner at the national level. Given the scope for action in the proposed action plans, the Government of Sierra Leone will push for actions that drive synergies at the national and subnational level. Such actions will typically focus on promoting policies and developing institutional links that drive both mitigation and adaptation, highlighting synergies in proposed actions at multiple scales (from local to global), mainstreaming climate considerations into broader development actions, and ensuring that the financing architecture addresses synergies between adaptation and mitigation.</p>
  <p>In practice, NDC actions will roll-out broad-based measures covering all main emitters and vulnerabilities using a range of instruments, including financial and technological support. The actions have a total value of around USD 2,764 billion (including both conditional and unconditional contributions).</p>
  <p>National contributions send a strong message about the current political commitment to climate action and demonstrate that NDC implementation will be domestically driven and owned- undertaken to strengthen national and subnational institutions and governance systems. At the same time, the Sierra Leone updated NDC measures reflect the growing local focus on merging top-down policy guidance with bottom-up planning, which is essential to a circular learning process that builds capacity for long-term support and commitment to implementation. Similarly, the long timeframes proposed promote long-range planning and allows for accessing long-term financing, which is critical to delivering large-scale results. Furthermore, institutions identified for implementation and the gender and social inclusion issues covered, lays a solid foundation for strategic partnerships and cross-level learning, and grounds measures in social justice.</p>
  <p>Overall, the sectors prioritised for both mitigation and adaptation provide a pathway toward strengthening local knowledge systems and improving access to technical knowledge. Moreover, the sectors provide a means of expanding access to renewable energy by increasing access to renewable energy technologies and improving energy efficiency. Likewise, enhanced attention will be given to removing barriers to the adoption of low-carbon technologies in the transport, agriculture, and waste sectors, and limitations to the development and transfer of climate-resilient technologies. Similarly, proposed actions promise to encourage sustainable transport and urban development by shifting from traditional infrastructure to greener alternatives for urban mobility (such as mass transit systems), waste management, and fuel- efficient vehicles. Also, the NDC will enhance the commitment to managing land use, forests, as well as other land use changes to enhance carbon sequestration. These approaches will include targeted policy and institutional interventions that support implementation nationally and locally, including using innovative vehicles to meet financing needs, participatory methods for generating and disseminating knowledge, and deliberate actions to cultivate and foster partnerships.</p>
      <h1><a>1. INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
      <p>Sierra Leone submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC in September 2015, setting out its adaptation and mitigation goals. With the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in November 2016, the INDC became Sierra Leone’s first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC1). NDC1 was built upon the 2013 Green Growth and the country’s National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (NCCSAP), as well as other key national policies and guiding documents.</p>
      <p>Today’s NDC updates and strengthens NDC1 for both the mitigation and adaptation contributions, informed by improved data collection, in-depth technical analysis and extensive stakeholder engagement. In the case of mitigation, detailed sector- and project-based modelling has been undertaken to now estimate the country’s mitigation potential and develop quantified conditional and unconditional contributions until 2030.</p>
      <p>Approaches used to gather information included organising workshops across the country to consult on various aspects of the document and working with consultants to deliver specific work packages. These methods and procedures for data collection, analysis, and integration are presented in the next section.</p>
      <p>The document is divided into the following seven chapters.</p>
      <p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of the document, focusing on the relevant articles of the Paris Agreement and defining national circumstances that underlines the actions proposed in the NDC. It also gives an overview of NDC1 actions and the achievements to date.</p>
      <p>Chapter 2 describes the revision process, including documents reviewed, stakeholder consultations held, technical assessments are undertaken and validation of the current NDC.</p>
      <p>Chapter 3 reviews the national circumstances, covering the geographic, climatic, economic, and sociological issues that rationalize the steps put forward in this document for addressing climate change risks, vulnerabilities, and impacts.</p>
      <p>Chapter 4 presents the country’s vision for climate change, the strategies and actions that it reflects and builds upon, including various adaptation plans, the LECRDS, the NFCS, climate change policies and strategies, and commitments made at various climate negotiations.</p>
      <p>Chapter 5 presents contributions for mitigation, highlighting the main sources of emission, changes in emission levels since 2015, and actions for reducing emissions until 2030.</p>
      <p>Chapter 6 examines previous proposals for adaptation to identify achievements and gaps and delineate next steps. New actions proposed reflect on past commitments, lessons learned from various adaptation interventions, and opportunities for innovation and policy change;</p>
      <p>Chapter 7 brings the different strands of the document together by proposing strategies for implementation, including appropriate, sector-based, and gender-transformative plans for mobilising resources, meaningfully engaging the public to increase NDC visibility as well as community and policy learning, increasing social inclusion, influencing policy change, building capacity, and promoting monitoring, reporting, and verification. The chapter also describes the institutional arrangements and organisational structures for implementing the NDC.</p>
      <h1><a>2. NDC REVIEW PROCESS</a></h1>
      <p>Many reforms and developments took place since the submission of the INDC in 2015, which form an important basis for the revision of the NDC. These developments are presented in the table below.</p>

      <p>These developments provided insights for consultations held with sector experts in 2021 to determine costs for meeting conditional and unconditional targets for mitigation and adaptation until 2025 and 2030. The consultation process involved working with various stakeholders to review the progress made with implementing the INDC and identify gaps and actions for the future. The consultative workshops conducted in the different regions of the country, offered a format for bringing together stakeholders who are informed about or have a felt experience of climate change. Overall, the meetings and workshops held helped to problematize concerns about climate risks and propose pathways for adaptation and mitigation moving forward.</p>
      <h1><a>3. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</a></h1>
      <p>This section provides a brief overview of Sierra Leone’s national circumstances, including the country’s geography and polity, climate and climate change impacts, environment and natural resources, and social and economic characteristics.</p>
          <h2><a>3.1 Geography and polity</a></h2>
          <p>Sierra Leone is in the West of Africa and lies between latitudes 7 (6degree 55minute) and 10 (10degree 00minute) degrees North of the equator and longitude 10 (10-degree 14 minutes) and 13 (13-degree 17 minutes) degrees West of the Greenwich Meridian. It is bordered by Liberia to the southeast, Guinea to the northeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the West. The country is divided into four main physical regions, namely coastal plains, interior lowland plains, interior plateau, and hills and mountains.</p>
          <p>Sierra Leone is subdivided into five Administrative Regions: Northwest, North, South, East and Western and into sixteen (16) districts (see map). The country is richly endowed with natural resources, including forests, wildlife, fisheries, land, and minerals. There are 50 protected areas according to the UNEP WDPA database (UNEP 2015).The country is also globally acclaimed for its wildlife, including 147 known species of wild mammals, 172 known breeding bird species, 67 known reptile species, 35 known amphibian species, 750 species of butterflies including the giant African swallowtail, one of the largest butterflies, and about 200 known species of fish. Fisheries and other coastal and marine resources include small pelagic fish, tuna, billfish, shrimps and</p>

          <p>Figure 1: Administrative map of Sierra Leone (source: GoSL 2018)</p>
          <p>demersal fish resources, as well as migratory birds, threatened manatees, seals, monks, marine mammals, sea turtles, porpoises, sawfish and crocodiles. At the same time, minerals such as diamonds, titanium bauxite, gold and rutile, and the recently uncovered iron ore were major contributors to the country’s GDP growth between 2012 and 2015. Land is also widely available, although only 10 percent is cultivated for food crops such as rice, cassava, yams, and other root crops.</p>
          <p>The coastline, stretching 506km, is characterized by sandy beaches, cliffs, lagoons, estuaries, mudflats, creeks, bays, and mangrove swamps. It is located on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean and is made up of four distinct regions, also known as the Sierra Leone Coastal Landscape Complex (SLCLC): the Scarcies River Estuary (SRE), Sierra Leone River Estuary (SLRE), Bonthe-Sherbro River Estuary (BSRE), and Yawri Bay. The SRE hosts historically important localities such as Tombo, Tasso, Bunce Island, and the Queen Elizabeth II Quay (the largest natural harbour in West Africa). Generally, the SLCLC is characterised by sea mounts, large gulfs, offshore banks, shoals and islands, and upwelling. It also comprises the bays and estuaries of the Rokel, Great and Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Jong, Moa, Sewa, and Mano.</p>

          <p><a>Figure 2: Regions of the SLCLC (source: WABiCC 2018)</a></p>
          <p>The interior lowland plains, the largest of the four physical regions, extend from the coastal terraces in the west to the east of Sierra Leone, occupying approximately 43% of the total land area. They rise to elevations of 200m in the east where they are separated from the plateau by distinct escarpments. At the edge of the lowland plains is the interior plateau, which covers 22% of the total land area and is made up principally of granite. The plateau region seldom rises above 700m and is composed of alluvial ironstone gravel in the south-eastern region, while the northern end is composed of weathered outcrops of granitic rocks. The eastern and southern parts comprise dissected hills. In the north and east of the country are found two of the highest mountains. The highest peak on the Loma Mountains is Bintumani, which rises to 1945m while Sankan-Biriwa on the Tingi Hills, rises to 1805m. The Freetown peninsula is made up of dissected mountainous Peaks with Sugar Loaf and Picket Hills being the highest.</p>
          <h2><a>3.2 The local climate</a></h2>
          <p>Although the local climate can be classified as tropical monsoon, it could also be described as a transition between a permanent rainforest and a tropical savannah climate. The climate is characterized by two distinct seasons: the rainy season which runs from May to November, and a dry season from December to May. The average temperature is 26°C and varies from about 24°C to 28°C throughout the year. However, the daily maximum temperature can reach 35 °C while the daily minimum temperature is above 20 OC. The country's average annual temperature has increased by 0.8°C since 1960, an average rate of 0.18°C per decade (McSweeny et el 2010). Temperatures often remain below 30 °C (86 °F) during the day during the rainy season, and humidity makes the air quite stifling. Average annual rainfall ranges from 2300 mm to 3100 mm. Rainfall peaks from June to September when it exceeds the monthly average of 250 mm (10 in). It can often be torrential in coastal areas, especially in July and</p>
          <p>August. Monthly climatologies of precipitation and mean temperature between 1991 and 2020 for the regions are provided in Figures 3. For each region, the seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation is similar, but the distribution of monthly precipitation is location specific. The largest changes in precipitation occurred between July and August each year, with more precipitation recorded in the western province. At the same time, the greatest increase in temperature was observed between March and April, with the greatest increase occurring in the Northern Province (see fig.3 below).</p>

          <h2><a>3.3 Current and future impacts of climate change</a></h2>
              <p><a>3.3.1 Agriculture and Food Security</a></p>
              <p>Agriculture is an important livelihood, primary food source and large component of the economy. Current climatic conditions are ideal for the production of the primary crops: rice, sugar cane, banana, coconut, citrus, cocoa, pineapple, yam and cassava. With regional climate modelling projections demonstrating increased temperatures (approx. +1.7 °C for RCP4.5 and 2.3°C for RCP8.5) and rainfall changes from -5% to 5% with high variability, this is likely to change agriculture practices and production. For instance, rice being the staple food crop in Sierra Leone and being grown mainly in smallholder farming under rain-fed conditions, agriculture and farmers’ livelihoods are especially vulnerable to changes in precipitation. This is compounded by the persistent rural poverty and farmers without insurance or the resources to invest in irrigation and other agricultural technologies. These climate impacts are also likely to increase water requirements for crops, competition for water resources, as well as incidence of pest and disease outbreaks.</p>
              <p><a>Table 2: Projected precipitation and temperature changes in Sierra Leone</a></p>
              <p><img width="604" height="73" alt="image" src="img/SLE-NDC1-6.png"></p>
              <p>The extreme events are expected to increase in the future. For instance, RCMs projection for RCP4.5 and RPC8.5 has shown a significant positive trend of warm spell days and high rainfall events (Fig. 4). The increased occurrence of warm spells is going to increase crop water requirement and therefore play a key role in crop and livestock production by reducing water availability in water limited areas. With the expected increase of height rainfall event, which will potentially lead to flooding, rain fed agriculture is at risk of crop and livestock losses and could significantly affect food security.</p>
              <p><img width="603" height="421" alt="image" src="img/SLE-NDC1-7.png"></p>
              <p><a>Figure 4: 90th percentile rainfall (top) and Warm spell day (bottom) trend in Sierra Leone</a></p>
              <p><a>3.3.2 Water Resources and Energy</a></p>
              <p>Water quality and availability are highly vulnerable to climate impacts. Major water uses include domestic (drinking, cooking, hygiene), agriculture (irrigation), industrial (beer, spirits, soft drink, cooling and waste disposal), and hydroelectric power production. Additionally, rural migration to Freetown, during and since the civil conflict has increased pressure on urban water resources. Reliable and clean access water is essential for these multiple uses and populations with implications for social vulnerability and poverty.</p>
              <p>Shifting rainfall patterns has created water and energy supply problems (Fig. 5 and 6). This has led to decreasing access to water and reduced stream flow of rivers and streams, as well as lower supply of energy to meet cooling, lighting, and heating needs. Stream flow has decreased as there has been a decrease in rainfall since the 1970s. For example, the stream flow to the Mano River fell by 30% between 1971 and 1989. This has large impacts on access to water since about 80% of the rural population receives water from surface sources, including many streams and ponds. These streams also dry up during severe droughts which are likely to become more common. There is also seasonal variation where 40% of the protected water points suffer water shortages in the dry season (USAID 2016), demonstrating that existing vulnerability is already acute.</p>

              <p><a>3.3.3 Fisheries and the coastal zone</a></p>
              <p>Climate change is having impacts on coastal communities, fisheries, and coastal environments which are important ecosystems and support livelihoods including tourism. Decreasing river flows, rising salinity of estuaries, loss of fish and aquatic plant species and reduction in coastal sediments are likely to damage coastal economies and the food security for coastal and riverside populations. With sea level rise, loss of coastal ecosystems inundation from major rivers, flash floods during the rainy season and saline intrusions due to decreased low water flows in the dry season, there are increasing challenges to livelihoods. Coastal erosion is already a significant challenge in some coastal areas in Sierra Leone (such as Konakridee, Lakka, Hamilton and Plantain Island) where the coastline is shifting by about 4 to 6 meters a year (WA BiCC 2019). Sea level rise has the effect of augmenting a decrease in the quality and quantity of ground water resources otherwise caused by human activities.</p>
              <p><a>3.3.4 Infrastructure</a></p>
              <p>Infrastructure in Sierra Leone is vulnerable to climate impacts across the country. This is especially true as the current infrastructure is non-existent or poor due to the war and deferred maintenance. Roads are the primary mode of transport with limited or non-existent rail. River transport systems are often impassable during the current rainy season. The coast, which will be impacted by sea level rise, beach erosion and coastal flooding, is densely populated and is an important economic centre with ports and tourist facilities. Coastal communities such as Kroobay, Moa Wharf lack flood escape routes due to the low elevation of roads. Other roads also flood during the rainy season. This makes it difficult for farmers to transport their agricultural goods. Additionally, as future infrastructure investment occurs construction materials and design should be climate sensitive and consider heat stress and flood risk.</p>
              <p>Water and sanitation infrastructure are sensitive to storm surge, sea level rise and flooding. Already a large percentage of the population lack access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Wastewater collection and treatment facilities are often situated at the lowest point possible as their operation often depends on gravity flow and can easily be inundated by water level rise. Therefore, climate-sensitive innovative designs of sanitation infrastructure are critical in adapting to climate change.</p>
              <p><a>3.3.5 Health</a></p>
              <p>Sierra Leone has one of the highest malnutrition and child mortality rates in the world, making the country’s population extremely vulnerable to climate shocks. Incidents of high temperature morbidity and mortality are projected to increase as the climate change projections revealed a significant positive trend in warm periods and a 5 to 10% increase in warm nights over the period 2021-2080 (Figure 4 and 7). Increased temperatures are also associated with increased episodes of diarrheal diseases, seafood poisoning, and increases in dangerous pollutants. Waterborne diseases are also expected to increase with more frequent and intense flooding. Currently the heavy rains have increased the likelihood of the outbreak of communicable diseases. More intense dry seasons (with increased temperatures) in the north and west have been linked to reduced water quality, warm spells, and disease outbreaks. Warmer seas contribute to toxic algae bloom and increased cases and food poisoning from consumption of shellfish and reef fish. The Ebola outbreak revealed a deficient health system, including understaffed, unavailable or unaffordable health care that will be further stressed by climate change impacts (USAID 2016).</p>
              <p><a>3.3.6 Environment</a></p>
              <p>Ecosystems will be severely impacted by climate change and existing development stressors. With increased storm surges, flash floods, and high winds, these conditions will be exacerbated by pollution, landslides, coastal erosion, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and invasive species which will further stress ecosystems. Land cover is expected to change. 60% of the country will be under tropical dry forest, 24% under tropical very dry forest, and 12% cover under sub- tropical moist forest particularly in the south and east of the country. This is the reverse of the current situation and indicates a northward shift in the vegetation i.e. from tropical rain forest to tropical dry forest. This will change the flora and fauna of these areas. The major challenges of forest management include, amongst others, poor governance, weak law enforcement, lack</p>
              <p>of coordination among sector ministries and illegal harvesting. Deforestation also increases both landslides and floods, by removing tree roots that stabilize the ground.</p>
              <p><a>3.3.7 Disaster Management</a></p>
              <p>Sierra Leone is vulnerable to the increasing severity of droughts, floods and severe storms and their impacts on sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, as well as infrastructure and hydroelectric power production. Urban and rural seasonal flooding, recurrent flash flooding, and coastal flooding are the most commonly observed, leading to seasonal flooding of agricultural fields and low-lying areas, flooding along the coast areas and flood waters overflowing into roads and into residents’ homes. Vulnerable areas include Western Area, Eastern, Southern and Northern regions. More specifically, the most affected areas in the recent past during these last years include: Kroo Bay, Susan’s Bay, Granville Brook, Lumley area in Western Area, Port Loko and Kambia Districts, the Newton catchment area, Pujehun and Bo areas, Kenema and Moyamba Districts, and coastal beaches of the Western Area Peninsula (Government of Sierra Leone 2018). There are also transboundary issues as heavy rainfall in neighbouring countries may cause floods in Sierra Leone due to the overflowing of three rivers: Great Scarcies and Little Scarcies rivers from Guinea and Mano from Liberia (World Bank 2017). There are also cascading impacts from flooding. Many communities in Sierra Leone, especially the rural poor, depend on streams and swamps, which dry up during severe droughts. Floods overwhelm existing systems, contaminating drinking water and creating sewage overflows.</p>

              <p>The key natural resources in Sierra Leone include land, water, forests, fisheries, wildlife, and minerals.</p>
                  <h3><a>3.3.8.1 Land</a></h3>
                  <p><img width="354" height="319" alt="Map Description automatically generated" src="img/SLE-NDC1-12.png"></p>
                  <p>The land cover is approximately 72,300 sq. km, 74% of which is cultivable. The upland areas, which represent 80% of all arable land, have low fertility but are suitable for cultivating a wide variety of food and cash crops. The lowlands, which make up the rest of the arable land area, are more fertile and are suitable for high productivity under sustainable management conditions. These comprise 690,000ha of inland valley swamps, 145,000ha of bolilands, 130,000ha of grassland, and 20,000ha of mangrove swamps (Sannoh 2015 cited in Martiny, Massaquoi, and Blackwell 2021). A 2017 UNCCD-funded research on</p>

                  <p>organic carbon- shows that between 2000 and 2015, there was an increase in forestland conversion to cropland and an overall reduction in tree-cover by 26.9% and water bodies by 0.7% (see fig. 13 adapted from Massaquoi 2018). This explains the increase in degraded land areas across the country, now identified and mapped as hotspots by the UNCCD target setting report (see fig. 14 adapted GoSL 2018).</p>
                  <h3><a>3.3.8.2 Water</a></h3>
                  <p>Water resources include atmospheric (treated under the Climate sub-section above), surface and groundwater. Sierra Leone has nine major river systems. The Rokel/Seli, Pampana/Jong, Sewa and Waanje systems originate from within the country, as do the numerous coastal streams and creeks; the Great and Little Scarcies and Moa Rivers originate from the Fouta Djallon Plateau in the Republic of Guinea, and the Mano River originates from the Republic of Liberia. These rivers range in length from 160 km for the Great Scarcies to 430 km for the Sewa River; their catchment areas range from 2,530 km2 for the coastal streams and creeks, to 14,140 km2 for the Sewa River. The total mean annual runoff from the river basins is of the order of 160 km3, with monthly runoff following rainfall variability. Internally, renewable water resources are over 29,000 km3 per capita, which is six times the average for Africa. Produced groundwater is estimated at 50 km3 annually and much of this (80%) overlaps between surface and ground water.</p>

                  <h3><a>3.3.8.3 Forests</a></h3>
                  <p>An estimated 39% of Sierra Leone is forested with twenty-two percent of the forests in50 forest reserves and conservation areas (UNEP, 2015); 1% is on chiefdom land but managed by the Forest Division; and 23% are within a wetland and marine ecosystem protected areas (ARD 2010). The 50 forest reserves are under the custody of the State occupying approximately 285,000 hectares of total land cover. In addition, there are 300,000 hectares of mangrove forests and 30,000 hectares of constituted community forests. In 2017, Sierra Leone revised its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) to assess the status of biodiversity, including forest resources, and propose action plans for sustainable management.</p>

                  <p>Analysis of the land use data by CILSS highlights the most significant land cover changes in Sierra Leone, including the loss of woodland and forest areas across the country. The primary forest losses occurred in Tonkolili, Kono, and Koinadugu districts. Sierra Leone has lost over 34% of its forests between 1975 and 2018. This forest degradation is most noticeable in the eastern region. Most of the forested areas have been degraded to savannahs and agricultural land. The expansion of cultivated land, slash-and-burn agriculture and logging have been the dominant factors explaining forest loss. As for agricultural areas, they have increased by 76.57% between 1975 and 2018 with a strong expansion from 2000 (Fig.10).</p>

                  <h3><a>3.3.8.4 Fisheries</a></h3>
                  <p>Sierra Leone is blessed with abundant and varied fish resources. Fisheries activities currently contribute about 10% of GDP, and fish is a major source of animal protein for over 80% of the country’s population. In addition, the sector currently employs over 500,000 Sierra Leoneans, with women at the forefront of many activities (particularly fish processing and marketing). The production of industrial fisheries has been around 20,000 tonnes, mainly exported with little or no value addition. The semi-industrial fisheries base, if upgraded, could significantly increase production levels. Artisanal fish production currently stands at around 120,000 tonnes, mainly for the local market with little or no value addition. It is estimated that wide-scale improvement of fisheries activities has the potential to bring the sector’s employment levels close to one million people and revenue earning potential of $60 million annually. Therefore, this sector has the potential for rapid and inclusive growth, as well as positive spill-over for food security and poverty reduction objectives.</p>
                  <h3><a>3.3.8.5 Wildlife</a></h3>
                  <p>Furthermore, there are approximately 147 known species of wild mammals, 172 known breeding bird species, 67 known reptile species, 35 known amphibian species, 750 species of butterflies including the giant African swallowtail, one of the largest butterflies, and about 200 known species of fish. In 2010, more than 5500 Chimpanzees were found, double the number previously thought to live in the country. This is the second largest population of the endangered subspecies of western chimpanzee, after Guinea, with the largest density in the Loma area, 2.69 individuals per sq. km, and the Outamba-Kilimi, with 1.21 individuals per sq. km. Several species of whales and the African manatee can also be found in the country, along with 630 known species of birds, ten of which are considered endangered, including the rufous fishing-owl and the Gola malimbe. There are 67 known species of reptiles, three of which are endangered: the Nile crocodile, the slender-snouted crocodile which lives in forest streams, and the dwarf crocodile found in mangrove swamps. All the species of sea turtles can be found in the waters of Sierra Leone and both the green turtle and leatherback turtle routinely nest on the Sherbro and Turtle Islands These species are under some form of protection in coastal and terrestrial ecosystems by the Government of Sierra Leone (based on review in Martiny, Massaquoi, and Blackwell 2021).</p>
          <h2><a>3.4 Socio-economic characteristics</a></h2>
          <p>Sierra Leone has had an unstable modern history marked by a civil war from 1991-2002 and the two-year Ebola crisis (2014-2016). These events and political instability have led to severe socio-economic repercussions and contributed to the underlying vulnerabilities which persists today. The country is one of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa and globally, with a GDP per capita of US$499 in 2017. It ranked 182 out of 188 countries on the United Nations 2020 Human Development Index, below the average for countries with similar GDP per capita (UNDP 2020a). The overall poverty rate in Sierra Leone is 57 percent, with 10.8 percent of the population living in extreme poverty (Government of Sierra Leone 2019). The Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA 2015- MAFFS/WFP/FAO) reported that 49% (3,475,135.37) of people in Sierra Leone are food insecure, of which the majority are poor smallholder farmers that are living in the rural areas of the country (Government of Sierra Leone 2018).</p>
          <p>The population is around 7.4 million (2018). The population growth rate has increased rapidly from 1.8 percent between 1985 and 2004 to 3.2 percent between 2004 and 2015. This has led to a 40 percent increase from about 5 million in 2004 to more than 7 million today. At the current rate, the population will reach 10 million people by 2026 (Government of Sierra Leone 2019). Forty percent of Sierra Leone’s population are youth. There is high unemployment among low and semi-skilled youth most of whom were unable to complete their education due to the civil war. These challenges have been exacerbated by two recent economic shocks, the Ebola epidemic and the collapse of iron ore commodity prices, which lead to shrinking GDP growth. Since then, economic growth has fluctuated. Real GDP growth was weak in 2018 at 3.5% but improved slightly to an estimated 5.0% in 2019, driven by agriculture and services, and in the first half of 2019 by extractives (African Development Bank 2019).</p>
          <p>Sierra Leone is especially vulnerable to external shocks. The country does not have any control over the price of its major imported goods, such as rice and fuel, which account for over 50 percent of total import value. Additionally, its dependence on primary commodity exports makes it more vulnerable. The African Development Bank projects that international iron ore prices will drop from $77.70 per dry metric ton in 2019 to $72.40 in 2022, which is more evidence for the need for economic diversification away from extractive industries (African Development Bank 2019). Covid-19 has added additional shocks and GDP growth is expected to fall to 1.7%. This is primarily due to the decline in commodity prices and depressed trade, FDI inflows, tourism revenue following travel restrictions and declines in remittances. An analysis by the African Development Bank projects inflation to reach between 15.3% and 17% (African Development Bank Group 2020).</p>
          <p>Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food security, poverty reduction and improving public health. Agriculture employs more than half of the country’s formal and informal workforce and accounts for about half of GDP and is a women dominated sector (Government of Sierra Leone 2019). Although 75 percent of its land is arable, only about 10 percent is cultivated, mainly for food crops such as rice, cassava, yams, and other root crops (Government of Sierra Leone 2018). Farmers, however, have limited access to improved varieties of seeds, equipment and fertilizers. Additionally, farming is mostly rainfed, making it more vulnerable to climate impacts (Government of Sierra Leone 2018). Fisheries activities currently contribute about 10% of GDP, is a primary livelihood for 500,000 people and a main source of animal protein for over 80% of the population. Additionally, fish processing and marketing is a sector led primarily by women, similar to agriculture, making women’s work more climate sensitive (Government of Sierra Leone 2018).</p>
                <h2><a>3.5 Urbanization and infrastructure</a></h2>
                <p>Sierra Leone ranked 46 out of 54 countries on the bank’s Africa Infrastructure Development Index in 2020 (AfDB 2020). This points to the significant infrastructure investment needed across all sectors including water and sanitation, health, energy, transport, and ICT. The poor infrastructural landscape in Sierra Leone has had a tremendously negative impact on economic diversification, health and livelihoods. Infrastructure is a centrepiece of the Medium-Term Development Plan and key to Sierra Leone’s long-term development goals of becoming a middle-income country.</p>
                <p>Access to affordable and reliable electricity is essential for human development. Currently, this is severely limited in the country. Biomass from wood and charcoal is the source of energy for 80% of the population with related significant environmental and public health impacts such as deforestation and respiratory illnesses. As Sierra Leone addresses its climate goals in an integrated way, renewable and reliable energy sources are an essential component.</p>
                <p>Many of the major causes of death and disability in Sierra Leone can be traced to challenges with environmental health and sanitation. Most of the country’s population obtain water from unsafe open water sources and waterborne diseases are very common. There is also a dearth of sanitation facilities and almost 30% of the rural population practices open defecation. Sanitation is far below the reasonable SDG target of 66% for the country and the budget allocation for the sector is less than .02 percent of GDP (Government of Sierra Leone 2019).</p>
                <p>Infrastructure issues are compounded as more people move into urban centres. In Sierra Leone, urbanization has been accelerating since the civil war. The share of the population living in urban areas almost doubled from 21% in 1967 to almost 40% in 2015, with a high concentration in the capital Freetown, which has grown to a population of more than 1 million. This growth is now rapidly increasing. From 2004 to 2015 the population has increased 43% from approximately 5 million to approximately 7 million (Statistics Sierra Leone 2016). Urbanization has not been accompanied by sufficient resources to plan and manage this fast growth and cities have lacked the financing to make the necessary investments to cope with the accelerated demand for infrastructure and services. This has climate risk implications as this can increase vulnerability for an already vulnerable population especially those in informal settlements or working in the informal sector.</p>
                <h2><a>3.6 Waste</a></h2>
                <p>Sierra Leone has a paradigm shift of increase in rural urban migration in search of better opportunities and basic social amenities. This increase has resulted in a significant increase in waste generation and high demand in public services including solid waste management services. The waste sector is branded by improper waste management. Urban expansion across the country has exacerbated the problems of waste, sanitation, and drain flows.</p>
                <p>Freetown the capital of Sierra Leone has a population of around 1.2 million, and a waste generation per capita per day of 0.5 kg, at least 600 metric tons of waste could be generated per day or 219,000 metric ton of waste annually ( Ngeba A. and Bertin, 2020). The increasing population in cities and towns in Sierra Leone is quite likely to increase the amount and diversity of wastes and subsequently the relative quantum of emissions of GHG from the sector, especially methane (CH4) from dump sites, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and precursor gases (NOx, CO).</p>
                <p>Wastewater treatment is a source of NO2 or N2O. Where significant industrial activity exists in a country, such a sector makes a significant contribution to the total nitrous-oxide emission. In the case of Sierra Leone, few industries or factories exist. The few industries in the country mostly in Freetown simply discharge 160 their wastewater into the general drainage system and this eventually runs down into the Sierra Leone River Estuary. This component of waste was therefore not regarded as a significant source of NO2 or N2O.</p>
                <h2><a>3.7 Gender and Social Inclusion Issues</a></h2>
          <p>Women are 51% of the population and suffer from gender inequality and discrimination. Sierra Leone historically stands in the bottom ten of the Gender Development Index (UNDP 2020b). Inequalities are apparent in terms of literacy rates, per capita GDP, access to land, and legal protection. Increased poverty among women in Sierra Leone results from a combination of factors, which include limited skills and knowledge; unfriendly market structures that concentrate women in lower paying and time-consuming work and restrict their access to capital and credit; traditional family structures perpetuating gender inequality through patriarchal norms of property ownership and inheritance; discrimination in the public domain; weak and unequal trade and economic patterns (USAID, 2019).</p>
          <p>Over the past decade, the government has developed and enacted a range of national laws, policies, and strategies to address gender inequality. This included the passage of the three ‘gender justice’ laws’, which respectively address domestic violence, improve women’s access to land through inheritance, and strengthen women’s rights in marriage and divorce through a</p>
          <p>registration process. Several government entities have also been established to support gender equality including the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs; the Human Rights Commission; the Family Support Unit in the Sierra Leone Police; and the Legal Aid Board. This institutional development, however, has been insufficient. For example, women occupy less than 20 percent of elected positions although the Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Bill, which establishes a minimum of 30 percent representation of women in governance at all levels. The Medium-Term Development Plan seeks to address this issue and includes empowering women as a key focus including to support implementation of current legislation.</p>
      <h1><a>4. SIERRA LEONE’S VISION FOR CLIMATE CHANGE</a></h1>
      <p>Sierra Leone recognises the importance and emergency of combating climate change, which poses a major global threat and a common concern of humankind, as rising temperatures increasingly result in severe, pervasive and irreversible negative impacts for people, economic activities, ecosystems and the regenerative capacity of the planet.</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone is strongly committed to contribute to the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, in the light of its national circumstances.</p>
      <p>As a least developing, very low emitting but also very vulnerable country, Sierra Leone’s vision for fighting against climate change in the context of this revised first NDC is based on fairness, putting a strong emphasis on adaptation in order to protect its people, culture and environment while striving its best efforts to contribute to the mitigation of global emissions.</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone’s vision for adaptation is drawn from the iNAP, with the objective to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability by half by 2030 through increased risk awareness, improvements in rule compliance, increased institutional capacity and an integrated approach to adaptation in development policy and programs across sectors and scales. The above visions support proposals in the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP), which was revised in early 2021.</p>
      <p>It also expands on the goals set for adaptation in the iNAP, which include increasing resilience capacity at all scales; supporting an integrative approach to climate change adaptation programming and policymaking; allocating 10% of annual national budgets to climate change adaptation across sectors; harmonizing climate-relevant policies and regulations to improve coordination and cross-sector linkages; mainstreaming adaptation into local development plans by 2025; institutionalize NAP implementation through laws, policies, and regulations; establishing a National Trust Fund for channelling adaptation support across sectors; and securing 40% of international development funding to support adaptation priorities across different sectors.</p>
      <p>These national goals contribute to achieving the Global Goal on adaptation by reducing vulnerability through integrating adaptation considerations into all relevant plans, policies, and strategies, and prioritizing and planning for adaptation. They also ensure that the adaptation component of the NDC becomes a strategic and ambitious vehicle for capturing, reporting and updating commitments and progress, as well as aligning long-term national development priorities with the SDG framework<i>.</i> Moreover, the goals contribute to improving the delivery of climate services as prescribed in the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS). The NFCS will benefit a wide range of sectors and climate intervention areas, including biodiversity, health, energy, agriculture, human settlements, water etc. By implementing the NDC, key actors, including SLMet, can produce sector-specific products to enable informed decision-making in the context of the effective, efficient and equitable delivery of climate services.</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone’s vision on mitigation is drawn on the LECRDS, with the objective to achieve GHG emission reductions in priority sectors through well targeted programmes of activities and projects, including through the implementation of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programmes, which can deliver significant mitigation and adaptation co-benefits in Sierra Leone.</p>
      <p>Most importantly Sierra Leone’s vision for fighting against climate change through the implementation of both mitigation and adaptation components of the revised NDC is embedded in the Medium-Term National Development Plan, specifically in its Clusters 2, 3, 5 and 7 which are aligned to it. Therefore, the revised NDC will contribute directly to meeting various climate and non-climate objectives at the national level in a consistent and well-coordinated manner.</p>
      <p>Considering the nature and extent of Sierra Leone’s climate impacts and low adaptive capacity, the commitments made in this NDC are fair and ambitious, and are based on conditions of equity, availability of finance, and the potential for achieving SDGs and other regional climate goals. The conditions are ambitious in relation to the global limit of 1.5°C and present a significant enhancement from the previous NDC1 by adding new sectors, strategies, and policies (enhanced mitigation and adaptation components). Overall, the measures are considered transparent as they are presented by sector and defined through extensive consultations with stakeholders at all levels and from different backgrounds.</p>
            <h2><a>4.1 Priority Sectors</a></h2>
            <p>The priority sectors for the NDC are identified based on an analysis of national priorities contained in various climate change documents, as well as prescriptions by the UNFCCC for NDC development. For mitigation, the priority sectors include energy; industrial processes and product use; waste; Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses (AFOLU); and the blue economy, while for adaptation, the priority sectors are Agriculture and Food Security, Water Resources and Energy, Coastal Zone Management (including fisheries, coastal ecosystems etc.), Environment (including tourism, land, mineral resources, forestry, etc.), Disaster management, Gender and Social Inclusion (focusing on youth, women, elderly, persons with disabilities), and hard and soft infrastructure (including for transportation, WASH, etc). Although mitigation and adaptation measures are handled separately in this document, due to differences in priorities for the measures and segregated planning and implementation policies at international and national levels, a few synergistic approaches for implementation are proposed based on the benefits they could bring at multiple scales and in multiple sectors.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.1 Energy</a></h2>
                <p>Priorities for energy focus on reducing emissions from power plants and other energy fossil fuel-based sources. They are based on efforts in the sector to increase universal energy access through the deployment of renewable energy technologies and increased efficiency of energy sources. Generally, the sector could contribute immensely to emissions reduction through the implementation of the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) developed by the MCCU and the offgrid solar energy strategy developed by the Foresign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO). Both documents complement actions in the sector to promote universal access to clean energy by 2030 and meet targets for emissions reduction by 2025.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.2 Industrial process and product use</a></h2>
                <p>Priorities for industry focus on actions to reduce emissions from local industry and the use of various products. They are based on efforts across multiple public and private sectors to improve process and product use and enforce extended producer responsibility while reducing emissions that endanger air quality and engender persistent air pollution. The selection of mitigation options for this sector is also based on national plans to implement the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the Ozone Layer, as well as Environmental Management Plans (EMP) adopted by various producers in compliance with the Environment Protection Agency Act of 2008 (Amended in 2010).</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.3 Waste</a></h2>
                <p>Priorities identified for waste management reflect efforts in various sectors to effectively manage waste from agricultural, healthcare, and other practices and sources. The priorities build upon national plans for managing animal waste, general solid waste, and other hazardous substances that endanger health and ecosystem vitality.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.4 Agriculture. Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Sectors</a></h2>
                <p>AFOLU cuts across sectors that contribute to land use change and land cover change for various outcomes. It focuses on the carbon impacts of forest loss, mining, and traditional agricultural practices such as slash and burn and the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. It also focuses on the net carbon gain of large-scale agro-investment land leases across the country, such as monoculture oil palm and sugarcane plantations run by SOCFIN and Sunbird Energy respectively. Efforts to reclaim mined-out areas, or the general impacts of mining on forest carbon sequestration and soil carbon is also addressed.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.5 Blue Economy</a></h2>
                <p>As a priority for climate change mitigation, the blue economy in Sierra Leone incorporates traditional maritime industries such as fisheries, tourism, mining, boat building, aquaculture systems, and carbon stored in mangrove and seagrass ecosystems. The fisheries sector for instance is a major source of jobs and a key driver of mangrove deforestation in coastal communities in Sierra Leone, which can have a major impact on the country’s blue carbon stock. These analyses inform an understanding of the current change in the country’s blue carbon stock, including losses or gains overtime in mangrove and seagrass resources.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.6 Agriculture and Food Security</a></h2>
                <p>Agriculture and food security are prioritised for adaptation because climate change is already having a toll on agricultural food systems in the country, including exporters and importers as well as those at subsistence level. In the future, changes in mean rainfall and temperature as well as the increase in extreme events will affect agriculture and livestock practices. At the same time, many impacts, such as increased land degradation and soil erosion, changes in water availability, more frequent and more intense pest and disease outbreaks as well as disasters need to be addressed to reduce food security risks.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.7 Water Resources and Energy</a></h2>
                <p>The water sector is prioritised for adaptation because future strategies will need to address many emerging trends driven by climate change. These include both demand and supply side concerns, including reduced availability, quality, and allocative efficiency. The energy sector is also a priority because the impacts of climate change will mostly affect the resource base of renewable energy sources through changes in water availability for hydropower, impacts on thermal power plants and energy infrastructure.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.8 Coastal Zone Management (including fisheries, coastal ecosystems etc.),</a></h2>
                <p>The coastal zone and the resources they provide are priorities for adaptation because climate change will impact the health, function and productivity of coastal ecosystems, thus impacting the health and welfare of coastal communities and the people that depend on these natural resources. Climate change will have significant and immediate consequences for the country’s coasts, the goods and services provided by coastal ecosystems, and coastal inhabitants. This includes accelerated coastal erosion and loss of land and property, flooding, saltwater intrusion, shifts in the distribution and abundance of valuable marine habitats, species and biodiversity, and the accelerated spread of exotic and invasive species.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.9 Environment (including tourism, land, mineral resources, forestry, etc.)</a></h2>
                <p>Tourism is prioritised for adaptation to reduce the business risks of tourism companies and protect their natural capital (such as beaches, rainforests, and biodiversity) and ecosystem services (water supply, protection against floods, landslides, etc.). The land and forestry sectors also lie at the heart of ongoing efforts to protect ecosystem integrity and promote the livelihoods and resilience of the poor and vulnerable. The mining sector is also a priority because threats to the sector’s profitability and viability, such as climate change, may have significant consequences for development in the country and undermine resilience in various communities.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.10 Disaster management</a></h2>
                <p>Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation represent policy goals for the government of Sierra Leone, one concerned with an ongoing problem (disasters) and the other with an emerging issue (climate change). As these problems overlap a great deal through the common factor of weather and climate and the similar tools used to monitor, analyse and address adverse consequences, disaster management is prioritised in this NDC to allow for approaching the twin issues of climate change and disaster risk reduction in a systematic and integrated way.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.11 Gender and Social Inclusion</a></h2>
                <p>Gender is a cross-cutting concern for adaptation planning because women and girls are subject to a disproportionate amount of risk from climate-related natural disasters. Risks during and following natural disasters are often higher for women, girls, and persons with disability due to social norms, breakdowns in law and order, and disrupted livelihoods. Women, girls and persons with disability also bear the brunt of risks and vulnerabilities brought on by droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, which places them at the front lines of adaptation as important and necessary stakeholders in effective adaptation to climate change. The NDC considers gender- transformative and socially inclusive strategies that will empower women, girls and persons with disability, reduce gender inequality, and improve adaptation and resilience outcomes.</p>
                <h2><a>4.1.12 Hard and Soft Infrastructure</a></h2>
      <p>Infrastructure, whether hard or soft, is a priority here because such networks will be affected by the physical impacts of climate variability and change but will also play an essential role in building resilience to those impacts. The strategies proposed will ensure that infrastructure is climate resilient to reduce direct losses and reduce the indirect costs of disruption. New infrastructure assets will also be prioritised, planned, designed, built and operated to account for the climate changes that may occur overtime. Existing infrastructure will also be retrofitted, or managed differently, because of climate change.</p>
      <h1><a>5. MITIGATION CONTRIBUTION</a></h1>
          <h2><a>5.1 Overview</a></h2>
          <p>In order to contribute to the mitigation of global GHG emissions, Sierra Leone’s commitment is to reduce its domestic GHG emissions of 10% by 2030 as compared to a no-policy scenario of 2015 to 2030, with an intermediary indicative mitigation target of 5% reduction by 2025 against the same baseline. In the longer term, Sierra Leone’s mitigation ambition is to cut GHG emission by 25% in 2050 with the inclusion of additional sectors and gases in the successive NDCs with clear and measurable mitigation targets and specific actions. Depending on available financial support, Sierra Leone is committed to enhance its mitigation efforts beyond in accordance with the progression principle enshrined in Article 4.3 of the Paris Agreement in the light of its national circumstances.</p>

          <h2><a>5.2 National GHG Inventory</a></h2>
          <p>The Third National Communication (TNC) revealed that Energy generation contributed largely (99%) to the GHG emission for 2005 (about 20340.20 Gg of CO2) in Sierra Leone. The increasing use of domestic individual diesel generators due to the lack of a well-functioning national grid system for electricity could explain this excessive consumption of fuel. The projection of CO2 emissions by fuel type is presented in table 4. The second highest contributor to GHG emissions in the country is waste, emitting 151.68Gg of CO2 specifically from landfills. Industrial processes contribute modestly (0.01955Gg CO2) to GHG emissions with cement production as the main source. The overall CO2 emission is projected to increase by 5% and 6% by 2025 and 2030 respectively from the baseline 2015.</p>

          <p>The above projections will be reviewed by the Fourth National Communications, which will be developed in 2023. It will offer stakeholders in the country an opportunity to further contribute to designing and implementing mitigation measures based on technically sound assessments. The process will involve GHG inventory preparation, mitigation options analysis, and forward planning to ensure key considerations are integrated into relevant social, economic, and environmental policies and actions.</p>
          <h2><a>5.3 Mitigation strategy</a></h2>
          <p>The strategy for implementing mitigation measures is made up of three main required components: mitigation goals, mitigation actions, and an action plan for implementation. These provide a framework to identify, prioritize and implement actions to reduce climate risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
          <p>The mitigation strategy fully takes account of gaps and achievements made with the implementation of mitigation measures since 2015, when the INDC of Sierra Leone was elaborated before COP21 to the UNFCCC where the Paris Agreement has been adopted.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Most of the strategies lacked concrete actions and targets, linked partly to a lack of institutional capacity. This is gradually changing with the growing appetite for climate mitigation by both public and private entities;</p>

      <h1><a>6. ADAPTATION CONTRIBUTION</a></h1>
          <h2><a>6.1 Overview</a></h2>
          <p>Sierra Leone is vulnerable to various climate risks. For instance, sea level rise threatens low- lying coastal Sierra Leone, especially the communities of Kroo Bay and Moa Wharf. There have been reports of increased coastal flood events, coastal erosion, and reduction in freshwater quality, population displacement, loss of property, reduction in groundwater resources, and reduced agricultural potential for coastal areas. Impacts of climate change on human health with an increase in the likelihood of certain diseases such as cholera, as well as the toll certain events take on agricultural production, infrastructure, tourism, public health and biodiversity, have also been documented (see for example, ref 1, ref2). Moreover, climate change is now recognized to have a significant impact on disaster risk reduction efforts and pose a considerable threat to efforts to meet the evolving needs of vulnerable communities</p>
          <p>In these circumstances, it is imperative to reduce the impacts of climate change. Some priorities include improving health delivery services, improving supply of safe drinking water and sanitation, increasing funding to the health sector, development of an early warning systems, strengthening meteorological and hydrological institutions, providing coastal infrastructure, improving sanitation, among other actions. Key priorities will be drawn from the iNAP, which reflects goals set for adaptation in various plans and strategies. As such, the INAP provides a key resource for implementing the adaptation actions outlined in this NDC.</p>
          <h2><a>6.2 Adaptation planning</a></h2>
          <p>The goals, actions, and plan proposed for adaptation in this section provide a country-driven and comprehensive approach to planning and implementation across multiple sectors and at scale. The approach sets out the adaptation outcomes the country is aiming to achieve, as well as how they will be achieved through iterative planning, public engagement, GESI mainstreaming, and other processes required for effective adaptation. These actions will be reviewed as the knowledge of climate risks and vulnerabilities across sectors and communities increases, as well as when the needs and capacities of different stakeholders evolve. The following analysis shows the progress made with the implementation of adaptation measures since 2015 (see table 8).</p>

      <h1><a>7. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</a></h1>
      <p>The actions proposed in the preceding sections consider mitigation and adaptation complementary responses to climate change. The complementarity of actions is important because mitigation and adaptation responses interact with one another and reduce risks over different timescales. Through this approach, NDC implementation will contribute to nearly all the SDGs, as well as other local and international development indices (see section 7.5) . In general, the means of implementing the actions proposed above include sustainable financing, adequate and appropriate capacity, the adoption of new technologies, effective public and stakeholder engagement, GESI mainstreaming, policy influencing, and fit-for-purpose systems for governance. These factors are presented in the succeeding sections.</p>
          <h2><a>7.1 Financing</a></h2>
          <p>Finance is required for the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation actions proposed in this NDC. Various domestic and international vehicles will be explored for resource mobilisation, because international public financing sources like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) cannot provide all that is needed for a large-scale investment in addressing climate change. Accordingly, financing sources such as the private sector and domestic fiscal budgets will be explored, as described in Table 10 below.</p>

          <p>From these different sources, <strong>USD 2,764,000,000</strong> (Two Billion, Seven Hundred and Sixty Four Million US Dollars) could be mobilised to implement the actions proposed in this NDC. Compared to previous requests, this NDC requires enhanced international support in the form of finance, technology transfer, and technical assistance. As such, steps for improving access to public and private financing sources will be a high priority. For instance, a National Climate Financing Facility (NCFF) will be formed to set out an NDC Investment Plan (NIP), including a strategy for meeting the financing needs of the NDC. The CFF, housed within the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) at the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) will build specific institutional capacities to address relevant technical barriers to resource mobilisation, and create an enabling environment for private sector engagement. Further information on the governance of structures for resource mobilisation is described in section 7.8.</p>

          <h2><a>7.2 Capacity building and technology transfer</a></h2>
          <p>Capacity building and technology transfer are vital conditions for the successful implementation of the NDC under the Paris Agreement. In Sierra Leone, capacity building and technology transfer are perceived in view of the shortfalls in past initiatives on capacity building under different bilateral and multilateral agencies, which can be largely attributed to their short-term, ad-hoc, supply-driven, and project-based nature. Overall, despite the progress made with capacity building related to climate action at the national level over the years, there are institutional, technical, and financial capacity gaps and needs with respect to the implementation of the adaptation and mitigation actions. Capacity gaps that have persisted include challenges to data generation, collection and analysis; governance and coordination; development of endogenous capacity; access to climate finance; monitoring and reporting; and gender-responsiveness. Potential capacity building and technology transfer actions in support of Adaptation (A) and Mitigation (M) efforts across the different sectors covered in this document are presented in Table 12.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Improve awareness and understanding of the Government of Sierra Leone’s climate change adaptation initiatives and the NAP process through effective communication, education and training</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Promote an inclusive and participatory approach to adapting to climate change so that the Government of Sierra Leone can unite under a common vision and speak with one voice on the issue of addressing climate change impacts</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Generate support and political commitment among key decision-makers for the NAP process and for prioritizing, managing and resourcing efforts to address climate change adaptation issues</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Persuade the general public and the private sector of the need for a significant and timely investment in climate change adaptation from both public and private sources within and outside of Sierra Leone</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Encourage Sierra Leoneans to collectively embark on activities to strengthen the country’s resilience to climate change</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
              <p>The strategy was developed as part of the NAP Global Network’s second programme of support to Sierra Leone with the aim of providing short- and mid-term guidance on how the government can use communications strategically and effectively to support the NAP process. It identifies a need for vertical integration, including by building political momentum at the subnational level; as well as strategic communications, including by enhancing strategic communications around climate change adaptation at the national and local levels. The strategy seeks to further emphasize the following aspects (EPA 2020):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>What information needs to be disseminated and when</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The key audience that the Government of Sierra Leone needs to address</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The relevant changes in knowledge, opinions or behaviour that need to be implemented</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The most effective messages and channels of communication to be used</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The sharing of communications-related responsibilities by different government actors to foster better internal coordination.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
              <p>The approach taken to public engagement is based on the following SWOT analyses:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Strengths,</strong> including that the climate change adaptation and mitigation information are readily available to the public; the government has several channels of communication at its disposal; the public is willing to change attitudes and behaviours if they receive the appropriate climate change education and communication; there is technical personnel with the capacity to implement climate change communication initiatives; and there is evidence of political will to support climate change adaptation and communication.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Weaknesses,</strong> including low public awareness about national climate change policies and legislation; inadequate access and usage of climate change data by decision makers; low budget allocation for climate change adaptation initiatives among MDAs; climate change issues are yet to form major parts of the government’s plans and budgets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Opportunities,</strong> including that there are funding opportunities to support capacity- building initiatives on climate change communication in Sierra Leone; and development partners are committed to supporting climate change-associated initiatives in the country, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Threats,</strong> including that most of the general public is still in denial about climate change; some politicians, religious and cultural leaders still miscomprehend facts about climate change; there is an excessive use of scientific terminology and technical information in communicating climate change; and there is limited positive change in behaviours, attitudes, perceptions and practices.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>A plan for public engagement is presented in table 13 below.</p>

          <h2><a>7.4 GESI mainstreaming</a></h2>
          <p>The governance and coordination mechanism for the NDC will foster the empowerment of women and marginalised people by ensuring meaningful participation in NDC implementation activities. Activities that create an enabling environment for women, youth, children, and persons with disability have been proposed, which will help to institutionalize GESI-sensitive approaches delivered at the technical and operational levels. Overall, NDC actions will promote a supportive institutional and policy environment for mainstreaming gender equality and social inclusion; mainstream GESI dimensions into the thematic and cross-cutting components of the NDC; enhance the capacity of partners and stakeholders to give women and marginalised groups a voice in climate management decision-making; and secure rights by increasing access to climate services and other socio-economic opportunities. The strategy for GESI mainstreaming is aligned with the Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Policy (GoSL 2020) and contributes to the implementation of the country’s vision for GESI in the Medium-Term National Development Plan (MTNDP).</p>
          <h2><a>7.5 Policy influencing</a></h2>
          <p>The NDC is aligned with several existing national and international policies, strategies, and plans, including the Medium-Term National Development Plan, AU Vision 2023, and the Sustainable Development Goals (see table 14). Therefore, it contributes to various country- level and regional actions to address climate change as part of global efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate emissions in countries. For instance, the governance and coordination mechanism for the NDC will support the delivery of SDGs, especially those on strong, accountable, and inclusive institutions (SDG16), strengthening means of implementation (SDG17), and creating more equitable governance systems (SDG4).</p>

          <h2>7.6 Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)</h2>
          <p>NDC actions will be tracked to meet local and international reporting requirements, including reports to policy makers and the public to improve transparency and shape decisions to update climate actions. The MRV framework proposed here builds upon sector-based systems for climate monitoring and reporting, as well as national approaches to MRV, including outputs of the CBIT (Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency) project “Building and Strengthening Sierra Leone’s National Capacity to Implement the Transparency Elements of the Paris Agreement, 2020-2023”.</p>
          <p>MRV actions will focus specifically on tracking mitigation (M), adaptation (A), and finance (F)- see table 15. For mitigation, the goal is to assess current and future progress in reducing GHGs by reviewing both the national inventory and national communications. This will involve regular M&amp;E actions to track the implementation of the mitigation component of the NDC to ensure actions are contributing to meeting targets set and providing lessons for future decision-making. In the case of adaptation, the goal is to track implementation and assess the effectiveness of actions, and as provide insights for updating NAPs. In terms of financing, MRV efforts will track climate finance flows for NDC implementation to improve transparency and determine if resource needs are being met.</p>

          <h2>7.7 Governance and coordination</h2>
          <p>NDC implementation will be overseen by the Ministry of the Environment with technical support provided by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and the Sierra Leone Meteorological Agency (SLMet). The process will be supported by different Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs). The governance and coordination will involve driving progress, engaging stakeholders within and outside of government, maintaining political will at all levels, and coordinating planning and decision-making processes. The existing mechanisms for NDC implementation, such as institutional structures prescribed by the NAP, NFCS, MTNDP, NCCP, CCS, and other plans, policies, and strategies, will be maintained, to foster shared action and ensure inclusive stakeholder engagement across diverse actors- national, subnational, municipal, public, private, civil society, and community. Specific agencies (like the Sierra Leone Meteorological Agency) will be assigned specialised roles in the process, building on existing policies and processes, climate-related or otherwise.</p>
          <p>As noted earlier, The Sierra Leone Climate Finance Fund (SLCFF) will be formed to mobilize and track the flow of finances. The architecture will include a Board of Directors or Steering Committee operated under the EPA with the EPA Executive Chairperson as the Board Chair; members taken from key stakeholder institutions, including select MDAs, private agencies, international donor organisations, and civil society. A Terms of Reference (ToR) and a strategic plan will be drawn to guide the establishment and running of the fund. On another hand, Sector Leads will be identified for rolling-out MRV actions and ensuring effective coordination. The Sector Leads will be part of a Sector Working Group (SWG) responsible for planning and delivery, as well as coordination with various District Working Groups (DWGs) at the subnational level. These structures will mainstream climate priorities and actions into subnational development plans, budgets, and other efforts.</p>
