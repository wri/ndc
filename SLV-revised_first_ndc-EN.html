              <h2>Preface</h2>
              <p>The Salvadoran State is aware of and proactive in the face of the seriousness and acceleration of the global phenomenon of climate change, in terms of an urgency in mitigating its causes (anthropogenic GHG emissions) at a global level – rooted especially in carbon dioxide emissions from of the energy sector of the economies – and an adaptation to its manifestations, effects at the national and local levels with the purpose of reducing the risk of the impacts of climate change and variability in the different socioeconomic sectors, natural and human systems that make up the economy , the society and the environment of this country.</p>
              <p>Recognizing that the biophysical, sociocultural, economic, and environmental conditions of El Salvador determine a historical and multifactorial accumulation of susceptibility; the threat of the manifestations and effects of climate change and its associated variability, comes to accentuate the vulnerability and exposure to which it is subject, at the level of ecosystems, agroecosystems and human settlements, as well as on human life and all life forms.</p>
              <p>Given this situation and, in response to the mandate established in the Primary Law and secondary laws of the country, referring to the obligation of the State to ensure the inhabitants, the enjoyment of freedom, health, culture, economic well-being and justice Social; as well as the duty of the State to protect natural resources, the diversity and integrity of the environment to guarantee sustainable development, public regulation actions have been implemented, aimed at creating feasible conditions to face the seriousness of climate change and its associated variability.</p>
              <p>El Salvador is part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), since 1995, and within the framework of its ultimate objective and specific objectives, principles, structure, operation and stipulations, it participated in the negotiation and approval of the Paris Agreement, which, months later, was ratified based on the mechanisms of national law in consent, acceptance, support and contribution to the objective of making all the necessary efforts by each of the parties, based on the principle of “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities” in light of different national circumstances.</p>
              <p>Based on the urgency detailed by the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change, referred to by Working Group I on the Physical Science Bases of Climate Change (2021), there is hardly a narrow margin of action to global level, in order to achieve the objective of the Paris Agreement.</p>
              <p>For El Salvador, it is important and mandatory to stop the magnitude and acceleration that climate change manifests and projects between now and mid-century in 2030, in such a way that the most emitting countries can establish GHG mitigation commitments, according to their responsibility and, at the same time, mobilize and transfer resources, in financial, technological and capacity terms.</p>
              <p>For its part, El Salvador submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC, which was later adopted, in 2015, as its First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). From the commitments derived from its First NDC, El Salvador has made important progress: creating a regulatory framework and institutional arrangements; developing technical studies to analyze national circumstances, the contribution to GHG emissions and climate risk for different sectors and systems; analyzing needs, opportunities and barriers in terms of means of implementation and establishing national development priorities and objectives in the strategic framework for climate change to achieve a low-carbon society, economy and environment with adaptive and resilient capacity. In addition, El Salvador is preparing the monitoring, reporting and verification system for the NDC, projecting its presentation in an immediate addition to this document in 2022.</p>
              <p>Also, based on article 3 of the Paris Agreement, El Salvador has made and is communicating progressive and successive efforts to identify its priorities, measures, goals, needs and opportunities, based on the improvement of information attributes, clarity , understanding and transparency; thus presenting the Second Contribution Determined at the National level of the Salvadoran State, before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in compliance with its commitments before the Paris Agreement.</p>
              <p>This effort has included a construction process with experts and the establishment or formation of sectoral roundtables of the government sector that will include a process of participation of different actors, including the Academy, Non-Governmental Organizations and private companies with the purpose of identifying and consolidating sectoral implementation plans, to fulfill the promises of this NDC and ensure suitable, effective and timely climate action.</p>
              <p>In accordance with the provisions of the Environment Law that establishes stewardship over climate adaptation, El Salvador determines its priorities by defining climate change as a strategic issue. Thus, it is projected for the five-year period 2020-2024, the promotion of the incorporation, mainstreaming of the environmental dimension in sectoral policies, ensuring the strategic management of climate change.</p>
              <p>Therefore, climate change management, and the NDC as part of it, contribute to comprehensive disaster risk management, environmental management, and climate change adaptation and mitigation, through systematic monitoring, early warning, and research. scientific, providing information services for the State, as a whole, productive sectors and citizens, in order to reduce loss of human lives and economic losses. In addition, to promote sustainable development low in emissions, vulnerability reduction and resilient to climate change.</p>
              <p>All of the above, based on national efforts and resources, in addition to having the support of international cooperation; emphasizing the importance and continuing need for the mobilization and transfer of financing and technical assistance, as means to facilitate the implementation and full application of adaptation and mitigation measures.</p>
              <p>Only an increase in international support and cooperation will allow El Salvador to increase, from now on and in the medium (until 2025 and 2030) and long term (beyond 2030), its low-carbon development and the improvement of resilience and adaptive capacity to contribute, from the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capacities, to the achievement of the global goal of the Paris Agreement, so that the increase in global average temperature does not exceed 2°C or 1.5°C in 2100, without previous shocks, thus slowing down the magnitude and acceleration with which climate change manifests itself to enable adaptation to its effects and reduce the risk of impacts.</p>

              <h2>Presentation</h2>
              <p>In compliance with the commitments acquired by El Salvador within the framework of the Paris Agreement (Article 3 and Decision 1/CP.21), this update of the Nationally Determined Contribution includes the components of response measures (Chapter II mitigation and adaptation), regulations and institutionalization (Chapter III), means of implementation, financing, development and transfer of technologies and capacity building (Chapter IV) prepared based on Decisions 4/, 9/ and 18/CMA.1. The component of the transparency framework for the monitoring, reporting and verification of the NDC will be presented in an update of this NDC during 2022.</p>
              <p>In terms of its contribution to the global mitigation of climate change, El Salvador is committed to having a reduction in annual emissions (by 2030 and with respect to a baseline scenario (BAU) from 2019) of 640 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq from fossil fuel burning activities. in the Energy Sector and up to a reduction in annual emissions of 819 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq in the same activities and sector, if during the period up to those years the technological models, financing structures, regulatory frameworks and massive capacity-building processes with international support in accordance with the provisions of articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
              <p>In addition, El Salvador agrees to have a cumulative reduction in emissions, for the period between 2035 and 2040, counted from 2015, of 50,857.5 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq for emission reductions and activities to increase carbon sinks and reservoirs in the agricultural landscape of its AFOLU sector, provided that large-scale financing is obtained from international and national sources with the participation of the private sector.</p>
              <p>For this update, El Salvador presents climate change adaptation measures for the Agriculture, Hydroelectric Generation, Infrastructure, Health, Sanitation and Solid Waste, and Transportation Sectors, and priorities to promote adaptation in the Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Cities and Water Resources Sectors. Also, in terms of regulations and institutionalization, El Salvador expresses the achievements achieved since its first NDC and updates this framework in order to guarantee compliance with the commitments.</p>
              <p>And, finally, the Means of Implementation are presented that contain the support received in the period 2015 to 2021 to facilitate the implementation of the first NDC (2017), as well as the support required to substantially promote the implementation of the measures of this NDC; structuring them in the categories: financial support, support granted for the development and transfer of technologies, support that has contributed to the promotion and strengthening of national capacities.</p>
              <p>In this process, compliance with public finance arrangements, financing systems, implementation mechanisms and instruments, monitoring and verification of results will be given relevance; preparation and execution of implementation plans, capacity building of the sectors and development of an intersectoral and multilevel coordination approach, which integrates the contribution of national technical-scientific, financial and public policy resources, with the support of the international community. In such a way, that the Salvadoran State meets the proposed goal of mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change.</p>

              <h2>I. Preamble</h2>
                  <p>Administratively, El Salvador is made up of 14 departments grouped into four geographical zones (central, paracentral, western and eastern) and 262 municipalities. For the year 2021, a population of 6,325,827 inhabitants is counted; 61.7% is located in the urban area; 38.3%, in the rural area. It has one of the highest population densities on the continent with 302 inhabitants per km2 at the national level. The Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (AMSS), the political and economic center of the country, has 3% of the national territory and concentrates 25.9% of the population (DIGESTYC, 2021).</p>
                  <h3>Climatology of El Salvador</h3>
                  <p>El Salvador is a tropical country with a surface area of 21,040 Km2, located on the Pacific coast of Central America (Fig. II.1). Its climate has small changes in temperature from one season to another, although the rainfall regime clearly shows a relatively dry season and a rainy season, which is why we speak of a monsoon climate. Changes in the position and intensity of the InterTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or in the activity of cold fronts, tropical waves or hurricanes largely modulate the climate. In June and September, rainfall is intense and prolonged, they are known as "temporary" (Magaña et al., 2010).</p>
                  <p><img width="317" height="244" alt="picture" src="img/SLV-NDC1-1.png"></p>
                  <p>Figure II.1. Geographical location of El Salvador in Central America.</p>
                  <p>Source: MARN 2021.</p>
                  <p>On a regional scale of the country, the orography is a factor that determines the climate because the mountain chain in the northern part of El Salvador causes a large part of the country to be located in the lee (behind) of the east wind coming from the Caribbean. (trade winds), reducing the injection of humidity from the Caribbean in the dry season. For this reason, the rains decrease much more in El Salvador compared to the countries that have coasts on the Caribbean slope.</p>
                  <p>In El Salvador there is a rainy regime with a dry season between November and April, with March and April being the hottest months (Fig. II.2). The intensity of precipitation during the rainy season (May to October), presents a relative minimum during July and/or August corresponding to the so-called "canicula". The behavior of the rains is bimodal, observing two maximum rain peaks, under normal conditions: the first, in the month of September, and the second, in June. During the dry season (November to February), that is, during the winter of the Northern Hemisphere, the presence of cold fronts near the Central American region predominates. To a large extent, the dry or rainy season is a result of the position of the ITCZ. Between November and February,</p>
                  <p>In the rainy season (May to October) trade winds with moderate and high moisture content from the Caribbean Sea appear, as well as tropical waves that determine the rainfall regime for El Salvador. In the month of June and until September, the Eastern Pacific InterTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is associated with the occurrence of storms, low-intensity rainfall and continuous or intermittent character.</p>
                  <p>From June to September, the ITCZ is located between 10 and 12° N, so humidity, clouds and rains approach El Salvador. In certain years, the ITCZ can remain close to the geographic equator even from June to September, as happens in years with El Niño. These years can result in meteorological droughts (Magaña <i>et al.,</i> 2010).</p>

                  <p>The temperature of the sea off the coast of El Salvador is around 28 °C and its effects on rainfall are those characteristic of a pool of hot water where convective activity develops (Fig.II.2). In climatic terms, sea surface temperatures above 28 °C favor the development of deep clouds and precipitation.</p>
                  <p>An element of great importance is the temperature of the sea off El Salvador. The climatic analyzes carried out for the country have adequately captured the characteristics of El Salvador's climate and can be used as a reference to assess climate simulations, either in seasonal forecasts or for climate change scenarios (Magaña <i>et al.,</i> 2010).</p>

                  <h3>GHG emissions</h3>
                  <p>Regarding El Salvador's contribution to the anthropogenic causes of climate change, the Third Communication on Climate Change estimated the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (INGEI) for 2014, in addition to the existing inventories for 1994, 2000 and 2005.</p>
                  <p>The results show that 57.8% of GHG emissions (11,793.6 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq, net) come from the AFOLU Sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use); 30.7% (6,268.5 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq), from the Energy Sector; 9.2% (1,871.2 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq), from the Waste Sector, and 2.3% (461.6 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq), of the Industry Sector (Fig. II.3). The country's GHG emissions, for that year, they were 20,394.9 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq, corresponding to 78.3% of CO<sub>2</sub> (15,978.7 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq, net); 17.5% CH<sub>4</sub> (3,577.6 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq); 3.7% N<sub>2</sub>O (753.3 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq, net), and 0.4% HFC (85.3 KtonCO<sub>2</sub>Eq) (Fig. II.4).</p>

                  <p>Historically, and up to the present, El Salvador has generated very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for which its contribution is not significant at the global level. Given that nearly 90% of the emissions generated come from the AFOLU and energy sectors, the mitigation measures are oriented, especially, towards these sectors, without ruling out the development of mitigation measures for the Waste and Industry Sectors in the next updates of the the NDC and other country policies.</p>

                  <h3>Manifestations and impacts of climate change</h3>
                  <p>In El Salvador, the alteration of the climate associated with climate change is manifested for the variables and observable behaviors of the climate in the tropics, also considering that the studies and global data on the increase in the World Average Temperature (TMM) indicate that, in the tropics As in the polar regions, the temperature increases are and will be of greater magnitude than in the temperate zones. In El Salvador, one of the already observed manifestations of climate change is the increase in the average temperature for 2010, of approximately 0.60 °C since the 1970s and around 1.2 °C compared to the period 1961-1990.</p>
                  <p>The mean annual rainfall in El Salvador has been the lowest in Central America (1769 mm) with a downward trend in rainfall of -3.6% between 1980 and 2006 compared to the period 1950-1979 or a reduction in mean annual rainfall of 0.38 mm/year for the period 1961-1990 (Centella <i>et al</i> ., 2000, UNAM 2010) (Fig. II.5).</p>
                  <p>Wetter decades, as a result of interdecadal variation, could mask larger reductions in precipitation. The manifestations of extreme climatic events for El Salvador would be congruent with those that have been detailed for the regional level, since national and regional historical records have been surpassed for extreme hydrometeorological events, especially for intense rains and droughts in intensity, duration and intensity. territorial expansion.</p>

                  <p>Regarding future climate change projections in El Salvador, the first future climate change scenarios prepared for El Salvador (Centella, 2000), within the framework of the First National Communication on Climate Change (MARN, 2000), indicated that the temperature mean annual rainfall would already be increasing from 0.8 °C to 1.1 °C in 2020 and from 2.5 °C to 3.7 °C in 2100 and, in the case of mean annual rainfall, although the projections were more uncertain, they presented ranges from -11.3% to +3.5% for 2020 and from -36.6% to +11.1% for 2100, in both cases, compared to the period 1961-1990. August, and that there would be reductions in the monthly volume of rainfall in September.</p>
                  <p>In relation to the increase in average temperature, future projections of climate change for El Salvador indicated in 2010 that for the A2 emissions scenario (medium-high emissions level), there would be increases in the average annual temperature of 1.7 to 2.3 °C. in 2050 and from 3.8 to 5.2 °C in 2100, compared to the period 1980-2000 (UNAM, 2010). For an A1B emissions scenario (average emissions level), a change of 1.0 to 1.2°C was determined for the 2010-2039 period, 1.2 to 1.4 °C for the 2040-2069 period, and 2.8 to 3.0 °C for the period 2070-2099, compared to the average temperature for the period 1900-1999 (Magaña <i>et al</i> ., 2010) (Fig. II.6).</p>
                  <p>The latest climate change scenarios developed confirm that the average and minimum temperature will present increases in the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, under all the RCP scenarios (Table II.1), the foregoing may involve changes of between 1.4 °C and 3.7 °C towards the end of the century (MARN, 2018).</p>

                  <p>The projections in the intra-annual climate patterns show a progressive increase in temperature in all months without significant changes in this pattern, except for a greater increase in temperature between April and October, determining greater variability throughout the year. . On the other hand, the changes in the intra-annual precipitation pattern indicate that, for an A2 scenario, the rain in the first period would increase in June and the maximum precipitation in the second period would occur between October and November compared to the period 1980 to 2000. .</p>
                  <p>Likewise, the heat wave would have been accentuated in July and August in the following decades, the precipitation would be substantially reduced in the first period from April to July and in the second period in September. Between 2020 and 2085 there would be increases in rainfall in April and decreases in May, which could indicate a delay in the start of the rainy season in May and a false start in April.</p>
                  <p>Around the year 2100, the bimodal form would have been progressively lost due to a decrease in rainfall in the first period, especially in May, while the rainfall in October would be the maximum of the entire year, with a displacement of the end of the rainy season until December (ECLAC, 2012) (Fig. II.8).</p>

                  <p>Figure II.8. Intra-annual pattern of (a) monthly mean temperature and (b) monthly precipitation for El Salvador at different time horizons, for Scenario A2, compared to the period 1980-2000. Source: ECLAC, 2012.</p>
                  <p>Regarding extreme hydrometeorological events (MARN 2015), as manifestations of climate change and its associated variability, in El Salvador, historical records of registered rainfall in intensity, duration and territorial extension have also been broken. This both on a national scale and throughout the Central American region, as occurred in 2011 with tropical depression 12E, in very localized areas with extreme intensity for a period of six hours, as occurred in 2009 in Saint Vincent, with the associated low pressure 96E to Hurricane Ida. A variant between the two occurred in 2010 with storm Ágatha, severely impacting the western region of the country.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the following four years, from 2012 to 2015, became predominantly dry, breaking in 2014 the record for the driest month of July since the country has records, and, likewise, the first quarter of the rainy season 2015 was the driest on record to date.</p>
                  <p>The extreme variability of precipitation, in a territory as small as ours, was also manifested in a particularly acute way in the month of July 2012, in which the monthly precipitation recorded at a station in the department of Sonsonate was approximately 500 mm. , while, in one of La Unión, the record was barely 5 mm, a hundred times smaller.</p>
                  <p>The frequency of extreme events such as hurricanes and heavy rains has been multiplying in the country and in the Central American region in recent decades. While in each of the 60s and 70s of the last century only one of these phenomena was recorded, in the 80s there were two, in the 90s there were four, and from the beginning of the century to 2011 there were nine. Since 1980, half of these phenomena originated in the Pacific Ocean, while in one and two decades before, they only came from the Atlantic.</p>
                  <p>The most recent weather events have left millions of dollars in losses. Thus, for Tropical Storm Ida, losses are estimated at USD$315 million, equivalent to 1.44% of the country's GDP; for storm Ágatha, damages and losses are estimated at USD$112.1 million, which represented just over 0.5% of the country's GDP; storm 12-E left damages and losses estimated at USD$1.3 billion, equivalent to 6% of GDP; Amanda and Cristóbal, an economic loss of USD$8 million and infrastructure losses of USD$22.1 million are estimated, and an amount undetermined damage to grain, vegetable and fruit crops; and the droughts of 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2018 left economic losses of USD$208.7 million and destroyed 227,601.88 manzanas of basic grains (MARN, 2021).</p>
                  <p>The various impacts of climate change and its associated variability, in particular, the increase in average temperature, the reduction in annual accumulated precipitation, the change in precipitation patterns and extreme events, are experienced in different socio-economic sectors and natural and human systems of the country, such is the case of agriculture, biodiversity, cities, hydroelectric generation, infrastructure, water resources, sanitation and solid waste, health and transportation, which have specific attention in terms of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation in their corresponding NDCs.</p>
                  <p>These conditions determine the exposure and vulnerability of the territory and of those who inhabit it, in the face of the threats of climate change and its associated variability; but, also, they condition the priorities of the country and the action of the State. Not only based on the implementation of actions at the local and territorial level, but also for its contribution to the global response, for example, in the face of the commitments of the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC.</p>

                  <h2>II. RESPONSE MEASURES</h2>
                      <h3>1. Mitigation</h3>
                      <p>Pursuant to Decision 4/CMA.1 (FCCC/PA/CMA/2018/3/Add.1, March 19, 2019) and the Paris Agreement (Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 13, among others), The Salvador presents its response measures in mitigation, providing the necessary information for the purposes of a progression in the attributes of clarity, transparency and understanding, with respect to the First NDC of El Salvador (2017) and considers that in the process of implementation and accountability of accounts of the reduction of emissions and anthropogenic absorption, corresponding to these NDC (2021), the principles of environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy and exhaustiveness, comparability and coherence must be promoted and applied; and also, avoid double counting and double counting, and ensure that real, additional and non-displacement mitigation actions are integrated.</p>
                      <p>It is important to note that, based on Decision 1/CP.21, Paragraph 31, (FCCC/ CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1, December 12, 2015), El Salvador has included the emission categories and anthropogenic absorptions in the commitments of this NDC, depending on the availability of information, capacities and scope of the country in this purpose, stating that for the missing categories, El Salvador will be strengthening its capacities so that they are covered in a future update of its NDC.</p>
                      <p>The categories of sources and sinks, which are integrated into this NDC, are detailed for each of the mitigation measures, they refer only to the Energy Sector and the AFOLU Sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use), based on the Guidelines of the 2006 IPCC for national greenhouse gas inventories.</p>

                            <h3>1.1. Energy Sector</h3>
                            <p>From the Energy Sector, and based on a "bottom-up" approach, El Salvador will be reducing its annual GHG emissions between 819 and 640 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq by 2030, based on measures 1.1.1 and 1.1.5, whose GHG annual emission reduction goals confer values between 485 and 306 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq (Goal 1.1.1.A) and 334 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq (Goal 1.1.5.A), for 2030. Both goals are additional to each other and provide the result previous.</p>
                            <p>This sector establishes measures 1.1.2 and 1.1.3, expressed in “Non-GHG type” indicators, and measure 1.1.4 as accumulated GHG reductions, which will be prepared and presented in the next update of the NDC. from the country. The annual GHG reductions calculated for these measures will be additional to goal 1.1.1. and 1.1.5.</p>
                            <p>El Salvador has the priority of implementing its National Energy Policy 2020-2050, with the following strategic objectives:</p>

                      <p>By 2030, annual GHG emissions will decrease to a value in the range between 308 and 487 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq, which corresponds to a reduction between 61% and 39% in relation to the BAU scenario; according to which, 2019 emissions were 986 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq, leading to a tendency to reach 793 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq in 2030. This means a reduction in annual emissions between 485 and 306 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq in 2030 in relation to the emissions of the BAU scenario. (Fig.I.1).</p>
                      <p>By 2025, annual GHG emissions will decrease to a value in the range between 346 and 540 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq, which corresponds to a reduction between 39% and 5%, in relation to the BAU scenario, according to which emissions in 2019 were of 986 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq, which leads to a tendency to reach 570 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq in 2025. This means a reduction in annual emissions between 224 and 30 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq in 2025 in relation to the emissions of the BAU scenario (Fig.I.1).</p>
                      <p><strong>1.1.1. B. Goal based on the installed capacity of renewable energies for 2030 and 2025</strong></p>
                      <p>By 2030, the installed capacity of renewable energies will increase by 50% compared to 2019 (base year), to reach a value of 2,222 MW, which represents a 64% share of renewable energies in the country's installed capacity matrix . In the base year, the installed capacity of renewable energies was 1,482 MW (66% share of renewable energy in the country's energy matrix) (Fig. II.2).</p>
                      <p>By 2025, the installed capacity of renewable energies will increase by 14% compared to 2019 (base year), to reach a value of 1,684 MW, which represents a 58% share of renewable energies in the country's installed capacity matrix. . In the base year, the installed capacity of renewable energies was 1,482 MW (66% share of renewable energy in the country's energy matrix) (Fig. II.2).</p>
                              <p><strong>1.1.1. C. Goal based on the proportion of electricity generated from renewable energies for 2030 and 2025</strong></p>
                              <p>By 2030, between 86.1% and 85.7% of electrical energy is generated from renewable energy compared to 70% of electrical generation that came from renewable energy in 2019 (Fig. III. 3). By 2025, between 83.7% and 82.7% of electrical energy is generated from renewable energy, compared to 70% of electrical generation that came from renewable energy in 2019 (Fig. III.3).</p>
                              <p><strong>Methodological aspects</strong></p>
                              <p>The BAU scenario, which had 2015 as its starting point and was used for the First NDC (2017), was updated to a new BAU scenario with projections from 2019, which also incorporates new energy variables, the impact of the COVID- 19 in 2020, the prospects for economic growth and the new long-term development vision of the National Energy Policy 2020-2050.</p>
                              <p>To calculate the reduction of GHG emissions in electricity generation (Goal 1.1.1.A), for 2025 and 2030, based on "GHG type" verifiers, the BAU Scenario was compared with a high intensity scenario of decarbonization, with another scenario of low intensity of decarbonization. These scenarios include, to varying degrees: economic growth variables, inclusion of renewable energy, energy efficiency hypotheses in consumption sectors, considerations for the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) systems, and the use of less polluting fuels. Resulting in a cleaner power supply, lower GHG emissions,</p>
                              <p>To calculate the increase in the installed capacity of renewable energy and the participation of renewable energies in the country's installed capacity matrix (Goal 1.1.B) for 2025 and 2030, with respect to the base year; High and low intensity decarbonization scenarios were considered. These scenarios include, to varying degrees: economic growth variables, inclusion of renewable energy, energy efficiency hypotheses in consumption sectors, considerations for the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) systems, and the use of less polluting fuels. Resulting in a cleaner power supply, lower GHG emissions,</p>
                              <p>However, although a common result of installed capacity is obtained for both scenarios, it should be mentioned that different generation technologies are considered in these scenarios: the high-intensity decarbonization scenario contemplates the use of natural gas technology with Capture and Storage of Carbon (CCS), while the one with low intensity of decarbonization, considers conventional natural gas technology (Fig.III.2).</p>
                              <p>To calculate the increase in the proportion of electricity generated from renewable energies in the country's installed capacity matrix (Goal 1.1.1C), for 2025 and 2030, compared to the base year (2019), the scenarios of high and low intensity of decarbonization. These include, to varying degrees: economic growth variables, inclusion of renewable energy, energy efficiency hypotheses in consumption sectors, considerations for the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) systems, and the use of less polluting fuels. Resulting in a cleaner energy supply, lower GHG emissions, expansion of the generating park under a focus of optimization of operation and investment costs and incorporation of strategic guidelines of the National Energy Policy.</p>
                              <p>It should be noted that, although there is the same installed renewable energy capacity for both scenarios, they use different technologies with different investment and operating costs, so the dispatch of electricity between these scenarios is different. This determines that there is always a range in reaching the goal, even if this range is very narrow (Fig. III.3).</p>

                              <p>By 2030, there will be an annual consumption of 124 GWh for public electric lighting, which means an accumulated saving of 34 GWh compared to a BAU Scenario, in which an annual consumption of 126 GWh in 2019 is assumed, with a trend which would imply a consumption of 128 GWh in 2030, by not applying energy efficiency measures.</p>
                              <p><strong>Methodological aspects</strong></p>
                              <p>The country will be advancing in the characterization of the energy consumption of the lighting demand at the level of municipalities and distributors, as well as in the quantification of GHG emissions that will be mitigated by its implementation.</p>
                              <p>To calculate this goal, the BAU Scenario was compared with a high-intensity decarbonization scenario that includes, to different magnitudes, economic growth and energy efficiency variables, resulting in improved energy use components, less GHG emissions , evaluation of the cost-effectiveness in the implementation of these measures.</p>
                              <p><strong>Implementation framework</strong></p>
                              <p>This measure is part of the NDC, within the framework of the implementation of the National Energy Policy and the Energy Efficiency Strategy, which involve interaction with many State entities, the Academy, the private sector and international cooperation.</p>

                              <p><strong>Perspectives and approaches</strong></p>
                              <p>The country will be developing studies to identify and make visible the aspects that link the implementation of this measure with aspects pertinent to the gender approach, NNAJ (boys, girls, adolescents and young people), commitments with local communities, ancestral and local knowledge.</p>

                              <p>Additionally, vehicle sales projection models and technological characterization models of the vehicle fleet were built to estimate survival curves, age curves, vehicle retirement rate and key parameters to estimate the future energy consumption of the sector (such as <i>fuel economy</i> and average annual travel).</p>
                              <p>In addition, four electric vehicle penetration scenarios were established: reference, modernization, transition and decarbonization. A more ambitious decarbonization scenario was obtained with 20% of electric vehicle sales in 2030, a modernization scenario, with lower penetration, with 7% of electric vehicle sales for the same year.</p>

                            <h3>1.1. Ad. needs and opportunities</h3>
                            <p>El Salvador proposes the following needs and opportunities for the implementation of its mitigation NDC in the Energy Sector and to strengthen progress towards updating its NDC, in 2025 or earlier, as deemed appropriate:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                <p>Electricity savings, and substitution of the use of LPG for solar and thermal energy, in the Dairy Agroindustrial Sector.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                <p>Substitution of petroleum derivatives for renewable energies for the different industrial and commercial sectors of the country.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                <p>GHG mitigation options, due to the replacement of current means of land transport, by different sustainable means of transport.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                <p>Promotion of renewable energies, efficiency and energy savings at the community level, integrating the gender approach NNAJ (boys, girls, adolescents and young people), ancestral and local knowledge.</p>

                              <li>
                                <p>Planning aspects of energy saving and efficiency at the level of government institutions.</p>
                              </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>1.2. AFOLU Sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use)</h3>
                      <p>For the AFOLU sector, based on a "bottom-up" approach, El Salvador will be accumulating an emission reduction of 50,857.5 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq (Meta 1.2.1.A), through emission reduction activities and activities to increase sinks. and carbon reservoirs, in the agricultural landscape of the country.</p>
                      <p>These emissions are additional and will be counted, registered and reported by the Salvadoran State in the categories, activities and emission sources of the AFOLU sector, including when referring to other monitoring, reporting and verification commitments before the UNFCCC, in addition to the NDC, for example: in the National Inventories of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI) of the Biennial Reports and the National Communications on Climate Change.</p>
                      <p>From AFOLU, El Salvador has the priority of implementing its Ecosystem and Landscape Restoration Program (PREP), as a key instrument of the National Environmental Policy, to reduce the country's vulnerability to the threat of climate change and variability. .</p>
                      <p>The Program includes three strategic areas:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>Restoration of critical ecosystems through social inclusion processes to recover key ecosystem services in water recharge areas, riparian ecosystems, areas susceptible to landslides, fragile and sensitive habitats, and ecological connectivity sites;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Restoration of highly degraded areas, through the establishment of climate-resilient agroforestry systems, the adoption of sustainable agriculture resilient to climate change and friendly to biodiversity</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Synergistic development of physical infrastructure and natural infrastructure.</p>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>Likewise, El Salvador will be including, in its next update of the NDC, quantitative national goals for each of the emission categories of this sector, in a manner consistent with the national proposal for the AFOLU 2040 Initiative, which contemplates achieving Carbon Neutrality in this sector by 2040.</p>
                      <p>For AFOLU mitigation measures, the PREP goal of restoring one million hectares is considered, under a landscape-scale intervention model in which there is coexistence and interdependence of different types of land use (including ecosystems and agroecosystems), grouped into eleven categories.</p>
                      <p>However, only six of these eleven current land use categories, referring to the transition to low-carbon agriculture and livestock, will have "GHG Type" indicators to report a mitigation contribution (Table III.1).</p>
                      <p>The total of eleven categories, whose respective areas add up to approximately one million hectares, have been integrated into an adaptation measure of the Agriculture Sector (Measure 2.1.7) with “Non-GHG Type” indicators, since they refer to risk reduction climate (Table III.2).</p>
                      <p>This ensures that the NDC has consistency between a mitigation and adaptation measure that refers, spatially, to the same activity at the territorial level; but at the same time, double accounting, registration and reporting of emission reductions or adaptation verifiers is avoided in the transparency framework for monitoring, reporting and verification that will complement this NDC.</p>

                      <p><strong>1.2.1. Reduction of GHG emissions and increase of carbon sinks and reservoirs due to actions of restoration and rehabilitation of degraded lands in the agricultural landscape, and a transition towards low-carbon agriculture and livestock, which includes agroforestry systems, practices low in GHG emissions and restoration of degraded soils in six current land use categories: maize and bean crops, grasslands, crop and grassland mosaics, crop mosaics, grassland and vegetation (<900 msnm), sugarcane, crop and grassland mosaics , corn and beans, vegetation and sugar cane</strong></p>

                              <p>Local Restoration and Sustainable Environmental Development Plans have been developed collectively in the prioritized landscapes, with the participation of local communities, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, small producers, local governments and indigenous peoples, allowing to obtain information on restoration opportunities at the municipal level.</p>
                              <p>The process includes the analysis of the dynamics of environmental degradation and the identification of vulnerabilities: prioritizing the sites to be restored, selecting the corresponding techniques, establishing alliances and institutional arrangements for their implementation, monitoring the actions and their impacts. An inter-institutional space or platform should be formed and developed at the level of government institutions, especially between the MARN and the MAG, to ensure discussion, consensus and decision-making on technical-scientific, political and means of implementation aspects (financing, technologies and capabilities) for this measure. In addition, to know the dynamics of degradation, it is necessary to establish an executed methodology, a monitoring system,</p>
                              <p>In addition, the participation of the Academy, non-governmental organizations, local producers, trade unions, private companies, the agribusiness sector, international cooperation, rural communities and indigenous peoples is required to facilitate the implementation of this mitigation measure. be counted, registered and reported by El Salvador in its contribution to the objective of the Paris Agreement. The foregoing, to overcome the obstacles and barriers related to the regression and elimination of the direct and underlying causes of deforestation and land degradation in the agricultural landscape. Especially, in terms of opportunity costs, awareness and public communication, sustainability of means of survival, development of opportunities and benefits from agricultural activity.</p>
                              <p><strong>Conditioning elements</strong></p>
                              <p>This activity has current financing with available national funds, local investments and regional cooperation funds. A large-scale financing amount has been identified for the total area of the six current land use categories and their corresponding transition proposals towards more resilient sustainable systems.</p>
                              <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the MAG, as the governing entity of the agricultural issue in the country, and other executing organizations, must access sources of climate financing, for the purpose of the restoration and rehabilitation of degraded lands in the agricultural landscape and a transition towards low-carbon agriculture and livestock, as well as other areas of interest to the AFOLU sector.</p>
                              <p>It is worth mentioning that, with this measure, activities for the conservation of biodiversity are promoted through ecological rehabilitation in agricultural areas and ecological restoration of degraded lands in critical areas, in consideration of rural livelihoods and survival, with a vision of adaptation to climate change and reduction of vulnerability.</p>
                              <p>The conservation of the structure, composition of ecosystems, agroecosystems at the landscape scale, preservation of the functions of the hydrological cycle: soil, air and microclimates, have direct benefits in the sustainability of cities, environmental and human health.</p>

                      <p><strong>1.2.2. A. Goal based on the consolidation of a mitigation measure for 2025</strong></p>
                      <p>By 2025, the country will have developed a strategy and adopted mitigation actions in cattle farming at the national level in order to consolidate and present a measure with quantified GHG mitigation goals, in the next update of the NDC, in the subsectors, categories, detailed activities and sources.</p>
                      <p>To this end, the following mitigation actions will be integrated: a) production and use of probiotics in cattle feed; b) planting and use of live fences; c) shade and multipurpose trees; d) planting and use of improved pastures; e) planting and use of protein banks and energy banks; f) rotation and rational use of pastures and g) treatment and use of bovine manure.</p>
                      <p>The result of this goal with "non-GHG type" indicators, which will be the establishment of a measure with quantified "GHG type" goals, in the next update of the NDC, in the subsectors, categories, activities and sources now detailed, will be contributing to the achievement of Goal 1.2.1.A. Above all, since the establishment of silvopastoral systems, in the term of accumulated reduction of GHG emissions between 2035 and 2040, for which this consideration must be taken into account when applying the monitoring and reporting of the future goal, to avoid duplication in the counting of emissions.</p>
                      <p>Theoretically, it is considered that a mitigation goal from the livestock sector would be producing emission reductions between 230 and 1,389 Kton CO<sub>2</sub>Eq, only by applying mitigation actions related to enteric fermentation, manure management and the reduction of the application of synthetic fertilizers.</p>
                      <p><strong>Methodological aspects</strong></p>
                      <p>To achieve this goal, a project is being implemented based on which national mitigation actions will be agreed upon in the bovine livestock sector of El Salvador, through:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>Implementation and research at the level of experimental pilot farms;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Coordination of appropriate and demonstrative actions with guilds, organizations, ranchers and ranchers;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Technical assistance (for example, how Nitrous Oxide and Methane gases are measured on farms);</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Capacity building in general.</p>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                          <p>Work has been done with national unions and 1,000 ranchers (10% women) and 200 small and small producers (15% women) with direct assistance, mainly in the department of Morazán, in the east of the country, in an Experimental Pilot Farm. in CEGA-Morazán, and, to a lesser extent, with members of the Association of Agricultural Producers of Nueva Concepción (APANC de RL) in the department of Chalatenango, in the north of the country.</p>
                          <p><strong>Implementation framework</strong></p>
                          <p>The mitigation actions that will be part of the future goal, in the next update of the NDC, do not confer drastic changes in production, nor higher investment costs to be implemented; neither do they seek an increase in production, but rather a reduction in costs in cattle farms and their profitability.</p>
                          <p>It is expected that these actions will have the capacity to reduce GHG in cattle farming and the conditions for benefited farmers to increase milk production, especially with the use of probiotics, improved pastures, protein and energy banks. that will allow the provision of food in times of meteorological droughts and intense rains.</p>
                          <p>In addition, from the execution of experimental pilot farms, an andragogical methodology is developed through:</p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              <p>Field Schools and workshops where the implementation of alternatives and the involvement of producers will be promoted;</p>

                            </li>
                          </ol>
                      <p><strong>Conditioning elements</strong></p>
                      <p>The executors are the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), through the General Directorate of Livestock, with the support of IICA, together with CENTA, ISTA, ENA, and the UES. This measure is currently financed with a grant from GIZ and a counterpart from MAG. In addition, the mobilization of South-South cooperation between Central American countries. Additional funds will be required for the implementation of the measure with quantified GHG mitigation goals, which will be consolidated and presented in the next update of the NDC.</p>
                      <p><strong>Perspectives and approaches</strong></p>
                      <p>In the methodological implementation of this measure, the involvement of young people is encouraged for generational change and the empowerment of women, since these groups have not traditionally been included in productive livestock activities.</p>

                              </li>
                              <li>
                                <p>Development and implementation of appropriate mitigation actions in Salvadoran coffee farming with the main objective of reducing GHG emissions throughout the value chain, which includes the establishment of a baseline for the quantification of GHG emissions, the evaluation of the reduction of GHG emissions and other environmental benefits generated by the adoption of said actions and the management for the consolidation of a mitigation measure in the next update of the NDC.</p>
                              </li>

                              <p>In 2025, there will be an increase in the number of genetic materials implemented since 2017.</p>
                              <p><strong>Implementation framework</strong></p>
                              <p>This measure will be carried out within the framework of the implementation of the Climate Change Policy for the Agricultural, Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector, the Climate Change Action Plan, the updating of the Agricultural Policy and the new Agroclimatic Sustainability Policy that entail an interaction with many State entities, the Academy, the private sector, international cooperation, cooperatives, unions and associations, producers and producers.</p>
                              <p>It is important to ensure the scope of these measures with the support of different sectors, especially for the issue of monitoring, reporting and verification of compliance at the country, territory and population levels.</p>
                              <p>In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the articulation of the centralized, decentralized and attached offices to the MAG, with emphasis on CENTA and the inter-institutional articulation with other organizations that generate invention, innovation, development and transfer of technologies and technical assistance.</p>
                              <p>It is necessary to improve the opportunities for access, mobilization and obtaining of financial resources, with special emphasis on access to funds to address climate change, directly by the MAG, specifically CENTA and CEDEFOR. In addition, the improvement of capacities at the institutional and individual level for access to funds in this area. The foregoing requires making the pertinent arrangements from the MAG with other government institutions, in coordination with the MARN as the focal point of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.</p>

                              <p>For the 2024-2025 harvest, the Sugar Agroindustry will be reaching an area of 27,600 ha mechanized (green harvest), in an equitable participation of producers and mills in the country. This will represent 35% of the total sugarcane cultivation area in El Salvador, based on a sustained annual increase in the participation of mechanized harvesting (green harvest) in the sugarcane production of the Salvadoran Sugar Agroindustry.</p>
                              <p>Each year, since the 2017-2018 harvest, progress has been made over an area equivalent to 3% of the total crop area (approximately 80,000 ha), reaching 17,650 ha of green harvest harvest for the 2020-2021 harvest, that is, that, by 2021, 22% of the sugar cane in El Salvador is already harvested in the green harvest in compliance with the commitments of the Sugar Agroindustry in the First NDC of El Salvador (2015).</p>
                              <p>This goal will be contributing to the achievement of Goal 2.1.7.A, which establishes the restoration of a potential area of 77,441 ha of sugarcane, through the eradication of burning for the period between 2035 and 2040. Therefore, it must have this consideration when applying the monitoring and reporting of the adaptation goal in that measure to avoid duplication.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Approaches and perspectives</strong></p>
                                  <p>Work continues on the eradication of child labor in manual harvesting and will expand towards mechanized harvesting. The ancestral harvest of sugar cane was manual and without burning, until the years before the civil war (1980). It is considered that the local conception is that manual green cutting is more difficult and risky, so the feasible option is mechanized harvesting.</p>
                                  <p>With the mechanized harvest (green harvest) there is an opportunity to integrate the gender approach in the production of sugarcane and, in the Sugar Agroindustry in general, extending job opportunities to rural women in order to guarantee the protection of their rights.</p>

                                  <p>The Manual of Good Practices for the Cultivation of Sugar Cane in El Salvador must be reviewed between FUNDAZUCAR and the MAG in order to reduce the risk of contamination of the cane (raw material for sugar production). In addition, to take actions to reduce the contamination of crops, water sources, flora and fauna as a result of aerial applications of chemical products.</p>
                                  <p>The commitment has been proposed and will be implemented by all sugar mills and producers, with the leadership of the Salvadoran Sugar Association and FUNDAZUCAR. In addition, public and private institutions related to the agro-industrial production of cane and sugar will facilitate the follow-up of this commitment, including the formation of an inter-institutional table for environmental management, addressing climate change and sustainability in the area of agriculture. sugar cane to be initially led by the MAG.</p>

                                  <p>With this measure of training and implementation of the Manual of Good Agricultural Practices, in the Cultivation of Sugar Cane, there is the opportunity to integrate the gender approach in the production of sugar cane and in the Sugar Agroindustry in general, extending opportunities labor, development and participation of rural women, youth and adults to guarantee the protection of their rights.</p>
                                  <p>In addition, work will continue on the eradication of child labor in manual harvesting, and it will expand towards mechanized harvesting and other labor areas of sugar cane cultivation and production. Complementing with direct collateral benefits in support of School Centers in rural communities, through the dissemination of this measure, its scope and the links with people, ecosystems and landscape.</p>
                                  <p>It is important to consider ancestral knowledge in the vision of sustainable agriculture, the proposal of the local communities, the local knowledge and the opinion/demands of the communities in the application of good agricultural practices in the production of sugar cane, the protection to the environment and adaptation to climate change at the landscape scale.</p>

                              <p><strong>Implementation framework</strong></p>
                              <p>Local Restoration Plans and Sustainable Environmental Development Plans have been developed collectively in prioritized landscapes that cover the total area to be restored/rehabilitated in the country, to obtain more resilient territories, conserve biodiversity, maintain livelihoods and livelihoods, and protect productive activities in order to achieve more sustainable local economies.</p>
                              <p>This will include the participation of local communities, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, producers from the agriculture sector, local governments and indigenous peoples, in order to:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li>
                                  <p>Obtain information on restoration opportunities at the municipal level;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  <p>Analyze the dynamics of environmental degradation and the identification of vulnerabilities:</p>
                                  <p>1) prioritize the sites to be restored; 2) select the corresponding techniques; 3) establish alliances and institutional arrangements for its implementation; 4) monitor actions and their impacts. A monitoring system for the scope and impact results of previous actions has already been established.</p>
                                </li>
                              </ol>
                      <p>Among all this, the obstacles and barriers related to the reduction of deforestation and degradation must be identified, especially in terms of opportunity costs in production, awareness and communication actions, sustainability of livelihoods, development of opportunities and benefits for agricultural activity, restoration of ecosystems and landscape and benefit of the population in general.</p>
                      <p>The strengthening of the inter-institutional work space led by the MAG and with the participation of the MARN will be favorable to ensure discussion, consensus and decision-making on technical-scientific and policy aspects for the implementation of this commitment. In addition, the MAG and other executing organizations must access funds from international agreements and international cooperation for the restoration and rehabilitation of the agricultural landscape in relation to compliance with this NDC.</p>
                      <p><strong>Sustainability elements</strong></p>
                      <p>This activity has current financing with available national funds, local investments and regional cooperation funds. A large-scale financing amount of around $9,147,143,380 for 1,001,405 ha has been identified in 11 proposals for the transition from current land use to more resilient sustainable systems.</p>
                      <p>However, the items corresponding to mitigation, through Measure 1.2.1, and adaptation, through Measure 2.1.7, must be disaggregated, in addition, as these will be awarded for their implementation among the different State portfolios, linked to the implementation of these measures.</p>
                      <p><strong>Approaches and perspectives</strong></p>
                      <p>To make adaptation possible through the restoration and rehabilitation of one million hectares, referred to in this measure, the actions must be carried out based on the consideration of participation and adjustment to the needs, opportunities and requirements of communities and populations living in conditions of greater vulnerability. , including: women, girls, boys, adolescents and young people, rural communities and producers, and indigenous peoples.</p>
                      <p>The foregoing, in consideration and application of the Principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent, which is applied to obtain funds and facilitating mechanisms from international cooperation, as well as for the benefit of the population in compliance with their rights.</p>

                                <p>Support for the implementation of the Agricultural Rescue Master Plan that includes two strategic pillars: a) Agricultural Transformation Plan for Food Sovereignty, b) Plan for the Sustainable Takeoff of Coffee. Both as clear bets on climate-resilient, low-carbon agriculture, increasing water capacity and conserving biodiversity.</p>
                              </li>
                            </ul>

                      <p>From 2005, with a projection until 2025 (after the entry into operation of the Central 3 de Febrero, in 2023), more than 146 ha of forest will have been established with an assisted natural regeneration approach on land surrounding the perimeter of the future reservoir, of said Power Plant, in the Torola River Hydrographic Basin, in the Lempa River Hydrographic Region.</p>
                      <p>This goal will be contributing to the fulfillment of Goal 2.1.7.A through the rehabilitation of an area of 18,930 ha of riparian forest, for the period between 2035 and 2040, so this consideration must be taken into account when applying monitoring. and reporting of the adaptation goal in that measure to avoid duplication.</p>
                      <p><strong>2.4.1. B. Target based on forest managed area</strong></p>
                      <p>From 2013, with a projection until 2025, 46 ha of forest will be managed in the perimeter of the Cerrón Grande reservoir (Potonico sector) and in areas surrounding the 5 de Noviembre Hydroelectric Power Plant, in the Río Lempa Hydrographic Region.</p>
                              <p><strong>2.4.1. C. Goal based on the managed area of plantations</strong></p>
                              <p>From 1980, with a projection until 2025, 427 ha of plantations will be managed for restoration in the vicinity of the Hydroelectric Power Plants that CEL manages and operates.</p>
                              <p><strong>Implementation framework</strong></p>
                              <p>In the implementation of: a) Goal 2.4.1.A, the establishment of the 146 ha, since 2005, is part of the environmental compensation for the development of the El Chaparral Hydroelectric Project (formation of the reservoir, infrastructure works and streets) ; b) goal 2.4.1.B, the management of 46 ha is as compensation measures for the execution of the projects: expansion of the 5 de Noviembre Hydroelectric Power Plant and the 115 KW Transmission Line El Chaparral-15 de Septiembre, since 2013 and c) goal 2.4.1.C, management is by voluntary efforts of CEL.</p>
                              <p>Additionally, as a project managed by CEL, from 2015 to 2025, five Mega Nurseries have been established and maintained in the CEL facilities, for the production of plants of various forest and fruit species, using them in the areas achieved with the previous goals. . In addition to the delivery of plants to interested organizations and entities for reforestation projects in the Río Lempa Hydrographic Region, other regions and hydrographic basins of the country.</p>
                              <p><strong>Sustainability elements</strong></p>
                              <p>It is currently implemented with CEL's own funds, but a high investment is required to guarantee the long-term sustainability of activities, especially in: a) establishment, development and sustainability of plantations and forests; b) reversal of underlying causes of deforestation and degradation, direct causes such as illegal extraction practices, hunting and burning; many times rooted in socio-cultural values at a social and local scale; c) protection tasks that include field supervision by CEL guard-resources; d) permanent technical monitoring system to verify status, prepare reports, prioritize actions and make decisions.</p>
                              <p><strong>Approaches and perspectives</strong></p>
                              <p>There is a socio-environmental responsibility approach that contributes to the sustainability of the plantations and the development of the communities living in the areas of influence. Through educational programs with a focus on gender, children and youth, and indigenous peoples, for the protection of reforested areas and the implementation of good agricultural practices.</p>
                              <p>There has been local economic strengthening, at the level of families of young people who work as resource guards. In addition, during the dry season, CEL supplies water from the reservoir of the 15 de Septiembre Hydroelectric Power Plant, for irrigation of crops in the Lempa-Acahuapa Irrigation District, in an agreement with the MAG and considering the local needs of communities and the producing population in the territory.</p>

                      <p><strong>2.5.1. A. Goal based on the implementation of infrastructure works at the community level</strong></p>
                      <p>By 2025, green and gray infrastructure works will have been implemented at the community level, such as measures against floods in the Acelhuate Hydrographic Basin and measures against landslides in the Las Cañas Hydrographic Basin, with a scope of at least eight municipalities.</p>
                      <p><strong>2.5.1. B. Goal based on the implementation of housing rehabilitation actions</strong></p>
                      <p>By 2025, housing improvement infrastructure works will have been implemented with a scope of at least eight municipalities.</p>
                      <p><strong>Implementation framework</strong></p>
                      <p>Between 2021 and 2022, an initial diagnosis of sectors, populations and communities is carried out to establish the scope of this goal. In addition, there is an international consultancy to accompany the diagnosis, planning, execution and closure of the initiative, as a fundamental requirement for financing the intervention.</p>
                      <p><strong>Sustainability elements</strong></p>
                      <p>The loan has been approved by the Legislative Assembly and the Ministry of Finance, for the intervention with international cooperation funds. However, additional funds are required to be able to replicate this measure in other areas of the AMSS.</p>
                      <p><strong>Approaches and perspectives</strong></p>
                      <p>The project involves aspects related to obtaining decent housing for women, considering, in addition, that women confer a higher level of empowerment in the subject of Disaster Risk Management and greater participation throughout the life cycle of the initiatives.</p>
                      <p>In addition, the consent and empowerment of the communities as a whole must be achieved, with the infrastructure works to be implemented, for example: through communication tools (community empowerment booklet) and educational tools (information for the long-term maintenance of the works) .</p>
                      <p>It is relevant that these actions aimed at housing and other uses considered vulnerable include non-structural measures, such as actions to build resilience, such as: generation of detailed cartography, zoning of permitted land use, education of communities in risk management and strengthening of early warning.</p>

                            <h3>2.6. Water resources</h3>
                            <p>This sector presents a country priority related to the promotion of the sustainable management of water resources, for which the sustainable management of hydrographic basins is an imperative, through the implementation of actions, activities and initiatives that integrate the adjustment from socioeconomic sectors and natural and human systems to the manifestations and effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle, the soil, microclimates and biodiversity, at the landscape level.</p>
                            <p>It is worth mentioning the extensive participation of actors, with efforts directed towards this management, such as: central government institutions, municipalities, non-governmental organizations, private companies, academia, rural and urban communities, indigenous peoples, unions, producers and producers. As well as the importance of the inclusion of gender approaches NNAJ (boys, girls, adolescents and young people), of ancestral and local knowledge, in raising this country priority.</p>
                            <p>It should be noted that the opportunities for developing adaptation strategies and measures in this sector depend on the objectives, content and scope of the Water Resources Law, which is under discussion in the Legislative Assembly at the time of the presentation of this law.

                            <p>Between 2021 and 2025, there is a nutritional surveillance model developed and validated with application at the national level.</p>
                            <p><strong>Implementation framework</strong></p>
                            <p>For the implementation of this measure, an inter-institutional coordination is considered led by CONASAN and strengthened with: ISSS, FOSALUD, MINSAL, ISRI, DNM, INS, COSAM, Teacher Welfare, among others from the Integrated Health System. The current non-standardization of the climate change approach in interventions must be overcome. In addition, its thematic application in the political agenda of the institutions and dependencies of this sector.</p>
                            <p><strong>Sustainability elements</strong></p>
                            <p>The process of budget growth, intersectorality and the flow of means of implementation from international cooperation must be maintained</p>
                            <p><strong>Approaches and perspectives</strong></p>
                            <p>Incorporation of the vulnerabilities of girls, boys, women and men in the surveillance process, through data segregation, consideration of gender aspects and guarantee of rights. So that, in all processes, including the provision and provision of health services, there is equal participation of women and men without any kind of discrimination.</p>

                      <p>Regarding the link to make public finance actions for climate change viable, as part of the process of updating the NDC, the formation of a Climate Financing Table has begun, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Commerce and Investments of the Presidency of the Republic, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance through its directorates and units: Directorate of Economic and Fiscal Policy, Directorate of Public Credit, General Directorate of the Budget and the Procurement and Contracting Regulations Unit (UNAC).</p>

                      <h3>3. Aspects of sector regulations</h3>
                  <p>Based on the progressive fulfillment of the commitments established in the Expected NDC of 2015, progress is observed in the preparation of new regulatory bodies, updating of other existing ones and, to a lesser extent, approvals at the legislative, executive or ministerial level.</p>
                  <p>This is due to two considerations: first, the time required for the technical review processes and, second, the modification of priorities or technological proposals that require returning to the stages of analysis and preparation of proposals.</p>
                  <p>These advances are detailed in Annex 1 of the NDC document.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, to face this new period of national commitments, the actions in normative aspects and institutionalization are aimed at strengthening regulation and instrumentation for the implementation of framework regulations: concluding updating processes, elaborating new normative bodies that respond to recent technological scenarios for respond to new challenges and needs.</p>
                  <p>This has fostered synergy in the work of the institutions' technical and legal teams, which has a positive impact on the coordination between some sectors, allowing for more comprehensive and functional regulations.</p>
                  <p>In accordance with the foregoing, the organizational arrangements that some institutions have implemented to address climate change denote the responsibility with which the country's commitment is assumed. However, in most sectors <i>ad hoc</i> coordination schemes have been adapted as needs arise, implying more time to comply with processes, as well as increasing the risk for not having contributions in a timely manner, at the different levels.</p>
                  <p>Hence, it is important to strengthen the creation of spaces for articulation and dialogue, at the political, strategic and technical level, considering that they are vital to achieve successful results in the planned commitments.</p>
                  <p>The commitment to regulatory work and institutional arrangements proposed in each sector is detailed below.</p>

                      <h3>3.1. AFOLU Sector/Agriculture</h3>
                      <p>In the regulatory framework for compliance with the updated NDC in the AFOLU/Agriculture sector, the following is proposed:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>Update of the Policy, Plan and Strategy framework on climate change for the Agricultural, Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector of El Salvador. It includes the elaboration and implementation of the Agricultural Rescue Master Plan; preparation of the National Agricultural Policy; updating of the Forestry Law and its regulations; review, adjustment and approval of the draft Forestry Incentives Law.</p>

                          <p>Update of the Action Plan for the Restoration of Ecosystems and Landscapes with an MbA approach, 2018-2022.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Execution of the Plan to Fight Deforestation, Erosion and Desertification, in line with the United Nations Convention against the fight against diversification.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Execution of the National Reforestation Plan, prepared between MARN and MAG.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Review of regulations on the use of agrochemicals, review for the coherence of the Penal Code and legislation attached to the use of fire and agricultural burning; proper use of water resources and binding instruments.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Preparation of the action plan for the implementation of community biodigester projects for the production of organic fertilizers, based on the sustainable management of livestock waste (MIGOBDT).</p>

                        <li>
                          <p>Preparation of guides for the proper management and use of livestock waste biodigester projects (MIGOBDT).</p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                          <p>In this way, as a relevant institutional arrangement to address the issue of Climate Change, according to ministerial agreement No. 356 dated September 3, 2021, the Environmental and Climate Change Office of the MAG is created, reporting to the Ministerial Office.</p>
                          <p>This office acquires a coordinating role within the ministry to promote the implementation of the NDC, including internal and attached units. However, it is necessary to strengthen the spaces for articulation and technical dialogue, as well as, at a high strategic political level at the inter-institutional and intersectoral level.</p>

                                <h3>3.2. Energy Sector</h3>
                                <p>In the regulatory framework for compliance with the updated NDC in the Energy sector, the following is proposed:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>
                                    <p>Update of the relevant regulatory framework for the energy sector with special emphasis on laws and regulations related to the National Energy Policy, the Energy Efficiency Strategy, the promotion of the use of renewable energies, the energy transition, user protection and competitive prices. Also considering technological advances and the causes and effects of climate change.</p>
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    <p>Preparation of guides for the production of biofuels based on the sustainable management of livestock waste.</p>
                                  </li>
                                </ul>
                                    <p>The institutional arrangements for the sector are carried out by the CNE through the following instances: a) CNE Board of Directors with the Energy Cabinet, where ministers from different portfolios attend and have a high political-strategic character; b) Technical-operational spaces such as Work Tables where technical aspects are articulated (mobility, natural gas, created according to the need determined by the specialty) and c) memorandums of understanding or agreements with other institutions.</p>
                                    <p>It should be added that in the short term, the need to have more regulatory body is identified to continue improving the regulations based on the NDC of the energy sector, since, to date, the reforms made make the operation viable. Although, it is required that these impact the market or the conditions of the context.</p>
                                  </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The performance of the Infrastructure sector in matters of regulations will be oriented towards the preparation, revision and implementation of new and approved regulations, as the case may be, for which the following is proposed:</p>
                                <p>National in scope:</p>
                                <ul>

                          <p>According to the above, the articulation and comprehensiveness of the inter-institutional actions between the MIGOBDT, MOPT, MIVI and the regional planning offices, including COAMSS/OPAMSS, is seen as a determining element for the work on regulations to have a positive impact on planning. based on compliance with the updated NDCs.</p>

                                <h3>3.4. Health sector</h3>
                                <p>Regarding the supporting regulations for the updated NDC of the Health sector, the following is proposed:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>

All of the above in relation to the effects and impacts of climate change.</p>
                                  </li>
                                  <li>

                                    <p>Regarding the institutional arrangements of the sector, based on the competencies assigned by the National Comprehensive Health System, the National Health Council operates as an articulated, permanent body, of a consultative and propositional nature, whose main function is to identify, propose and enrich national health policies and plans, with the participation of all public and private social actors from the different sectors linked to development.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, taking into account the intersectoral approach embodied in the National Health Plan, it allows the MINSAL as a sector leader, to articulate and coordinate the Sectoral Technical Commission for Health, of which more than thirty institutions are part, including: civil society organizations , international cooperation agencies, among others. Currently, the sanitation component is included in its work agenda, within the framework of emergency care and disasters of all kinds, linked to international health regulations.</p>
                                    <p>Internally, it is in the MINSAL's interest to carry out the analysis of the creation of an organizational unit, to address the issue of climate change and compliance with the NDC, for which it is expected to place it on the work agenda in the short term. .</p>

                                <h3>3.5. Transport Sector</h3>
                                <p>The proposed regulations for the NDC of the Transport sector are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>Review and update the legislation of the transport sector to adapt it to the circumstances and threats posed by climate change.</p>

                      </ul>
                          <p>In contrast to the above, the transport sector does not have a specific instance of articulation and dialogue. However, on an occasional basis, they work on issues in a coordinated or bilateral manner when deemed necessary. Therefore, it is important to establish communication mechanisms or interaction spaces that facilitate technical work and decision-making at a high strategic political level.</p>

                                    <p>Preparation of guides for adequate water harvesting or sustainable management of rainwater.</p>
                                  </li>
                                </ul>
                                    <p>That said, the space for articulation and dialogue in the sector is carried out in the National Interinstitutional Committee for Hydrographic Basins, chaired by MARN and made up of: MAG, MINSAL, MIGOBDT, MOPT, ANDA, CEL and COMURES, among others. This space is made up of two levels; a political one, with the contribution of all the ministers who meet annually; and another technician, with the representatives appointed by the ministerial offices, who meet bimonthly.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, the current agenda responds to: a) analysis and response to demands from the FGR and Environmental Judges; b) definition of a water agenda for the Committee (oriented towards compliance with the SDGs); c) promote the implementation of the Environmental Restoration Plan in the Río Grande de San Miguel basin, with follow-up through work groups according to component and d) preparation of an Integrated Hydrographic Basin Management policy.</p>

                                <h3>3.7. Sanitation and Solid Waste Sector</h3>
                          <p>The regulation proposed in the update of the NDC of the Sanitation and Solid Waste sector is as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>Preparation of the National Plan for Comprehensive Waste Management, as of 2022, by MARN, including: general strategy for adequate waste management, prepared from the National Waste Diagnosis; objectives to be met in terms of prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling, recovery and final disposal; guidelines and the structure to which the comprehensive waste management manuals must adapt; indicators of compliance with the strategy and objectives defined in the Plan. This national plan must be updated at least every seven years.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Generation of guidelines for the preparation of waste management manuals.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>Preparation of waste management manuals by the "managers", considering the stipulations of the Law on Comprehensive Management of Solid Waste and Promotion of Recycling.</p>
                        </li>

                          <p>Approve and implement the regulations that are in the process of being prepared and consulted.</p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                  <p>In this regard, on institutional arrangements for the sector, currently, it is articulated bilaterally with the necessary instances. Instead, it is relevant to activate a space for dialogue and articulation in a technical table of the waste sector. Therefore, all regulations and instrumentation prepared, and prior to being approved, must previously comply with the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Law and the Regulatory Improvement Law, with emphasis on public consultation processes.</p>

                  <h2>IV. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
  <p>The means of implementation refer to the instruments and support mechanisms necessary to achieve the aspiration of the country that contribute to the adaptation and mitigation measures and priorities in accordance with the commitments established in the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>In such a way that the limited resources available to the country, and given the need to cover social deficits and current effects of climate change, El Salvador can hardly implement its NDCs without external support. In this context, the availability of international support, in the form of financing, development and technology transfer and/or support for capacity building, is considered a fundamental element that conditions the scope of the various goals proposed in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).</p>
  <p>Therefore, El Salvador ratifies article 4.7 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which reads: "The extent to which developing countries effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on how that developed country Parties effectively implement their commitments relating to financial resources and technology transfer, and full account shall be taken of economic and social development and poverty eradication as the first and essential priorities of Parties that are developing countries”.</p>
  <p>Likewise, the identification of the supports that facilitate the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation commitments defined by the Government of El Salvador is based on and totally aligned with the provisions of the Paris Agreement in its articles 9, 10 and 11, regarding the characterization of the financial support, the development and transfer of technologies, the creation and strengthening of capacities necessary to guarantee the implementation of the ultimate objective of the Convention and the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>Finally, this section adheres to the guidelines provided in Decision 18 CMA1, section VI, in relation to information on financial support for the development and transfer of technologies and capacity building required and received by the Parties that are developing countries. under articles 9-11 of the Paris Agreement.</p>

      <h3>1. National Circumstances</h3>
      <p>El Salvador, for the implementation of its climate agenda, has mobilized domestic resources, mainly from the national budget, added to the support of the international community. However, due to budget restrictions and the need to meet other urgent needs of the country, the international support received represents a <i>"sine qua non" element, that is, an essential condition</i> for the planning and implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. national and subnational level.</p>
      <p>However, the country has conducted, in recent years, important efforts to strengthen its capacities to ensure improved access, absorption and effective implementation of climate financing sources to accelerate a low-carbon and climate-resilient development path.</p>
      <p>In particular, with resources from the Green Climate Fund, from the Preparatory Support Program, in 2017-2018, El Salvador developed a Climate Financing Strategy, which included a roadmap with specific actions to prepare national institutions for to the eligibility requirements of various sources of climate finance.</p>
      <p>Similarly, an inter-institutional architecture was developed, which assigned roles and responsibilities to key actors from the central government and the private sector in relation to the management and implementation of financing for climate change.</p>
      <p>In addition, in May 2021, the Ministry of Finance approved by ministerial agreement the</p>
      <p>"Financial management strategy against disaster risk", which strengthens public finances and the country's fiscal resilience against the risk of emergencies resulting from extreme natural and climatic phenomena. From this, a one to three-year implementation plan will be derived, which is in the process of being prepared and will include a more detailed definition of the financial instruments to promote the implementation of the strategy.</p>
      <p>This is how El Salvador is promoting an initiative to implement a basic labeling mechanism for public investment, to facilitate the identification of investment in climate change. This has been prepared through the Ministry of Economy (MINEC) in the “Economic investment plan for the development of resilient projects”.</p>
      <p>However, despite all the efforts made, the country still requires support to implement large-scale transformative climate investments that generate a paradigm shift in the <i>Business As Usual</i> (BAU) scenario, in the various economic sectors and territories of the country. In general, central government institutions also require technologies and support in capacity building for improved access to climate finance and its effective and efficient implementation.</p>

      <h3>2. Underlying assumptions, definitions and methodologies</h3>
      <p>For the reporting of information on the support required and received by El Salvador, the US dollar is used as the reference currency, which represents legal tender in the country. However, support received in other currencies (mainly euros) is also taken up, presenting a conversion to the equivalent in US dollars according to the exchange rate established in the financing agreement signed with the respective donors.</p>
      <p>The compilation of information regarding the support required and received has been carried out through a broad consultation process with various institutions of the Government of El Salvador, including details on the sectors and subsectors covered by the support. Through this exercise, the institutions have reported financial support for the development and transfer of technologies and for the strengthening of capacities received in the period 2015-2021. As well as the support required from 2021 to support the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation goals defined in section II and III of this NDC.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the support received reported in this section and presented in Annex 2 of this document; They include support committed and disbursed in the 2015-2021 period, channeled by bilateral and multilateral sources and structured through various types of financial instruments, mainly donations and concessional loans.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, information on support in the form of technology development and transfer and capacity building has been compiled for each of the sectors and includes all external support that has contributed to increasing the country's capacity to respond to the climate change through innovative technologies and strengthened capacities.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the information reported includes an indication of the type of support, whether it is for mitigation, adaptation or cross-cutting actions that contain both mitigation and adaptation. Lastly, the report on support received includes a brief description of the use, effects and estimated and/or achieved results, where such information is available.</p>
      <p>Although the information compiled represents an important mapping of support received by the country, it is not exhaustive, since, as there is no system for monitoring, reporting and verification of climate finance in the country, systematic information is not available. . In other words, detail the support received by all relevant public and private actors involved in climate action, which was not channeled through the Central Government, which ultimately represents a major challenge for the country.</p>
      <p>Based on the presentation of the updated NDC, and following a participatory and equity and equality approach, El Salvador will begin the process of preparing the respective Sectoral Plans for the Implementation of the NDC, which will provide more details regarding the specific support required. and the routes to reach them.</p>
      <p>However, the discussions and feedback of the Sector Roundtables for the update of the NDC have left important findings regarding the means required to promote the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation measures defined in this second generation NDC, as well as crucial resources. importance to generate enabling environments that increase the ambition of the country for future revisions of the NDC.</p>

      <h3>3. Information on financial support required by El Salvador under Article 9 of the Paris Agreement</h3>
      <p>Considering the aforementioned factors and conditions of the national context, for the implementation of the NDCs, El Salvador requires effective and expeditious access to large-scale climate financing, including the resources that flow through the financial mechanism of the Paris Agreement. In particular, the country will seek to increase access to the resources of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) through donation instruments and loans under favorable conditions and other instruments that enable the participation of the private sector in the national climate agenda. and the Adaptation Fund.</p>
      <p>Through the Development Bank of El Salvador (BANDESAL), the Environmental Fund of El Salvador (FONAES) and the Initiative Fund for the Americas (FIAES), the country has instruments to channel national and international resources necessary to promote NDCs and all efforts to promote resilience and low-carbon development.</p>
      <p>In particular, the financial support required by each of the sectors to promote the mitigation and adaptation measures defined as national commitments is presented below. Most of the supports identified do not yet have a detailed cost estimate, since it will be carried out within the framework of the construction of the sectoral implementation plans that have been referred to in previous paragraphs.</p>
            <h3>3.1. AFOLU Sector/ Agriculture</h3>
            <p>In support of the mitigation and adaptation goals proposed by the AFOLU/Agriculture sector, the following financial support requirements have been identified.</p>
                <p><strong>3.1.1. Second National Forest Inventory 2023</strong></p>
                <p>The Government of El Salvador, through the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), together with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) and with the support of other government institutions, has defined the need to explore the provision of a mixed financial support that includes a donation component and technical assistance for an estimated amount of around USD$1 million to follow up on the first national forest inventory.</p>
                <p>This support is envisaged as a structured investment in various phases, starting in 2022, with a first preparation phase that includes adjusting the design of the forest inventory and preparing the platform. In addition, a second phase, in 2023, which involves the development of the inventory.</p>
                <p>The type of support provided is transversal (mitigation/adaptation) which, in particular, seeks to generate enabling environments for the implementation of the mitigation goal 1.2.1 and adaptation target 2.1.7.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.2. Garden Program for Food, Nutritional and Productive Security</strong></p>
                <p>This program aims to strengthen technical personnel on sustainable production technologies that will be transferred to producers through the establishment of demonstration plots and field schools.</p>
                <p>The purpose is to achieve the transition from traditional agriculture to sustainable agriculture, through technical assistance to cooperatives and communities to improve productivity, transformation and value addition capabilities in competitive markets. From this initiative, many families in all areas of the country have benefited. However, funding is needed to continue the scope of the program.</p>
                <p>For this reason, the required support has been estimated at an indicative amount of around USD$2,500,000 to be implemented in a period of approximately four &lt;v years from its approval by the funding source.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.3. Support for the promotion of resilient low-carbon livestock (Livestock NAMA)</strong></p>
                <p>The financial support required for this large-scale investment is aimed at promoting measures for mitigation, adaptation, protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. In particular, this support seeks to promote resilient livestock in a synergistic manner with the national livestock sector.</p>
                <p>In this same sense, mixed financing is required that allows the MAG to work in coordination with the private livestock sector to incorporate reforms to regulations that introduce a vision of resilient low-carbon livestock, inter-institutional articulation and reorganization of the governance structure of the subsector within of the MAG and investments at the farm level that allow the promotion of low-carbon resilient livestock.</p>
                <p>According to MAG estimates, the required support has an indicative amount of USD$57 million to implement the various strategic lines of the project.</p>
                <p>This required support is based on the NAMA Roadmap for the Bovine Livestock sector, developed through pilot technical assistance actions on mitigation and adaptation issues, capacity building, development of an MRV system for GHG measurement, among others. .</p>
                <p>However, it is still necessary to carry out the implementation of the MRV monitoring system, developed to consolidate the NAMA that can be registered in the <i>NAMA Registry</i> for its effective implementation in order to scale actions, expand the beneficiaries and transform the productive systems into resilient livestock farms. low carbon nationally.</p>

                <p><strong>3.1.4. Development and Implementation of NAMA Café</strong></p>
                <p>The coffee sector is one of the agricultural sectors that makes the most contributions in terms of providing environmental services in El Salvador. In recent years, due to low international coffee prices and extreme weather events that increased the incidence of pests, the productivity of coffee plantations has drastically decreased due to lack of investment, resulting in the vulnerability of the coffee forest due to degradation and change of land use.</p>
                <p>Currently in El Salvador, work has begun on the definition of the baseline of the Environmental Footprint of Coffee and the adoption of regulations through the Salvadoran Accreditation Body such as the "Norm ISO 14064-1 and ISO 14064-3, Relative to Greenhouse Gases (GHG): for the quantification and reporting of GHG emissions and removals; and for the validation and verification of GHG declarations» which is in a state of technical dissemination. These regulations would serve as advances for the design of a COFFEE NAMA for El Salvador.</p>
                <p>Therefore, it is through the development of a NAMA for COFFEE in El Salvador, that the entire coffee sector of the country can benefit, with the implementation of mitigation actions and transformation of the processes of the coffee value chain towards more efficient systems that allow the recovery of crop productivity.</p>
                <p>In such a way that new opportunities are generated for the commercialization of differentiated coffees and increasing the competitiveness of the sector in the different markets; with the main objective of reducing GHG emissions throughout the chain, strengthening the resilience of coffee plantations that represent the main forest and largest source of water recharge in the country.</p>
                <p>For all these reasons, the required support represents a holistic and strategic commitment that seeks to develop the NAMA COFFEE proposal for El Salvador and facilitate the implementation of good low-emission practices throughout the coffee value chain.</p>

            <h3>3.2. Energy/ Transport Sector</h3>
            <p>To promote the emission reduction goals in the Energy Sector of El Salvador and, particularly, in the generation of electrical energy through a growth in generation with renewable energy (Goal 1.1.1.), and the implementation of efficiency actions energy (Goal 1.1.2.) the following financial support is required:</p>
                <p><strong>3.2.1. Pilot Project in the Dairy Agroindustrial sector, by changing technology to save the use of electricity and replace the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) with renewable energies (solar and thermal)</strong></p>
                <p>This support request is structured based on a case study developed with the support of the <i>International Renewable Energy Agency</i> (IRENA), in collaboration with the European Commission through the EU Technical Assistance Mechanism (EUTAF), which seeks to serve as Demonstration project with great potential for replicability in other economic sectors.</p>
                <p>So the support is proposed as mixed financing that includes a donation component, another loan component under favorable conditions, and technical assistance to strengthen capacities and technology transfer.</p>
                <p>So support is required, particularly, for the development and application of a feasibility study and financial resources for the implementation of the pilot project in the agro-industrial sector, based on the use of active solar technologies, including photovoltaic panels and thermal solar collectors to collect energy.</p>

                <p><strong>3.2.2. Renewable energy and energy saving program at community level</strong></p>
                <p>Mixed financing (donation, concessional loan and technical assistance) is required to promote a program of renewable, efficient energy and energy savings at the community level, integrating the approach of gender, childhood, youth and adolescence, ancestral and local knowledge. Likewise, with a focus on health, sustainability and energy access and reduction of vulnerabilities to climate change.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the support seeks to provide the skills, knowledge and financial resources to facilitate a transition to more efficient refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. As a result of this support, education, communication and capacity building will be strengthened for actors at the local and community level on renewable energy and energy saving issues, promoting the co-responsibility of women and men in caring for the environment at the family and community level.</p>
                <p>As a result, the supports identified by the transport sector seek to generate improvements in the energy consumption of the transport sector, facilitating the reduction of GHG emissions in accordance with the provisions of Goal 1.1.5 of this NDC.</p>

                <p><strong>3.2.3. Support for the implementation of the “Mobile Source Emissions Regulation”</strong></p>
                <p>The regulation of mobile source emissions dates from the early 2000s, however, its implementation has been limited. In this sense, the objective of this support is to create emissions mitigation standards for the country and thus reduce most of the emissions of the different pollutants.</p>
                <p>Additionally, support in the form of mixed financing that includes a donation component and technical assistance is proposed from a participatory approach that involves other agencies and institutions at the national level so that it is a consensual and applicable standard.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the required financial support seeks the establishment of verification centers, improvement of technologies and equipment for monitoring emissions, among others.</p>

                <p><strong>3.2.4. Pilot program on infrastructure and technologies for sustainable mobility</strong></p>
                <p>The required support in the form of mixed financing that includes donation and technical assistance components will facilitate the implementation of technology for electromobility, including charging stations.</p>
                <p>Likewise, the support seeks to strengthen the capacities of the public and private sectors to acquire knowledge and experience for the electrification of mass transportation in the country and the exploration of other types of sustainable transportation.</p>
                <p>Finally, the required support will finance a pilot project to test electric bus technology, including the acquisition of a small fleet of electric buses that can operate in the topographical and market conditions of San Salvador (2-4 buses ), with potential for scalability and fleet expansion.</p>

            <h3>3.3. Infrastructure and Cities Sector</h3>
            <p>The financial supports described below seek to facilitate the implementation of Adaptation Goals 2.3. (Cities) and 2.5.1. (Infrastructure).</p>
                <p><strong>3.3.1. Support for the implementation of the Master Plan for rainwater management in the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (AMSS)</strong></p>
                <p>The required support is contemplated as a loan under favorable conditions for an indicative amount of USD $19 million to prepare a master plan for the sustainable management of rainwater in the AMSS, with a basin approach and an emphasis on water reuse.</p>
                <p>Likewise, the required financing seeks to promote the construction of lamination ponds that allow to reduce flooding problems and control the amounts of water, after extreme rains experienced more frequently in the context of climate change.</p>
                <p>This support seeks to enable the implementation of adaptation target 2.5.1.</p>

                <p><strong>3.3.2. Pilot program for the implementation of adaptation works in the Plan de la Laguna industrial zone</strong></p>
                <p>The Plan de la Laguna industrial zone is an important economic center in the capital that faces high vulnerability to the impacts of extreme hydrometeorological events.</p>
                <p>In this sense, the required support seeks to co-finance investments in adaptation works in the industrial zone, complementing the contributions of investors and companies interested in financing said works in the highly industrialized zone.</p>

                <p><strong>3.3.3. Pilot project for the protection and adaptation of slopes to ensure their stability against the effects of climate change</strong></p>
                <p>The required support seeks to replicate the Japanese technology that is currently being implemented on the slopes on the way to Surf City for its applicability in other areas. The support in particular is proposed as a loan under favorable conditions, despite the fact that an estimate of the costs of said project has not yet been made.</p>
                <p>Supports 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 are directly linked to adaptation goal 2.3 on cities resilient to the effects of climate change.</p>

                <p><strong>3.3.4. Pilot program: formulation, design and execution of healthy, resilient and self-sustaining housing solutions in the Marine Coastal Strip of El Salvador</strong></p>
                <p>The Government of El Salvador has begun the work of conceptualizing this effort in the coastal-marine strip linked to the Surf City project. Support is required that promotes efforts in the housing sector to go beyond an approach based solely on infrastructure, but rather includes a vision of resilience.</p>
                <p>In view of the above, financial support is required in the form of a loan under favorable conditions for the formulation and execution of the pilot project for healthy, resilient and sustainable housing in the Marine Coastal Strip, which will mainstream adaptation and resilience into the subsector housing in the coastal zone of El Salvador.</p>
                <p>Especially, because it already shows manifestations of climate change that include: increase in average temperature, change in precipitation patterns and extreme hydro-meteorological events. This support is linked to the Master Plan for Territorial Planning and Management of Priority Tourist Areas (Departments of La Libertad and Usulutan) (IDB-MITUR) and the Coastal-Marine Strip Tourism Development Program.</p>

            <h3>3.4. Water Resources Sector</h3>

                <p>The support required would include the development of business models that combine environmental compensation resources with co-financing from the beneficiaries and international financing.</p>
                <p>Likewise, support is required for the development and transfer of technology and innovation for the restoration of basins, including in areas such as: infiltration, water harvesting and decontamination, among others. Finally, the support will include a capacity-building component for the implementation of the Environmental Compensation Manual through work with the private sector that serves as a catalyst for climate action in watershed restoration.</p>

            <h3>3.5. Sanitation and Solid Waste Sector</h3>
                <p><strong>3.5.1. Comprehensive support for Waste Management</strong></p>
                <p>Based on the National Waste Diagnosis, support is required initially for the 262 municipalities in the development of local waste systems and plans. In follow-up to the preparation of the plans, capacity building is required in a series of issues that allow the promotion of comprehensive waste management, such as the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
                    <p>Analysis of costs for services;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Municipal regulations and installation of the decentralized office by each municipality (administration, operational, financial);</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Design of routes for the collection of solid waste and expansion of the provision of solid waste services;</p>

Climate.</p>
                  <p>This Public Policy on Climate Change, as a conceptual and strategic starting point, which identifies the first lines of action to be able to design a specific plan based on the powers of the MOP and to coordinate with other sectors linked to the issue of Climate Change.</p>
                  <p>In this way, the policy begins by delimiting the territorial scales of analysis, which locate the scope of intervention with an impact on territorial planning, urban development and city systems, public works, housing and transportation. It describes the climatic scenarios for El Salvador and presents a data characterization of the housing, public works and transportation sectors in the country.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, this National Policy was prepared within the framework of the Preparation Project for the Green Climate Fund in El Salvador, which had contributions from the Government of Germany, the European Commission and the United Nations Development Program.</p>
                  <p>The support was executed by the United Nations Development Program in the period 2014-2020, generating a strategic framework with lines of action that will allow organizing participatory actions, with officials from different dependencies of the MOPTVDU and other institutions of the Central Government, local governments and private sector representatives.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.3. Project to Strengthen the Capacities of the Directorate for Adaptation to Climate Change and Strategic Risk Management for the Reinforcement of Public Infrastructure, Phase II</strong></p>
                  <p>The Government of Japan (GOJ) and JICA have supported, in El Salvador, disaster risk management, as one of the priority areas of cooperation. In 2012-2015, Phase I of the Project to strengthen the capacities of the Directorate for Adaptation to Climate Change and Strategic Risk Management for the reinforcement of infrastructure was implemented by the DACGER, to improve its capacities in risk management against rain.</p>
                  <p>Thus, based on the new GOES request, the GOJ has decided to implement the Project (Phase II) in the 2016-2021 period and entrust it to JICA. The ultimate goal is that the vulnerability of road infrastructure to disasters is reduced.</p>
                  <p>It also seeks to strengthen the capacities of the Department of Adaptation to Climate Change and Strategic Risk Management (DACGER) to improve disaster risk management of road infrastructure.</p>
                  <p>The result of this support has been an improvement in the ability to diagnose risks against earthquakes for road infrastructure (bridges, embankments). Standardized specifications, design guides and cost estimation standards are prepared for the reinforcement of road infrastructure.</p>
                  <p>Thus, DACGER's capacity to manage disaster risk reduction projects for road infrastructure is enhanced. The results of the Disaster Risk Diagnosis Project and disaster risk reduction projects on highways are shared at the national level and with other countries.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.4. Increasing Climate Resilience in Public Works in El Salvador</strong></p>
                  <p>This operation is linked to the loan called Comprehensive Program for Fiscal Sustainability and Adaptation to Climate Change for El Salvador. Its objective is to contribute to fiscal sustainability and adaptation to climate change by reducing the physical and natural vulnerability of the country.</p>
                  <p>Specifically, this IDB support seeks to strengthen the country's institutionality, in such a way that physical and fiscal resilience to climate change is achieved as a result. The program is structured to consolidate the regulatory and policy advances initiated by the country in valuing existing infrastructure. This technical assistance included the contracting of consultants to develop methodologies for</p>
                  <p>assessment of the different public infrastructures focused on bridges, embankments, retention works, primary and secondary drainage.</p>
                  <p>In particular, as a result of the support, the methodology for the elaboration of vulnerability indices and the methodology for the evaluation of bridges have been developed; completed the inventory with the assessment of the country's infrastructure (focus on bridges); developed the methodology for evaluating public infrastructures (slopes, retention works, primary and secondary drainage); conducted workshops and publications for the dissemination of methodologies.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the support facilitated the updating of the regulations for the construction of infrastructure. While the second component of the TA made it possible to obtain updated regulations and/or new regulations created based on the projected impacts of climate change. Likewise, two pilot projects were developed with implementation of the updated/created regulations to verify if there has been a reduction in the vulnerability index. In addition, it facilitated the publication and dissemination of the regulations.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.5. Manual of hydrological and hydraulic technical considerations for road infrastructure in Central America</strong></p>
                  <p>In 1997, the Sectoral Council of Ministers of Transport of Central America (COMITRAN) approved the document: "The Transport Sector for the competitiveness and integration of Central America" which included in its recommendations the need to generate and harmonize innovative technical regulations that allow the region to improve and ensure the transit of people and goods in the Central American isthmus.</p>
                  <p>In this context, the Council has prioritized within its strategic areas of work; the issue of adaptation of public infrastructure to Climate Change, in order to increase the resilience of these works in the face of the constant threat of extreme natural phenomena that periodically occur in the region. Therefore, said Council formulates, develops and promotes a variety of structural (infrastructure) and non-structural measures, the latter framed in a series of regulations that reduce the vulnerability of road works that ensure optimal connectivity and development of the countries of the region.</p>
                  <p>This support focused on adaptation, financed by JICA, allowed the creation of a conceptual and methodological guide with guidelines for the determination of hydrological and hydraulic parameters for technical considerations in the design of road drainage works.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the manual considers risk management elements to be taken into account in the planning and design stage of roads and bridges of a regional nature. The methodologies or criteria set forth in this manual constitute technical standards for the designer of the work. Other methodologies and criteria can be used as long as the validity of the results is demonstrated through calculation reports.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.6. Risk reduction and elimination of social vulnerability</strong></p>
                  <p>The support provided by the Andalusian Agency for International Cooperation (AACI) in the 2017-2018 period sought to contribute to the implementation of the guidelines established in the Metropolitan Policy for Urban and Territorial Development, whose objective is to seek an environmentally sustainable city. These priority issues in risk management, specifically, in relation, are oriented to: Research, mitigation, knowledge and regulation, delving into issues such as volcanism, seismic microzoning, slope and embankment stability, quarries and hydraulic models of primary drainage.</p>
                  <p>The products of this support included: new geological map, geological engineering map, geomorphological map, surface dynamics map and macrostructures zoning map. The regulations at the AMSS level were updated, regarding soil studies. Ground movement maps with radar.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.7. Urban Adaptation to Climate Change in Central America- El Salvador Component</strong></p>
                  <p>The support financed by KfW has as its primary objective the strengthening of the institutions involved and the population in general, for the management of climate change risks and consulting services. The support will be executed in the period 2019-2024.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.8. Technical Guide for the design of SUDS in the AMSS</strong></p>
                  <p>The origin of the Guide arises from the need for a paradigm shift in the management of rainwater in the AMSS. Reason why the IDB's Water and Sanitation Division is providing support through technical cooperation ATN/LA-15861; ES-T1247 the Strategic Planning of the Storm Drainage Sector in El Salvador. The purpose is to reduce the damage to people and their properties, caused by the absence of an Integrated Management of storm drainage and flood control problems in the country.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of the Guide is to lay the foundations for the implementation of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) in the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador, establishing a methodology for its design, dimensioning, construction and maintenance, which are summarized in this document.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.9. Initial Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change of the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (PIACC-AMSS)</strong></p>
                  <p>The support provided by the IDB allowed the structuring of the Initial Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador, which defines the adaptation measures in the face of existing and future vulnerabilities associated with climate change, among which are considered: a) increased extreme precipitation; b) changes in annual precipitation; c) increase in temperature; d) education, strengthening and knowledge. This establishes the associated needs for financing, technology transfer and capacity building for its implementation based on the reduction of vulnerability to climate change.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3.10. National inventory of critical investments in strategic infrastructure in the face of potential events due to climate change El Salvador</strong></p>
          <p>The premise of this study supported by the UNDP is based on the fact that not all public assets or infrastructure have the same level of priority or relevance for the country, for certain regions or communities. There are assets whose conservation and loss prevention is strategic for different reasons: either because their operation and functionality is essential to ensure that essential services continue to be provided to citizens, even under disaster conditions. Consequently, the emergency situation is not admissible; or because its normal operation is vital for the performance of the national or subregional economy.</p>
          <p>According to the aforementioned, critical investments are identified in the sectors of the National Road Network and the Potable Water and Sanitation system to create the National Inventory of Critical Investments with potential threats due to the effects of climate change. Therefore, Investment Flows (FI) and Financial Flows (FF) are evaluated to face climate change in the Infrastructure sectors of the National Road Network and the Potable Water and Sanitation system. Therefore, it contributes to developing national policy options to address climate change in the selected subsectors.</p>

              <p>As for the workshops, they were developed within the framework of the signing of the cooperation agreement for the development, execution and strengthening of technical capacities in aspects related to the management of water resources in El Salvador, between the</p>
              <p>(MARN) and the Mexican Institute of Water Technology (IMTA) and the coordination of these was in charge of the Cooperation Fund for Water and Sanitation.</p>
              <p>The result was that in the workshops 448 people received training in integrated management of water resources, groundwater, water pollution, design of water quality monitoring networks, manifestation of environmental impact, management of droughts and floods.</p>

              <p><strong>8.4.2. Special course on water governance and water security: Territorial dynamics from the basin to the sea in transboundary spaces</strong></p>
              <p>The Special Course on Water Governance and Water Security: Territorial Dynamics from the Basin to the Sea in Transboundary Spaces, is organized by the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, El Salvador Program, in coordination with the subregional headquarters in Costa Rica, together with the Central American Commission of Environment and Development (CCAD), through the project Integrated Management of the Basin to the Reef of the Mesoamerican Reef Ecoregion (MAR2R) and the technical support of different International Organizations, through advice on the general design of the course, its promotion and dissemination and expertise in the modular content of the Course.</p>
              <p>The program consists of six online modules where conceptual bases, tools and experiences for good water governance will be presented. The Diploma is aimed at civil servants responsible for managing and making decisions related to water resources; members of organizations and projects involved in processes related to water management; and/or groups, committees or platforms for management of transboundary basins in Central America and those shared with Mexico.</p>
              <p>As for this program, it is carried out jointly with IUCN and the Central American Commission for Environment and Development and with the support of the BRIDGE Program "Transboundary Dialogues on Water" and the Project "Integrated Management of the Basin to the Reef of the Mesoamerican Reef Ecoregion ( MAR2R)».</p>

          <h3>8.5. Sanitation and Solid Waste Sector</h3>
              <p><strong>8.5.1. National Diagnosis of Recycling</strong></p>
              <p>Through the support provided by AECID, in the period 2021-2022, a National Diagnosis of Recycling is carried out, which will allow detailed information to be obtained on the current state and potential for scaling up recycling actions at the national level. The amount of support is USD$80,000.</p>

              <p><strong>8.5.2. Improvement of Solid Waste Management</strong></p>
              <p>This support represents a Technical Assistance component subject to a concessional loan of EUR 15 million. The transversal support has an amount of USD$1 million executed in the period from 2014 to 2019, supporting the MARN and municipal associations technically for a training consultancy.</p>

          <h3>8.6. Health sector</h3>
              <p><strong>8.6.1. Coordination and inter-institutional articulation in matters of climate change and health</strong></p>
              <p>The support provided by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) seeks to strengthen the coordination of seven institutions that work in the health sector and civil society organizations through the Intersectoral Health Commission (CISALUD) as an intersectoral work table.</p>
              <p>In this case, the issue of climate change was incorporated from various angles: environmental health, epidemiological surveillance, first level of care, etc. Although CISALUD no longer exists as a structure, the Social Plan maintains the mandate to work on climate change from an intersectoral perspective.</p>

              <p><strong>8.6.2. Sanitation and infrastructure for the proper management of excreta</strong></p>
              <p>With the support of UNICEF, progress has been made in the generation of standards for the use, construction and maintenance of resilient latrines, said technology is adapted for flood zones. Community approach methodologies, technical guidelines and regulations related to resilient latrines were developed.</p>

              <p><strong>8.6.3. Action Protocol for the Use of Pre-positioned Materials for the Humanitarian Response in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion</strong></p>
              <p>With the support of UNICEF, the Action Protocol for the Use of Pre-positioned Materials for the Humanitarian Response in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion has been developed. In it, numerous actions are detailed that the 19 organizations that comprise it must develop at the time of an emergency.</p>

              <p><strong>8.6.4. Application of the TrackFin Methodology (Monitoring of the financial accounts of the WASH sector)</strong></p>
              <p>For several years, PAHO/WHO has been promoting the Global Assessment of Drinking Water and Sanitation (GLASS) in various countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region. In this sense, El Salvador has been selected to carry out the application of the TrackFin Methodology (Monitoring of the financial accounts of the</p>
              <p>WASH), which represents a challenge because each country has a particular information registration system on the WASH sector and financial accounts.</p>
              <p>However, the results of the application of the TrackFin methodology in El Salvador will provide evidence for the design of public policy on the finances of the WASH sector. It should be noted that the application of the TrackFin in El Salvador will be part of an application exercise of said methodology in seven Central American countries simultaneously, which will be carried out with the technical support of a general coordinator and the technical teams of ETRAS, in order to have results at the country level and at the subregion level.</p>

              <p><strong>8.6.5. Creation of the Strategic Plan 2017-2021 of the ASH group</strong></p>
  <p>The strategic plan of the ASH group represents an operational instrument of actions, mapping of capacities, preparation and response at the territorial and national level from the various organizations that comprise it.</p>
  <p>In turn, technical support from UNICEF makes it possible to stimulate and strengthen actions at the central government level and at the different organizations. In addition, it supports the technical strengthening of the MINSAL in the direction of environmental health at the central and national levels.</p>

The total area of the Ramsar sites is 207,387 ha., which covers approximately 10% of the territory of El Salvador. The Olomega and El Jocotal Lagoons, the objective of this Project, are naturally formed lagoons that extend over the departments of La Unión, San Miguel and Usulutan in the east of the country, in which projects have been carried out. of sustainable development. Around the lagoons, there are about 19,500 local inhabitants who subsist mainly from fishing and cattle ranching, and they are an important source of income. Both lagoons in the lower part affect the Bahía de Jiquilisco Complex, which is the largest wetland in the country. Currently, the natural environment of these lagoons has deteriorated due to several causes, among them, domestic wastewater, cattle manure, agricultural or chemical, overfishing, invasive exotic species such as the Water Hyacinth and sedimentation. Also, the conflicts on the use of water for business purposes of production such as fishing and agriculture carried out by local residents. Under these circumstances, the Government of El Salvador has requested Japan to implement the Project, with MARN as a counterpart, whose objective is the preparation of the integrated management system for the Olomega and El Jocotal Lagoons. , in order to promote the conservation and reasonable use of wetlands in El Salvador.</p>
