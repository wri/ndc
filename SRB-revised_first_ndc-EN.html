  <title>SERBIA’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of the Republic of Serbia for the 2021–2030 period</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>The Republic of Serbia has been Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 2001 and to the Paris Agreement since 2017. In 2015, the Government of the Republic of Serbia submitted its Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs), defining a 9.8% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 compared to base year emissions (1990). The first NDC also refers to losses and damages associated with extreme weather events and indicates the need to adapt to climate change.</p>
  <p>The Republic of Serbia hereby communicates its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), in accordance with the Articles 3 and 4 of the Paris Agreement and paragraphs 22 and 24 of Decision 1 CP/21:</p>
  <p><i>Increasing</i> its ambition to the GHG emission reduction by 13.2% compared to 2010 level (i.e. 33,3% compared to 1990) by 2030, and</p>
  <p><i>Taking into account</i> that in the period 2015-2020 period, Serbia suffered damages estimated at EUR 1.8 billion, additional to EUR 5 billion in the period 2000-2015, caused by climate change and extreme weather events.</p>
  <p>The Republic of Serbia has signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union in 2012. This Agreement entered into force in September 2013. Thus, the country has committed to aligning its legislation on climate change to the EU acquis that will significantly contribute to the greenhouse gas emission reduction. Serbia is a landlocked country. Energy is one of the largest sectors of the Serbian economy, and the most of the electricity is produced in thermoelectric power plants (about 70%) using domestic low-calorific lignite, while the rest comes mainly from hydropower. Electricity consumption is very high, mostly due to the use of electricity for heating and a very low level of energy efficiency.</p>
  <p>The mean annual temperature increased in the period 2008-2017 relative to the 1961-1990 reference period by 1.5°C, while in the western and eastern parts of the country, the increase exceeded 2°C. Such trend will continue up to 2- 4.3°C until the end of the century. The annual precipitation increased by 10%, and in the southern part of the country up to 20% relative to the reference period15 The change in the mean annual precipitation will not be as pronounced as in the case of temperature change, but will be characterized by interannual precipitation redistribution, while during the summer season, the deficit of rainfall will be strongest.</p>
  <p>The vulnerability of water resources, agriculture, forestry, including biodiversity and health has already been confirmed, while experience in the last few decades shows negative effects of climate change to energy, infrastructure, transport and Serbian economy in a whole. In addition, COVID-19 pandemic impacts social aspects of Serbian society, implying job loss for 34,700 women and a net increase of 1,500 more jobs for men in the second quarter of 2020.<a href="#fn0" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref0"><sup>0</sup></a>.</p>

        <p>Adaptation of the technologies of agricultural plant and animal production (selection of species and agro-technical measures, increasing the quality of soil and rational use of fertilizers, adaptation of crop rotation, adaptation of zootechnical conditions in animal husbandry facilities). Appropriate selection of species might reduce water and nutrient supply, therefore, reducing GHG emissions. Increased agricultural biomass production can partly be used (crop residues, waste) for renewable energy production, replacing the use of fossil fuels<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Nutrient management’s mitigation potential was assessed to 1.09 Mt CO2 equ./yr.

In order to define a socially equitable and economically efficient GHG emission reduction pathway, impacts of Mitigation Actions on gross domestic product (GDP) on employment and share of energy costs in households for different mitigation scenarios were considered. Emission reduction target for 2030 was defined according to GHG emission reduction potential, as well as its impact on social, economic and environmental parameters.</p>
