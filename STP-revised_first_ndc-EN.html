<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Sao Tome and Principe (short, STP) is an African small island developing state (SIDS). Located in the Gulf of Guinea, the country is composed of two islands and various smaller islands and islets, with a total area of 1001 km2. Today, the country&rsquo;s population stands at about 215,000, with 65% living below the poverty threshold and about 30% lives without electricity. In 2019 the unemployment rate was close to 13.4%, while GDP growth stood at 4.5%, underlining its insufficiency in fulfilling the developmental needs. More than 90% of the State General Budget originates from external aid, and the debt level is also very high, at about 70% of GDP. These physical and socio-economic susceptibilities make Sao Tome and Principe very vulnerable to adverse climatic events.</p>
<p>STP&rsquo;s high vulnerability is in deep contrast to its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emission status since its territory is as an absolute carbon sink contributing to global CO2 removals. In September 2015, STP communicated its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) under the Paris Agreement. In addition, as a member of the Paris Agreement, STP will follow its transparency requirements; in other words, STP will participate in international biennial reporting and review cycles regarding GHG emissions, NDC implementation, as well as updating its NDC every five years. Consequently, STP&rsquo;s participation in the Paris Agreement and the implementation of its ambitious NDC measures will require financial resources from external sources, access to technology, and training.</p>
<p>The approved 2006 National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), in conjunction with the 2015 INDC and other documents produced in recent years - in the absence of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) - constitute the basis for the country&rsquo;s presentation of this revised and updated NDC proclaiming a broad sectoral approach with more ambitious measures and goals in relation to the 2015 NDC. Equally, STP will adopt an enhanced MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) system guaranteeing transparency and co-ordination within the Paris Agreement framework and strengthening its capabilities in data gathering and revision, consolidating its institutional framework, including the strengthening of the National Climate Change Committee and training of its members. STP seeks the acceleration of its NDC implementation in line with its Sustainable Development Objectives (SDGs) agenda.</p>
<p>With the support of the NDC Partnership, the Government of STP elaborated in 2018 the NDC Implementation Plan to advance the mitigation and adaptation components of its NDC. The NDC Implementation Plan builds off national and sectoral priorities and was designed through an economy- wide and whole-of-society approach including government institutions, NGOs, private sector, international partners, and academia. The Plan serves as a planning, coordination, transparency, and resource mobilization tool for the Government and is being implemented with the support of national and international stakeholders.</p>
<p>STP&rsquo;s nationally determined contribution (NDC), under the terms of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, represents a commitment towards mitigation and adaptation. Moreover, STP is set to track mitigation and adaptation proposals following the requirements of the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) foreseen in Article 13 of the Paris Agreement, detailed in decision 18/CMA 1. By implementing its contribution, STP offers the international community an alliance with its national objectives of both a post-COVID-19 pandemic green recovery and an opportunity to consolidate a more prosperous future by taking advantage of vast opportunities in pursuing low-carbon and resilient development.</p>
<p>The present NDC adheres to information, clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) requirements, in line with decision 4/CMA 1 as adopted at the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP 24).</p>
<p>STP&rsquo;s updated NDC is more ambitious and presents improvements in relation to its 2015 NDC (GHG reduction was at 57 ktCO2eq). In fact, mitigation contributions, with a total GHG reduction goal of 109 ktCO2eq, represent additional reduction of these gases of approximately 90% (equivalent to about 51 ktCO2eq). This increase in ambition is reflected also by the increase in the number of measures set forth in relation to mitigation, adaptation, and cross-sectoral measures. The number of measures rose from 18 to 29 compared to 2015, especially targeting the increase of renewable energy generation from 26 MW to 49 MW, as well as the increase in energy efficiency. The number of sectors covered is more comprehensive as they now include the energy, transport, fishery, agriculture, livestock farming, forestry, water, and waste sectors civil protection.</p>
<p>The elaboration of this updated NDC is the result of a participatory and consultative process involving key ministries, public and private sectors stakeholders, experts, civil society organisations as well as marginalised and vulnerable groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NDCs &ndash; Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC-STP)</p>
<h4>Mitigation Component</h4>
<p>The mitigation measures currently identified as contributions by STP are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An increase in renewable energy share integrated in the national grid;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a reduction in power grid losses and increase of energy efficiency; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a significant reduction in the transport sector&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the implementation of these measures, STP will be able to contribute towards an estimated GHG emissions reduction of 109 kTCO2eq, corresponding to a 27% emission reduction by 2030, with a total estimated cost of close to USD 150M.</p>
<p>The goal to reduce emissions is conditional to the availability and mobilization of external funding with the aim of reducing projected emissions in the business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios by 2030. The projected emissions are comprehensive for the entire country and cover all economic sectors, excluding the land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) sector given the country&rsquo;s climate neutrality estimated in initial GHG emissions inventory calculations.</p>
<h4>Adaptation Component</h4>
<p>With regard to adaptation, the NDC implementation plan&rsquo;s objective is to reduce climate-related risks and increase the resilience of communities and sectors by strengthening technical and institutional capacities, mainstreaming climate resilience into national and subnational planning and budgeting, and several investments.</p>
<p>The plan covers the agriculture, livestock, forestry, energy, transport, coastal zones, fisheries, water and the civil protection sectors.</p>
<p>Based on data from the NDC-STP, on its implementation plan and on the implementation of other national plans, stakeholders have identified the priority measures; their reformulation and integration embedded in a set of programmatic actions, as presented in the table in Chapter V, as well as its quantifiable goals. The latter will be made available in the NAP as of 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Means of Implementation</h3>
<p>Taking into consideration the national circumstances together with its financial incapacity to implement mitigation, adaptation and cross-cutting measures contained in its updated NDC, STP will need to resort to international financing in the form of grants or concessions to enable the country to comply with its updated NDC. Recourse to these financial mechanisms -- created or implemented by the UNFCCC, by the Paris Agreement and by development partners- serve to promote the elaboration and implementation of projects and programmes, technological transfer, and capacity-building.</p>
<p>The cost of reaching STP&rsquo;s NDC&rsquo;s mitigation goals is estimated at 150 million USD. This estimate solely covers project and programme implementation and does not include policy implementation, studies, nor the elaboration of preliminary studies to inform projects and programmes. The cost of implementing adaptation measures will be detailed in STP&rsquo;s future National Adaptation Plan (NAP). This document will develop follow-up, monitoring and transparency verification mechanisms with regard to the use of financial flows.</p>
<p>Other instruments, to be communicated to the Convention and under the Paris Agreement - BURs, NCs, BTRs and NDCs - will also report on the needs on international co-operation support received, as well as on its utilization, and they will be based on a robust and transparent national methodology enabling continuous and consistent monitoring.</p>
<p>With these tools and initiatives, Sao Tome and Principe will develop its long-term climate finance strategy based on the correct identification of its needs and priorities.</p>

<p>The Santomean state possesses an institutional and legal framework to address environmental challenges: The Ministry of Infrastructure and Natural Resources, through its General Directorate of Environment (DGA) created in 2007 by Presidential Decree 2/2007, is the lead ministry for the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in collaboration with the National Meteorological Institute (INM). Also, Law 10/99 &ndash; the Base Environment Law, dated 15 April 1999 -- created the juridical framework for environmental protection in STP.</p>
<p>Additionally, Decree 13/2012, published in volume 81 of the <em>Di&aacute;rio da Rep&uacute;blica</em>, official gazette, on 11 July 2012, created a National Committee for Climate Change for the implementation, co-ordination, follow-up and evaluation of the UNFCCC, while Law-Decree 17/11 establishes the creation of a disaster management entity, CONPREC, the National Council for Disaster Preparedness and Response.</p>
<p>Building off the national and sectoral plans and comprehensive consultations, in 2018, the country elaborated, with support from the NDC Partnership, a NDC Implementation Plan to drive mitigation, adaptation and crosscutting components of its NDC. The NDC Implementation Plan serves as a planning, coordination, transparency, and resource mobilization tool for the Government and is being implemented with support from national and international stakeholders.</p>

<p>STP is a small island developing state (SIDS) composed of two islands and various smaller islands and islets located in the Gulf of Guinea, with a total area of 1001 km2. The country&rsquo;s population stands at about 215,000, with 65% living below the poverty threshold; about one third of the population lives without electricity. STP&rsquo;s unemployment rate was close to 13.4% in 2019, while GDP growth stood at 4.5%, underlining its insufficiency in fulfilling its developmental needs. More than 90% of the State General Budget originates from external aid, and the debt level is also very high, at about 70% of GDP. STP can very easily be strongly affected by adverse climate change impacts given its physical and socio-economic vulnerability.</p>
<p><i>Gender policy.</i></p>
<p>Population projections put the current (2021) Santomean female population at 108,342 or, 50.48% of the total population. In reality as also in the various studies have demonstrated that, traditionally, Santomean women have been marginalised in every aspect of life when compared to men. The Government has committed to integrate gender issues and women empowerment, as evidenced by several official documents on policy orientation and strategy.</p>
<p>The concerns to adequately respond to the efforts arising from these promises have led the Government and its various development partners to adopt policies for implementation of plans, programmes and projects designed to eliminate or reduce inequalities while promoting and empowering Santomean women.</p>
<p>The National Strategy for the Promotion of Gender Equality and Equity (ENEIG) is the most important among several initiatives establishing both policy orientations and a strategy design focused on expediting the achievement of these objectives. ENEIG&rsquo;s first five-year strategic plan began in 2007, while the current five-year plan, elaborated in 2019, will run through 2026.</p>
<p>To the already difficult toll on the lives of women and girls lacking equity and equality, climate change is an added challenge. Thus, the current and third strategic 5-year plan is promoting a new approach, based on &ldquo;STRATEGY 8 &ndash; THE ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE&rdquo;, to lessen the consequences of ever more difficult climate challenges for women and girls, to promote gender integration in the water and hygiene sector, as well as to facilitate access to and management of natural resources, management of natural disasters, environmental cleanup, and climate action and the promotion of sustainable energy. The aim is to increase mitigation and adaptation participation by and integration of vulnerable groups. A singularly important decision adopted by the Government is the integration of gender issues into its various budgetary components, allocations and sectoral programmes.</p>

<p>STP recognises its own acquired experience with the implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism and wishes now, within the context of high environmental integrity, to be supported by market mechanisms that contribute towards sustainable development and establish strong incentives to take advantage of the private sector&rsquo;s potential.</p>
<p>In the medium and long term, it intends to plan and use the carbon market or new market mechanisms.</p>
<p>STP supports the use of market mechanisms, including the pre-2020 mitigation results, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Certified Emissions Reduction managed by projects and programmes implemented by the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon market efforts focused on viably transforming actions within the specific contexts of least developed countries, developing countries and SIDS; and,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further development of accounting rules within the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement to ensure the environmental integrity of market mechanisms and avoid double- counting.</p>

<p>Equity and Ambition &ndash; The evolution of STP&rsquo;s emissions is insignificant in comparison to global emissions and in terms of net emissions, as of 2012, it continues as a net CO2 sink country. Nevertheless, STP is ready to make efforts towards the reduction of additional emissions, as it receives financial, and technological resources as well as capacity strengthening support.</p>
<p>The NDC-STP is just, insofar as it responds to the country&rsquo;s vulnerability in terms of climate change impacts and offers its contribution as a developing country. It is also ambitious as it presents a higher goal than for 2015, i.e., a reduction of close to 109 KtCO2eq against the earlier proposal of 57KtCO2eq.</p>

<p>As an LDC and SIDS country, STP is not obliged to carry out NDC actions that are not conditioned by its development status, its territorial management and that it has never contributed to net global GHG emissions. Therefore, all contributions from Sao Tome and Principe in the area of mitigation are conditioned by the financial and technological support it may receive from abroad, as well as by the support received for strengthening of its capacities. However, in the spirit of increasing ambition and in order to demonstrate STP's commitment to combat global warming, the country is committed to develop a "finance tracking methodology", to be officially approved by STP government entities, which will allow the definition and presentation of unconditional mitigation actions from a subsequent NDC, that is, in 2025. In addition, it is noted that, for the period of implementation of this NDC, through the effort made by the Santomean government and with the kind contribution of international partners<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, it will be possible to reduce from 5 KtCO2e to 30 KtCO2e by the year 2030, considering the already pledged financial support to be provided.</p>
