  <h1>Eswatini's NDC</h1>
  <h1>Kingdom of Eswatini</h1>
  <h2>Update of the Nationally Determined Contributions</h2>
  <p>Submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</p>
  <p>October 2021</p>
      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>The Government of Eswatini submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015 and ratified the Paris Agreement on 21st September 2016. Post enforcement of the Paris Agreement in November 2016, Eswatini’s INDC came to be known as its first NDC. Eswatini is not a major contributor to the global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Although the impacts of climate change are largely linked to the historical and contemporary industrial development of other nations, like most countries in the Global South, the country is disproportionately impacted by the changing climate. Under these circumstances Eswatini presents its enhanced NDC, acknowledging that despite our contribution to climate change emissions being miniscule, the country is committed to climate action. The country intends to communicate that climate resilient, sustainable, and equitable development are its priorities.</p>
      <p>The enhanced NDC of Eswatini comes at an opportune moment as the country is developing a new National Development Plan (NDP), National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Adaptation Communication and revising its National Development Strategy (NDS). The revision of NDC allowed the country to take cognizance of the recent findings on the gaps and needs related to global climate action. Analysis of the first NDCs submitted to the UNFCCC by the parties suggests that though ambitious, the global efforts would fall well short of the goals of the Paris Agreement to keep the temperature increase well below 2oC. As per the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C released by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2018, even a half-degree of rise in global temperature will have profound impacts on the sea level rise, biodiversity and increase frequency and intensity of extreme weather events<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Furthermore, since the submission of NDC in 2015, there has been considerable improvements and progress in technologies, policies, partnerships, data, and stakeholder engagement for climate action globally, including in Eswatini. Eswatini uses this opportunity to incorporate the current realities and progress made by the country to revise its NDC targets and roadmaps so as to ensure greater alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Eswatini’s enhanced NDC communicates the country’s intent and ambition towards achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. It provides accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of NDCs as per Katowice decisions<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The country, while cognisant of the fact that climate change affects all sectors of the economy, has prioritised some sectors and measures as detailed below.</p>
      <h3>2. Eswatini’s Nationally Determined Contribution</h3>
      <p><strong>The enhanced and more ambitious NDC of Eswatini represents a progression beyond the 2015 NDC by adopting an economy wide GHG emissions reduction target of 5% by 2030 compared to the baseline scenario<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and help achieve a low carbon and climate resilient development. This economy wide emission reduction can increase to 14% with external financing and this translates to 1.04 million tonnes fewer GHG emissions in 2030 compared to a baseline scenario.</strong></p>
      <h3>3. Adaptation Contribution</h3>
      <p>Eswatini has achieved significant progress in overall socio-economic development which is visible through economic growth, improvements in health, educational outcomes, greater access to energy, and, improvement in water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) including associated infrastructure. However, climate change impacts felt by communities and ecosystems are reversing the development gains achieved till now. There is an urgency to act now as evidenced by AR6 IPCC report. Investing in adaptation will help reduce the effects of climate change that are felt by the country today. Additionally, cost of adaptation to climate change now can prove to contribute towards the outright avoidance of adverse impacts of climatological hazards and related disasters, which will be much less costly than disaster relief and response.</p>
      <p>Based on review of national assessments<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, a risk mapping exercise and stakeholder consultations, five sectors (Agriculture, Water, Health, Ecosystems and Biodiversity, and Infrastructure) were prioritized for adaptation action. Furthermore, this revised NDC has enhanced and strengthened its prior goals from 2015 by adding additional measures for sectors and incorporated a new sector, which is the infrastructure sector. Eswatini’s adaptation contribution across all sectors includes finalization and implementation of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and enhancing governance and legal framework through the development of a national climate change bill.</p>

      <h3>4. Mitigation Contribution</h3>
      <p>The Kingdom of Eswatini submitted its INDC in 2015 in support of the Paris Agreement’s goals to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The first NDC communicated non-GHG based targets and since then, progressive measures have been taken to increase ambition to curb GHG emissions level.</p>
      <p>The revised NDC of Eswatini represents a progression beyond the 2015 NDC by adopting several mitigation measures in the sectors of energy (including transport), waste, industrial processes, and product use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sectors. This provides a clear basis for the enhanced ambition of Eswatini to mitigate climate change impacts through the implementation of concrete actions that have been identified across key sectors. Most of the mitigation measures identified across sectors have been aligned with the new policies and strategies that are listed further and also lead to sustainable development co-benefits.</p>
      <p>As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Eswatini will fully utilize the enhanced ambition instruments under Article 6, increase her focus on energy and mobility under the provision on cooperative approaches in Article 6.2 and on targeting adaptation benefits for rural communities, specifically around food and water security. Where possible, Eswatini shall also utilize the provisions under the non-market approaches in Article 6.8. Eswatini recognizes the urgent need for climate action as articulated in AR6 IPCC report.</p>
      <p>Key contributions of Eswatini to the Paris Agreement</p>
      <p>The new and enhanced mitigation contributions of Eswatini for all sectors include:</p>
          <p>4.1 Energy and transport</p>

      <h3>5. Cross-cutting areas for action</h3>
      <p>Climatic factors have affected Eswatini in multiple ways, exposing its population to problems ranging from food insecurity and livelihood loss to epidemics and mortality. However, these impacts are not equal as population segments are disproportionately affected by them. Eswatini has recognized several such vulnerable groups such as women, LGBTQI, rural population, elderly, disabled and youth to name a few. The interests of these vulnerable groups are protected through a series of cross cutting actions.</p>

            <p>Eswatini is not a major contributor to the global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and yet remains vulnerable to climate change impacts. It is experiencing increase in annual average temperature, variation in precipitation, higher occurrence of hot days and cold nights, increase in frequency of extreme events like floods, droughts, and storms. These impacts felt by communities and ecosystems are reversing the development gains achieved till now. There is an urgency to act now as evidenced in the AR6 IPCC report. Investing in adaptation will help reduce the effects of climate change that are felt by the country today. Additionally, the cost of inaction will be too high with negative consequences to society, environment and the economy.</p>

The process was aided through data collection, review of national policies, strategies, roadmaps and validated through consultations with stakeholders in Eswatini. Separate teams of local and international consultants were involved across sectors under the oversight of the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs (MTEA) and Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MEPD). The review and recommendations were discussed through several meetings and capacity building sessions including with gender, disaster and youth experts and representatives. The findings were validated by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and relevant stakeholders at the national and sub-national level. A high-level validation with stakeholders conducted and the enhanced NDC was thereafter approved by the Cabinet of Eswatini.</p>
            <p>Eswatini is currently developing an implementation plan for its enhanced NDC for the sectors and targets indicated above through international support. The implementation plan will act as an overarching framework that will serve as the base for the country to implement projects and activities across sectors and also assist in identifying the support required in the long-term.</p>
            <p>As the overarching objective of the NDC revision process was to further strengthen Eswatini’s commitment towards climate action in addition to the previously identified measures and priority sectors in the first NDC.</p>

            <p><i>Geography:</i> The Kingdom of Eswatini is a land locked country located between Mozambique and South Africa in the south-eastern part of the African continent and covers a total area of 17,364 km2. It has four agro-ecological zones classified based on the types of soils and weather patterns, namely Highveld, Middleveld, Lowveld and the Lubombo plateau that make up to 33%, 28%, 31% and 8% of the country’s total area respectively.</p>
            <p>Climate: Eswatini’s climatic profile varies from tropical to near temperate with summers lasting from October to March, characterized by rainfall that peaks in January. January receives the highest rainfall with long-term average monthly downpour of 134.4mm while the lowest recorded is in July at 19.9mm.</p>
            <p>Demography: The total population of Eswatini is estimated at 1,093,238 with 51% representation from women. A total of 76.2% of the population is classified as rural in the country with great dependence on urban areas for employment.</p>
            <p>Economy: Agriculture is the primary economic sector of Eswatini and is the main source of income for the majority of the population. The secondary sectors comprise of construction and manufacturing (majorly beverages), whereas services constitute the tertiary sector.</p>
            <p>Eswatini’s economy shows marginal growth over the last decade (2010-20) averaging 2% increase, largely due to the fiscal crisis induced by the global economic meltdown in 2008 and droughts in 2015 and 2016 that directly affected the agricultural output. The economic activities in the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, and mining and quarrying) slightly improved in the subsequent years after 2016 that recorded an expansion of the real GDP from 2.0% in 2017 to 2.4% in 2018. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant contraction of growth.</p>

            <p>Although emissions are not significant compared to those of developed countries, there is potential to reduce emissions and the country has undertaken considerable efforts to achieve this. The first NDC communicated non-GHG action-based targets, Eswatini has taken progressive measures to define economy-wide GHG targets covering all priority sectors. The updated NDC of Eswatini represents its intention to adopt an economy-wide GHG emissions reduction target of 5% and potential to increase to 14% reduction with external financial support in 2030 compared to the baseline scenario. This translates to 1.04 million tonnes fewer GHG emissions in 2030 compared to a baseline scenario<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>Eswatini revised NDC is an indication of the country’s commitment in line with the objectives under Article 2 of the Paris Agreement and will contribute towards achieving the temperature goal agreed under Article 2 paragraph (a) and Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
            <p>Eswatini has enhanced its NDC by adding new sectors and measures. By presenting a more ambitious NDC, Eswatini understands it is significantly contributing to the "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”, consistent with Article 2 of the UNFCCC. Furthermore, Eswatini believes it is contributing to the collective effort to hold "the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”, consistent with Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement. Eswatini’s NDC is compatible with a long-term indicative objective of achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.</p>

      <h4>7. Means of implementation</h4>
      <p>Eswatini can implement the NDC measures conditional to receiving finance, capacity building and technology development and transfer. The estimated total cost of implementing NDC is <strong>$950 million to $1.5 billion</strong>. A full cost estimation will be provided in the NDC implementation plan. Eswatini recognizes that while the cost of climate action is substantial, the cost of in-action is even higher. The country needs technical capacities, technology transfer and skills development for implementing adaptation and mitigation measures. The country recognizes that Indigenous knowledge can help with climate change adaptation and mitigation actions. There is need for awareness raising across sectors and with all stakeholders to implement the NDC.</p>
      <h4>8. Alignment of NDCs with developmental priorities</h4>
  <p>The Paris Agreement presents an opportunity for countries to identify linkages between climate change targets and the larger developmental priorities. In this context, Eswatini has identified potential synergies of NDC targets with SDGs, Sendai framework and the National Development Plan 2019 in this updated NDC, thereby setting forth an innovative and complimentary framework to accelerate climate action. Furthermore, there are opportunities to ensure that the updated NDC can inform the revision of Eswatini’s National Development Plan and National Development Strategy.</p>
  <p>The Kingdom of Eswatini - Updated Nationally Determined Contributions</p>
  <p>Eswatini’s NDC revision process was spearheaded by the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs and supported through NDC Partnership’s Climate Action Enhancement Package (through development partners United Nations Environment Programme, Food and Agriculture Programme, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, International Renewable Energy Agency, World Resources Institute, Commonwealth Secretariat) and United Nations Development Programme Climate Promise project.</p>
