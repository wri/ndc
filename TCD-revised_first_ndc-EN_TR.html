  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>In accordance with Articles 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the Paris Agreement, paragraphs 23 and 24 of decision 1/CP.21 and other relevant provisions of the Agreement, Chad submits its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). It is divided into two main areas with a view to confirming its participation in the collective ambition which aims to maintain the increase in the global average temperature at less than 2°C, ideally at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. , as well as the overall objective of strengthening people's adaptive capacities, resilience and reducing their vulnerabilities to climate change.</p>
<p>This NDC combines the vision of an emerging Chad with a climate-resilient and low-carbon development path, focusing on the water, agriculture/agroforestry, livestock and fisheries as well as cross-cutting axes (capacity building, technologies, precipitation forecasts, risk management, etc.). It emerges from this strategic document that Chad's ambitions have been revised upwards, pending support from the various technical and financial partners in the priority sectors for both mitigation and adaptation to climate change . This strategic document is also aligned with Chad's 2030 vision on the main objective of its axis 4, which is to improve the living conditions of the population and reduce social inequalities while ensuring the preservation of natural resources and the adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p>This NDC provides for the cumulative reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 to 88,350 kt CO2eq (unconditional and conditional measures) with an overall mitigation target of 19.3% compared to the reference scenario. The investment required to implement the NDC mitigation actions is estimated at USD 6,700.2 million.</p>
<p>Thus, the financing needs to respond to the high level of climate risks expected in Chad could amount to more than 375 million USD from 2021 (i.e. on the basis of an estimate of 3% of the Gross Domestic Product) to reach the annual cost of 645 million USD by 2030. On this basis, the projections for the period 2021-2030 could amount to more than 5,002 billion USD. Without neglecting the importance of domestic and private funding sources, international financial contributions from Technical and Financial Partners should play a very significant role.</p>
<p>International priority contributions for adaptation are estimated at around 75% of financing needs, and should amount to more than 281 million USD / year from 2021 to reach more than 483 million USD / year from 2030. It should be noted that the Green Climate Fund Country Program has an estimated budget of US$2,280 billion for eleven (11) adaptation projects by 2030, and that the program only addresses part of the priority sectors identified by this updated NDC. To facilitate the strengthening of climate governance within the government of Chad, the feasibility of implementing a Chadian Climate Fund (CTF) should be explored based on national and international experiences, which could be responsible for mobilizing development opportunities. funding for the implementation of NDC activities and other activities related to long-term climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant economic impact in the country and has contributed to delaying the implementation of planned mitigation and adaptation actions. This pandemic has also amplified the vulnerabilities of rural communities to climate change, particularly those of the most exposed and marginalized people, including women.</p>
<h2>1. Intro</h2>
<p>The Government of Chad presents here an update of its 2015 NDC for the period 2120-2030, in accordance with Articles 4.2 and 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, paragraphs 23 and 24 of decision 1/CP.21 and other relevant provisions of the Agreement.</p>
<p>To respect its international climate commitments, Chad, through this update of its NDC, confirms its participation in the collective ambition which aims to maintain the increase in the global average temperature at less than 2°C, ideally at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as well as the overall goal of building adaptive capacity, building resilience and reducing vulnerabilities to climate change.</p>
<p>The CDN, the National Communications as well as the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) are the main means of communication that the Government uses to inform the international community of the actions it intends to take to deal with climate change. The preparation of the first NAP was carried out jointly and contributed to the process of updating this NDC.</p>
<p>The adaptation contribution incorporates data collected during national and provincial consultations and climate change vulnerability analysis studies in sensitive priority sectors that have identified the main climate risks and impacts, vulnerable groups , affected sectors and proposals for adaptation measures. It also reflects the co-benefits of adaptation interventions, as well as potential synergies with the Rio conventions and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)/2030 Development Agenda.</p>
<p>This NDC has been designed to integrate gender equality into its planning, supporting the inclusion of gender-sensitive adaptation and mitigation measures that have been recommended through consultations at national and regional levels and that contribute to more effective climate action.</p>
<p>It is also based on the analysis of the convergence of the priorities of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Chad to develop the country program in terms of interventions in the priority sectors both for mitigation and for adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p>The conclusions and recommendations of this NDC reflect the contributions of all the stakeholders concerned at the national and regional level which have made it possible to take stock of the various climate risks faced by the communities of the different regions of the country which have expressed their concerns and provided options to improve their well-being and income-generating activities to increase their resilience to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<h2>2. Context of the Chad NDC</h2>
<p>Chad is one of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the world. About ¾ of its territory is desert. It is also recognized as being one of the hottest countries and is counted among the countries most vulnerable to climate variability and change. This is because Chad is particularly affected by low yields and declining harvests, which are exacerbated by weak forecasting, preparedness, response and adaptation.</p>
<p>The country ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1993 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2009<strong>.</strong> As part of the commitments made to the UNFCCC, the country developed two National Communications on climate change respectively in 2001 and 2012, its National Adaptation Action Program (NAPA) in 2010, and submitted its first NDC in 2015. Through its NDC, and the ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, Chad is committed, within the framework of the new dynamic of international cooperation on climate change, to contributing to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. greenhouse and building resilience to climate change.</p>
<p>The first NDC of 2015 combined the vision of an emerging Chad by 2030 with a climate-resilient and low-carbon development path, focusing on the water, agriculture/ agroforestry, livestock and fisheries. The NDC also indicated the main priorities in terms of adaptation, both sectoral priorities (Water, Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries) and cross-cutting (capacity building, technologies, rainfall forecasts, risk management, etc.).</p>
<p>The NDC anticipated the implementation of a dozen programs in the field of adaptation and a dozen priority programs in the mitigation sector. The estimated opportunities to achieve the NDC targets included: (i) Adaptation: USD 14.17 billion in total over the 2030 commitment period, including USD 11.38 billion to meet the conditional target (with contributions from the international community), (ii) Mitigation: USD 7.063 billion in total over the commitment period, including USD 6.54 billion to meet the conditional target. The total cost of implementing the NDC amounted to USD 21.23 billion, including USD 17.92 billion to achieve conditional targets. In the medium and long term, the Green Climate Fund will provide a substantial part of the financing for the implementation of Chad's NDC.</p>
<p>Based on studies carried out as part of the National Adaptation Action Program (NAPA), the 2015 NDC defined cross-cutting and sectoral adaptation priorities. This NDC aims to update these priorities. In terms of adaptation, the update should build on the work done under the NAP process as the latter would provide a mechanism to improve capacity and ownership in planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring of adaptation. The NAP process will also improve individual and institutional capacities to deliver climate services for adaptation planning in priority sectors.</p>
<p>In accordance with the guidelines of the Government of Chad's development policy, Chad aspires to become an emerging country by 2030. In this regard, the Government intends, among other things, to strengthen environmental protection , mitigation of GHG emissions and adaptation to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has had a significant economic impact in the country and has contributed to delaying the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions. This pandemic has also amplified the vulnerabilities of rural communities to climate change, especially those of the most exposed and marginalized people.</p>
<h2>2.1 New elements contributing to the update</h2>
<p>According to the orientations of the policy of the Government of Chad mentioned above, the national commitments in terms of climate change are included in the policy and strategy documents drawn up defining the strategic axes that should guide the government's action in this area.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the NDC, important policies and strategies have been adopted to support the country's efforts in the fight against climate change, such as the "Vision 2030, the Chad we want". From this Vision stems the 2017-2021 PND, which is a model for integrating the “climate change” dimension into a development policy. The National Investment Plan for the Rural Sector of Chad (2016 - 2022), the National Strategy to Combat Climate Change (2017), the National Environmental Policy (2017) currently being validated, the action for the implementation of the National Framework for Climate Services in Chad (2016-2020) and the Master Plan for the Development of Renewable Energy in Chad (2018) are other frameworks for the implementation of this vision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following the adoption of the new framework for action in Sendai, a National Capacity Building Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction, Emergency Preparedness and Response (2015-2020) was developed by the Ministry of Territorial Administration and the Ministry of Economy and Development Planning with the technical support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). It recommends establishing a specific National Strategy for Disaster Management Preparedness that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of existing structures in the event of an emergency operation</p>
<p>The process of updating the NDC thus offered an opportunity to assess, adjust and strengthen national strategies and align them with national priorities. It was also an opportunity to better integrate climate issues into national development planning and to reassess mitigation and adaptation options for the years 2020-2030 while strengthening stakeholder participation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the PNA was initiated by the government of Chad in October 2019 and will eventually cover 19 provinces in the Sahelian and Sudanian zones. This initiative will address short, medium and long-term climate change risks, establish policy and capacity building efforts, integrate climate change into planning, budgeting and development and catalyze investments for adaptation to climate change.</p>
<h2>2.2 CDN refresh process</h2>
<p>The Ministry of the Environment, Fisheries and Sustainable Development, through the Department of Environmental Education and the Fight against Climate Change, which is responsible for developing the NDC, organized national and regional consultations to prepare the NDC 2021, using participatory and interactive approaches with stakeholders. These include various public and private institutions, regions, traditional leaders and local communities, technical services of decentralized sectoral ministries, higher education, heads of civil society organizations, representatives of the private sector, heads of press organs, associations of producer organizations, women's organizations, young people and municipal authorities, technical and financial partners.</p>
<p>The objective of these consultations was to inform and consult stakeholders on the two ongoing processes related to climate change. These consultations were designed to validate the analysis of the climate change situation in Chad, gather additional information, and discuss and agree on strategic priorities for adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>The regional workshops took place in the Provinces of Logone Occidental (Moundou), Logone Orientale (Doba), Tandjilé Est (Lai), Mayo kebbi Est (Pala) and Moyen-Chari (Sarh), Province of Hadjer-Lamis (Massakory), Kanem (Mao), Bahr el Gazal (Moussoro) and Lac (Bol), Province of Guerra (Mongo), Batha (Ati), Ouaddaï (Abéché) and Biltine (Biltine). These workshops were very important not only to sensitize and involve local authorities and communities in the process, but also to gather additional information on mitigation and adaptation from stakeholders in the regions. The process was completed by a national pre-validation workshop, which allowed national and regional stakeholders to validate and complete the data used in the analyzes and priority actions of the NDC in terms of adaptation and mitigation.</ p>
<p>The development of the NDC also contributed to training and technical capacity building in terms of learning to use a GHG trajectory modeling tool (LEAP). The CDN scenarios and impacts of the mitigation measures considered were developed based on the national GHG inventory updated in 2021 for the 2010-2018 period and the GACMO (Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Model) tool. .</p>
<p>The update of this NDC took into account the priorities defined in the NAPA, the first NDC, and the analyzes of the vulnerability of climate-sensitive sectors. In addition, an analysis was carried out on the basis of national studies, reports, strategies and plans, in order to integrate the most recent information in terms of climate risks and vulnerabilities and main vulnerable sectors. As such, the 2017 national climate change strategy is important in the context of the revised NDC because it elaborates the main key sectors impacted by climate change. In this context, the Country Program of the Green Climate Fund Chad 2019, is also important as it provides assessments of vulnerability and vulnerability impacts by sector.</p>
<p>An analysis of recent studies on gender and climate change and on gender mainstreaming was carried out and showed the weak understanding of the concept of gender by the different actors and the links with climate change. It is also important to note the role of women in ecological management and the inequalities in access and control of resources that exacerbate their vulnerability remain little recognized.</p>
<p>This update has mainly benefited from the support of the Climate Action Transparency Initiative (ICAT), UNDP (FEM-PNA Project, Climate Promise and Global Support Program for the PNA, PAG-PNA ), the NAP Global Network and the European Union, and the coordination of the NDC Partnership.</p>
<h2>2.3 Chad NDC Vision</h2>
<p>Still keen to contribute to the fight against climate change under the Paris Agreement, Chad remains firmly committed to increasing its ambitions compared to its previous commitments, which has been reflected in the vision of this updated NDC for mitigation and adaptation and is expressed in these terms:</p>
<p>"Support by 2030, a diversified economy that is resilient to climate change as part of a development trajectory that emits less greenhouse gases for the well-being of the Chadian population, while protecting ecosystems and an economy resilient to climate change, capable of anticipating, managing and reducing environmental and climatic risks and extreme phenomena, while reducing social inequalities and ensuring the preservation of natural resources.”</p>
<p>This vision is in line with Chad's Vision 2030 ''an emerging middle-income country, driven by diversified and sustainable sources of growth and added value''. It is also aligned with the main objective of its axis 4, which is to improve the living conditions of the population and reduce social inequalities while ensuring the preservation of natural resources and adaptation to climate change (Vision 2030 ).</p>
<p>In this context, it is important to guide and bring together political, institutional, technical, scientific and financial initiatives to deal with climate change. More specifically, promote energy efficiency and renewable energies, including solar, wind and biogas, in all sectors. Encourage sustainable land and forest management to reduce emissions from degradation and deforestation. As well as to integrate gender dynamics throughout the process of developing and implementing NDCs.</p>
<h2>3. National circumstances</h2>
<p>Chad, the fifth largest country in Africa, is a landlocked country in Central Africa that includes the Saharan, Sahelian and Sudanese zone. The relief is varied and contrasting. It consists mainly of a vast basin bordered by mountain ranges.</p>
<p>The hydrographic domain remains dominated by rivers and lakes, the permanent ones of which are the Chari and the Logone. These rivers form the Chari-Logone system with a catchment area of 600,000 km².<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup> </a> Lake Chad, part of a vast inland sea, is the largest open water body in Chad.</p>
<p>The tropical climate of Chad is divided into the major bioclimatic zones, Saharan in the North, Sahelian in the Center, Sudanese in the South. As far as biodiversity is concerned, the main plant formations from North to South are <i>the following</i>: (i) shrub steppes with thorns and annual herbaceous; (ii) tree and shrub to thorny and non-thorny steppes and annual herbaceous; (iii) wooded and shrubby combretaceous savannahs with annual and perennial herbaceous plants and (iv) wooded savannahs and open forests dominating a perennial herbaceous layer.</p>
<p>Chad shares its biomes with neighboring countries: (a) Sahara desert biomes with Libya, Sudan and Niger; (b) Sahelian biomes with Sudan, Niger and Nigeria; (c) dry savannahs with Sudan, Central African Republic (CAR), Cameroon and Nigeria and (d) wet savannahs with CAR and Cameroon. </p>
<p>The structure of the country's economy, which remains very undiversified, is strongly dominated by the primary sector (oil, agriculture, livestock and mining). The agricultural sector, which is limited to food crops, especially cereals, and cash crops, especially cotton, sugar cane and gum arabic, is very vulnerable to climatic hazards. The private sector consists of only small and medium-sized enterprises operating mostly in the informal economy.</p>
<p>The effects of vulnerability in the agriculture, forestry and land use sector will manifest themselves in significant reductions in yields and production (-10 to -25%) of food crops ( millet, sorghum, maize) due to water deficits caused by successive droughts, high temperatures, late onsets of the rainy season and/or early cessations. In addition, vulnerability due to poor irrigation, desertification, and land and forest degradation has significant effects on the entire food chain of the Chadian population.<a href="#fn2" class= "footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and heat waves have a severe impact on the natural resources from which Chad's mostly rural population derives its livelihoods.</p>
<p>Chad has a population estimated at nearly 15 million inhabitants in 2018. It is made up of 50.6% women, 78.1% rural people and 50.6% young people under the age of 15. years. Women and young girls in Chad have unequal access to resources (education, land) in a general context of socio-cultural constraints: customs, norms and traditions weigh on women and hinder the effective application of their rights<a href=" #fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In addition, women are not in the same position as men to face the negative impacts associated with climate change and do not have the same capacities and possibilities to face them, which makes them more exposed or vulnerable.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2>3.1 Climate change and variability in Chad</h2>
<p>The evolution of the climate in Chad, like other countries in the Sahelian region, has experienced ruptures in recent decades, marking very distinct phases. This evolution is measured in relation to the climate profile which will highlight the main observed and future climate hazards, the vulnerable groups and sectors, the impacts and the adaptation capacities which are the components of vulnerability.</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Annual variation in rainfall in the Sahel</h4>
<p>Before the 1970s, the region went through a succession of wet years, then was severely affected by two decades of drought (1970-80). From the 1990s, rainfall has generally improved but is characterized by strong irregularities (figure 1).</p>
<p>Figure 1. Annual rainfall variation index in the Sahel between 1900 and 2010.</p>

<p>Source: Washington University, NOAA, NCDC. Global Historical Climatology National Data (2012)</p>
<h4>3.1.2 Climate profile in Chad</h4>
              <p>Chad's dry tropical climate located between isohyets 0 and 1,200 mm in three major bioclimatic zones (Figure 2) is highly contrasted:</p>
<p>The Saharan or desert zone in the north, which covers the north made up of the provinces of Borkou-Tibesti-Ennedi (BET) and the northern parts of the provinces of Kanem and Batha, i.e. 47% of the national territory. With a rainfall of less than 100 mm/year, only oasis agriculture and camel and small ruminant breeding can be practiced there. The season which lasts two months in the North (almost zero in the far North).</p>
<p>The Sahelian zone in the center of the country covers 43% of the national territory. With a rainfall of between 100 and 800 mm/year, it presents significant contrasts between the arid northern part (Saharo-Sahelian climate with annual rainfall of between 100 and 200 mm) and the Sahelo-Sudanian zone in the south characterized by rainfall between 600 and 800 mm/year.</p>
<p>The Sudanian zone in the south of the country, between isohyets 800 and 1,200 mm, represents only 10% of the national territory. However, it concentrates almost half of the Chadian population. The subhumid tropical climate - the rainfall in the Sudano-Guinean zone in the extreme south of the country is greater than 1,200 mm - allows the practice of a wide variety of agricultural production and the breeding of many species (cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, poultry).</p>
<p>Figure 2. Three major bioclimatic zones of Chad</p>

              <p>Source: PANA, Ministry of Environment and Water, 2009.</p>
<h4>3.1.3 Rainfall</h4>
<p>It should be noted that after the wet years of 1950 and 1960, the drop in precipitation began towards the end of the 1960s, in line with what was observed in the Sahel, and intensified during the 1970s and 1980s before experiencing a slight remission from the 1990s and 2000s. The evolution of the national rainfall index shows high variability from 1965 with a downward trend with repercussions on natural and human systems.</p>
<p>The length of the agricultural season is also subject to significant inter-annual variability, with a marked trend towards shorter seasons. Another trend is the increased frequency of prolonged dry spells during the rainy season</p>
<h4>Temperatures</h4>
<p>In Chad, the interannual evolution of the temperature index from 1950 to 2019 shows a continuous rise in temperature from the beginning of the 1980s to the present day. Like the globe, the 1990s and 2000s were the hottest since meteorological records began in Chad. Maximum temperatures increased by an average of 1.1°C across the country. Minimum temperatures would have increased by 2°C over the period 1951-2010 and maximum temperatures by 1°C, with high values between 2002-2010 (Mbaiguedem, 2012).</p>
<h4>3.1.5 Observed extreme weather events</h4>
<p>In Chad, the resurgence of extreme meteorological phenomena (droughts, floods, heat waves, violent winds, etc.) is one of the highlights of climate change recorded in recent decades in Chad (PANA, 2010). The drought episodes of the 1970s and 1980s caused a drop in agricultural and animal production, loss of human life and biodiversity, degradation of plant cover, migration of people and livestock and food insecurity (PANA , 2010).</p>
<p>The drought that prevailed during the 2009/2010 campaign affected nearly 2 million people, with a decrease in the cereal harvest of about 31% compared to the five-year average and more than 50% in the Sahelian zone (FAO, 2011).</p>
<p>Climate impacts are significant on the major hydrographic systems of the Lake Chad and Niger basins, natural, agro-sylvo-pastoral, fisheries and human systems. They involve dysfunctions of the agricultural seasons, disturbances of the biological cycles of crops and a drop in cereal production.</p>
<h4>3.1.6 Climate projections</h4>
<p>Climate models show that it is very likely that temperatures in Africa will increase during the 21st century by an average of 3 to 4°C, or 1.5 times more than the global average. This temperature increase will be greater in arid continental regions.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The results on the projections of changes in precipitation and temperature on the basis of 29 global models of the CMIP6 experiment by 2030 compared to the most optimistic scenario (RCP4.5 or representative profile of the evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations) and the pessimistic scenario or RCP8.5, indicate a significant increase in surface temperatures relative to the period 1981 to 2010. According to these RCPs, the average temperature in Chad would increase by an average of + 1°C for the optimistic scenario, particularly in the northern part of the Sahel and the entire Saharan zone. For RCP8.5 (pessimistic scenario), this increase would be around +1.5°C by 2030 in the far north of the country. With regard to precipitation, projections indicate generalized increases throughout the country. This increase, which varies from 10 to 20%, will be greater in the northern parts of Chad.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> </p>
<p>At the N'Djamena station, the temporal evolution of temperatures from 1950 to 2100 relatively compared to the climatological reference of 1981-2010 shows an increase in temperatures around + 1 ° C in 2030 and at + 2 ° C in 2100.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>However, these climate projections, in particular those relating to precipitation, present many uncertainties (AGRHYMET, 2015). Between global factors, regional and continental dynamics, the climate of Sahelian Africa is subject to strong uncertainties.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup> </a></p>
<h2>3.2 Policies, strategies and institutional frameworks</h2>
<p>With regard to the Government's development policy, Chad, which aspires to become an emerging country by 2030, intends, among other things, to strengthen environmental protection, adaptation to the effects of climate change and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, given the country's high exposure to the effects of climate change, the Republic of Chad has ratified several international agreements on climate change and has also developed several policies, strategies and initiatives aimed at effectively combating the adverse effects of climate change. .</p>
<p>Protection of the environment is enshrined in the Chadian Constitution (Articles 47 and 52 and Law No. 014/PR/1998. National climate policy is entrusted to the Ministry in charge of the environment - whose denomination is currently Ministry of the Environment, Fisheries and Sustainable Development - through the Department of Environmental Education and the Fight Against Climate Change (DEELCC).</p>
<p>The Chadian Government, by signing and ratifying respectively in 1992 and 1993 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and by ratifying its Kyoto Protocol in 2009 and the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 , is committed to making the medium and long-term changes necessary to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to adapt to the adverse effects of these climate changes through the development of more resilient and adapted strategies . Within this framework and in accordance with the commitments, Chad has developed and implemented policies, strategies and plans that address the impacts of climate change:</p>

<h2>4. The updated mitigation contribution</h2>
<p>Chad's updated NDC is based on updated elements, in particular an inventory of GHG emissions covering the period 2010 to 2018, the year chosen as the reference year. The objective set in the conditional scenario is to reduce GHG emissions by 19.3%, in 2030, compared to a reference scenario. Chad intends to achieve this conditional objective while pursuing development efforts and making sustainable use of its available resources.</p>
<h2>4.1 Reference situation</h2>
<h4>4.1.1 CDN Coverage</h4>
<p>The NDC covers GHG emissions from the national territory for the energy, agriculture, forestry and land use sectors as well as waste. Emissions linked to industrial processes have not been taken into account due to a lack of data. Nevertheless, they are considered low given that no emitting process has been identified omitted for non-energy uses of fuels and cold appliances.</p>
<p>The revision of Chad's NDC has made it possible to review the inventory of GHG emissions over the 2010-2018 time series by applying the latest IPCC guidelines on the basis of available statistics. Emissions from new sectors, such as fugitive emissions, CH4 and N2O emissions from wood combustion, emissions from wastewater treatment, etc. have been included.</p>
<p>The GHGs covered are CO2, CH4 and N2O. The applied GWPs are those of IPCC AR4. The 2006 IPCC guidelines are applied to all sectors covered.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 Inventory of GHG emissions</h3>
<p>The updated GHG emissions inventory covers the period 2010 to 2018 and covers the sectors of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Energy: power generation, industry, transportation, housing, fugitive emissions from oil and gas extraction and charcoal production,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agriculture,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land use, land use change and forestry,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment of solid and liquid waste.</p>
                </li>
</ul>

                  <p>Figure 3. GHG emissions (kt CO2e – sinks included)</p>
<p>According to inventory results, GHG emissions including sinks increased from 49,320 kt CO2eq to 74,090 kt CO2eq between 2010 and 2018, an increase of 50%.</p>

                  <p>Figure 4. Share of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2018</p>
<p>Agriculture is the main GHG emitting sector in Chad and accounts for approximately 95% of GHG emissions.</p>
<h3>4.1.1 The baseline scenario</h3>
<p>According to this reference scenario, GHG emissions would increase from 74,090 to 84,960 kt CO2e between 2018 and 2030. This projection was developed using the GACMO tool taking into account the following sectors:</p>

<p>The energy sector</p>
<p>The energy sector covers the sectors of energy production and transformation as well as uses in the various sectors. The energy balances of the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), which are consistent over the period 2010 to 2018, were used to estimate the GHG emissions of this sector. For biomass consumption, only CH4 and N2O emissions are considered in this sector, in accordance with IPCC guidelines. Indeed, CO2 emissions related to biomass consumption are accounted for in the LULUCF sector.</p>
<p>Chad's economy is largely dependent on oil production (20% of GDP and more than 80% of goods exports in 2019) which began in 2003 and allowed the country to experience a period of rapid growth until in 2014 (average annual growth rate of 13.7%). Fugitive emissions related to oil extraction are estimated and represent approximately 30% of energy emissions in 2018. As this industry is recent and modern, emission factors from developed countries have been applied. On the other hand, fugitive emissions related to charcoal production are also estimated based on the 2019 refinement of the IPCC guidelines and represent 18% of energy emissions.</p>
<p>For electricity production, the electricity access rate was around 11% in 2020, concentrated mainly in N'Djamena and certain urban areas. According to the Emergency Plan for Access to Electricity 2021-2023, the objective for 2030 is to achieve a rate of access to electricity of 53% throughout the territory. The activity and associated emissions linked to the production of electricity therefore increase rapidly in the reference scenario.</p>
<p>In final consumption, the transport sector is the main sector consuming petroleum products.</p>
<p>The residential/tertiary sectors mainly consume wood and charcoal.</p>
<p>The manufacturing industry is underdeveloped and mainly consumes biomass and electricity.</p>
<p>In the absence of official projections, annual growth rates between 4 and 6% are applied depending on the sector, based on estimated changes in GDP and population over the period . For electricity production, the growth rates follow the electricity connection objectives of the population.</p>
<p>Industrial processes</p>
<p>The manufacturing industry occupies a marginal place and is mainly based on the production of beer and soft drinks, the production of sugar, and the ginning of cotton.</p>
<p>Only emissions related to energy consumption are counted for this sector. Emissions related to non-energy uses of fuels and leaks of fluorinated gases are not estimated and are considered negligible.</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>Chad's GHG emissions in the agriculture sector are mainly linked to livestock activities (79% of sector emissions, 50% of which are due to enteric fermentation and 29% to manure) and the burning of savannas (13% ). They also come from rice growing activities (2%), the use of fertilizers and the burning of agricultural residues (3%).</p>
<p>Emissions due to livestock were estimated from statistics provided by the Central Bureau of General Livestock Census available for the period 2010 to 2020 with a Tier 1 method and default emission factors IPCC.</p>
<p>Emissions related to agricultural production (rice cultivation, burning of crop residues and direct and indirect N2O emissions from cultivated soils) were also estimated with data on areas, production and fertilizer consumption provided by the statistical services of Chad. Assumptions on the burning of residues on cotton and cereals were inspired by references on practices in Mali, rice cultivation was assumed to be rainfed with a growth period of 183 days from May to October. Emissions are then calculated by applying the Tier 1 methods of the 2006 IPCC guidelines. As for GHG emissions related to the burning of savannahs, the data on areas and biomass burned are directly retrieved from the FAO site to which the methodologies of the 2006 guidelines have been applied.</p>
<p>Forest and Land Use</p>
<p>Chad is subdivided into two very distinct zones: the desert zone in the north with almost non-existent vegetation cover and the Sudano-Sahelian zone which has a vegetation cover of approximately 128,400,000 ha.</p>
<p>Emissions/removals related to the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector were estimated based on the 2006 IPCC guidelines. Land cover changes were estimated from maps produced by the US Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science (USGS EROS) center which presents land evolution over the period 1975-2015. The characterization of the different types of land use (forests, savannas, etc.) in terms of productivity is based on data collected from the Land Cover Database (BDOCS) of P-SIDRAT. Estimates of wood consumption also come from work carried out as part of the SIDRAT program.</p>
<p>The sink in the LULUCF sector, estimated at -5,144 kt CO2eq in 2010, fell to -641 kt CO2eq in 2018 due to a high rate of deforestation and deforestation.</p>
<p>Waste</p>
<p>The quantities of waste produced in 2030 are estimated on the basis of a historical average per capita of approximately 88 kg/capita/year (World Bank data). This waste generation rate is considered stable until 2030.</p>
<p>The reference scenario foresees the extension of the same waste management practices currently observed: approximately 86% of the quantities of waste go to open landfills considered as shallow unmanaged landfills and the rest is treated by open fires.</ p>
<p>Under these conditions, the emissions associated with the treatment of solid waste, calculated by applying the 2006 IPCC guidelines, would increase from 326 kt CO2eq in 2018 to approximately 546 kt CO2eq in 2030, i.e. an average increase of 5% per year over the period.</p>
<p>For wastewater, the quantities of BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) produced are estimated at nearly 293 kt per year in 2030 compared to nearly 222 kt in 2020. The extension of current management practices leads to emissions of GHG of 814 kt CO2eq in 2030 compared to 552 kt CO2eq in 2018.</p>
<p>The cumulative emissions of the three sub-sectors (open fires, storage and water treatment) are thus estimated at approximately 1,360 kt CO2eq in 2030 compared to 878 kt CO2eq in 2018, i.e. an average annual increase of 4.3% compared to year.</p>
<h2>4.2 Mitigation goals</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 Approach</h3>
<p>Chad presents mitigation objectives in terms of reduction compared to the reference scenario, by 2030. The impact of the actions considered, in terms of reducing GHG emissions, is estimated from the GACMO tool. The actions mainly cover the power generation, industrial, residential, fishing and forestry sectors.</p>
<p>Two scenarios are considered for emissions projections: an unconditional scenario (where only nationally funded actions are implemented) and a conditional scenario (with additional mitigation actions covered by international support). </p>
<h3>4.2.2 Results</h3>
<p>The unconditional scenario results in a minimal reduction of 0.5% in 2030 compared to the reference scenario.</p>
<p>Most of the actions have been taken into account in the conditional scenario, which allows for a 19.3% reduction in GHG emissions compared to the reference scenario, in 2030, i.e. 16,372 kt CO2eq of emissions avoided in 2030 and 88,350 kt CO2eq of emissions avoided cumulatively between 2018 and 2030. This scenario is very ambitious given that the reduction in emissions is based solely on the energy sectors (electricity production and energy efficiency) , on increasing the carbon sink and very slightly on the waste sector.</p>

<p>The actions considered are described below:</p>
<p>The energy sector</p>
<p>The projects considered by 2030 in the scenarios are for the power generation sector:</p>
<p>Unconditional scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The construction of a 210 MW gas-powered turbine plant located in N'Gouri in the Lac Province;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consideration of 2.2 MW of wind turbines;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installation of improved drying ovens for the fishing sector (150 chokor-type ovens and 200 improved drying racks) allowing savings of 30 to 40% in wood consumption compared to a traditional oven for smoking fish.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conditional scenario (additional actions):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The construction of two biomass-fired power plants (2x15 MW each) in Moundou and Sarh;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of the electricity network interconnection project between Chad and Cameroon, which would make it possible to use hydropower energy (40 MW);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The construction of several large-scale photovoltaic power plants for a total of 240 MW in the very short term (2025) and 400 MW by 2030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The construction of solar-diesel hybrid power plants for a total of 60 MW (several projects are under study in Sarh, Moundou and Pala);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The construction of a solar power plant with storage with a capacity of 65 MW in the city of N'Djamena;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The construction of wind power plants, for a total of 100 MW, in Bol, Mao, Amdjarass, Faya, Biltine, Fada, Guéréfa, Iriba, Kalaite and Arada;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extension of the use of improved ovens and drying racks for the fishing sector (1,500 chokor-type ovens and 2,000 improved drying racks) allowing the reduction of wood consumption for this activity.</ p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of energy efficiency, the actions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The distribution of 3,000,000 low-energy LED lamps to households as well as 100,000 LED office bulbs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ambitious plan to distribute 3,000,000 improved wood stoves and 1,500,000 charcoal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient production of 300,000 tons of charcoal to improve production efficiency and therefore reduce wood consumption and CH4 emissions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Finally, the avoidance of CH4 by installing 10,000 digesters on farms to reduce fossil fuel consumption is considered in the conditional scenario.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of these actions by 2030 will make it possible to avoid the emission of 6,900 kt CO2eq compared to the reference scenario, of which 1,979 kt CO2eq are accounted for in the energy sector, 4,909 kt CO2eq are accounted for in forestry (due to the reduction in wood consumption in residential and in industry) and finally 12 kt CO2eq with the avoidance of CH4 emissions.</p>
<p>This commitment could be reinforced in the future by the implementation of mitigation actions in the transport sector, in particular through the construction of railway lines, the development of public transport in cities and the improving the energy efficiency of the vehicle fleet, in particular by banning the import of vehicles that are too old. This sector was not considered in the actions, for lack of precise data on the vehicle fleet and consumption at the national level. A more precise inventory of this sector should be carried out in order to be able to assess the actions to be implemented as well as their impact in terms of mitigation.</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>Agriculture is the most emitting sector in Chad. Nevertheless, no planned action (apart from the installation of digesters on farms, accounted for in energy) directly aims to reduce agricultural emissions, the main objectives being linked to the country's food security and the development of agricultural productivity.</p>
<p>The priority for this sector should therefore focus on refining activity data and practices that will make it possible to refine the inventory of GHG emissions and thus be able to establish a detailed action plan according to the priorities defined in national level.</p>
<p>Forest and Land Use</p>
<p>Reforestation and reforestation actions are underway or/planned to improve the carbon sink by 2030. As part of the Bonn Challenge, Chad has committed to reforesting a total of 5 million hectares by 2030, in particular shrub savannas in the Sahelian zone (3.5 Mha) and trees in the Sudanese zone (1.5 Mha). Protection actions to avoid deforestation (877,000 ha) and restoration are also planned (50,000 ha) in the action plan for 2030.</p>
<p>The impact of these actions is estimated at additional absorptions of 9,400 kt CO2eq in 2030, to which are added 4,909 kt CO2eq of avoided emissions linked to energy efficiency actions.</p>
<p>Waste</p>
<p>The establishment of a national waste management policy is crucial in terms of public health and the development of the country. The conditional scenario takes into account the establishment of waste treatment plants in major urban centers with an estimated reduction impact of around 10% of emissions related to solid waste management. The priority is still to improve knowledge of the sector and to set up effective actions for the collection and treatment of waste, such as the recovery of the methane generated in managed landfills. Wastewater treatment (especially in urban areas) and the introduction of waste composting are also to be studied.</p>
<h2>5. The updated contribution on adaptation</h2>
<p>Adaptation is a key element in Chad's NDC, given its extreme vulnerability to climate change, resulting from the combination of great poverty of the majority of the population, high risks of drought and floods which are added to frequent conflicts. Chad is considered by the international scientific community as one of the "hotspots" of climate change in the world. Indeed, Chad was classified as the country most at risk, among the 186 countries assessed, as part of a study on climate vulnerability. <a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
      <p>Aware of these challenges, the Government of Chad clearly emphasized the need for adaptation in its first NDC, which defined several priority sectors and measures. Since then, the government of Chad has developed a number of strategies and action plans that reinforce actions aimed at establishing an economy and a society that are more resilient to climate change. These include, “Vision 2030, the Chad we want” and the National Development Plan 2017 – 2021, the National Strategy for the Fight against Climate Change and the National Environmental Policy (2017).</p >
<h2>5.1 Status of adaptation in Chad</h2>
<p>The priority sectors for intervention and the groups vulnerable to climate change described in the first NDC produced by the NAPA were taken up and slightly updated during the second national communication and the Green Climate Fund Country Programme. It should be noted that Chad does not have complete and detailed studies of the vulnerabilities of the population and socio-economic sectors. This task has been identified as a priority in the UNDP project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) “Chad National Adaptation Plan (PNA)”</p>
<p>The update of this NDC, in terms of actions for adaptation, took place in parallel and in close collaboration with the development of the first NAP. This made it possible to carry out consultations at national and regional level and to update the list of the main climatic hazards, vulnerable sectors and strategic priorities in terms of adaptation, taking into account as a starting point the priorities defined in the NAPA, the first NDC, the national climate change strategy and the GCF country program, which are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>The importance of adaptation to climate change in national and sectoral policies is manifested by the integration into national plans and strategies of aspects related to the sustainable management of natural resources, the effective coordination and convergence of initiatives in climate change, the integration of adaptation into national planning and into policies and strategies at central, regional and local levels. As well as the effective application of relevant and easily understandable weather and climate services and information.</p>
<h2>5.2 Climate risks, and vulnerable sectors</h2>

<h2>5.3 Priority intervention areas for adaptation</h2>
<p>Priority adaptation options have been identified for each focal area based on national priorities, consultations with national and regional stakeholders, as well as consultation in the regions with communities and regional officials and the analysis of the vulnerability of sectors sensitive to the climate of Chad. The studies used a combination of literature review, focus group discussions and individual interviews. The following graphs summarize the priority measures for each area of intervention, ranked according to a score compiling the evaluations of the effectiveness, feasibility, cost/benefit ratio as well as the acceptability of each measure.</p>
<p>The following areas of intervention have been classified according to the results of the consultations with stakeholders: Agriculture and Livestock, Environment and Forests; Water and sanitation ; Renewable Energies; Gender and Social Protection; Education and communication; Risk Management, Infrastructure and Spatial Planning; and Fisheries Resources and Aquaculture. It should be noted that the number and order of priority intervention areas has changed compared to the first NDC. Stakeholders also identified an additional number of priority intervention areas, namely, the intervention areas of environment, gender and social protection and education.</p>
          <p><img width="606" height="406" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-7.png"></p>
          <p>Areas of intervention agriculture and livestock: Being a landlocked country, its economy is essentially based on agriculture and livestock which are sectors very sensitive to climate change. The agricultural sector, which is dependent on climatic conditions, is strongly affected by climate change (fall in harvests, shrinking of cultivation areas, drought, etc.). The limited capacities of local populations to adapt to climate risks are also a major obstacle to building their resilience.</p>
<p>The priority adaptation options considered represent a number of measures aimed at becoming more resilient. They revolve around the reduction of threats by intervening on hazards, in particular, among other things, by promoting improved varieties of crops, which offer higher and more stable yields and better resistance to the climate. Other priority options in agriculture and livestock also include, development of agroforestry and development of the value chain approach of agro-pastoral value chains, improvement of the overall efficiency of livestock, investment in improving pasture management, regulating pastoral mobility and diversifying water and soil conservation techniques.</p>
          <p><img width="606" height="292" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-8.png"></p>
          <p>Areas of intervention environment and forests: The rise in temperatures and the resurgence of drought episodes could influence the renewal of forest systems and could lead to irreversible deforestation. Protected areas cover 12% of the territory but are subject to strong pressure: pastoral pressure, poaching, fishing, demographic pressure, overexploitation of natural resources, bush fires and agriculture. In Chad, there is a significant lack of environmental data, which limits the possibility of assessing impacts.</p>
<p>The adaptation measures identified will support forest restoration and sustainable forest management, for example, through the promotion of non-timber forest products, which will benefit biodiversity conservation and reduce deforestation, as well as the impact of the floods, and will contribute to the development of income-generating activities for the communities</p>
          <p><img width="607" height="337" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-9.png"></p>
          <p>Areas of intervention water and sanitation. Current projections of water availability in Chad have high uncertainty in both GHG emission scenarios. The combined effects of reduced precipitation and high temperatures lead in some cases to the drying up of certain watercourses and drinking water installations. When floods occur, they increase the pollution of surface and ground water. On the other hand, floods cause groundwater pollution through poorly protected catchment works. In urban areas, most people need latrines that are not or poorly sealed and dug at depths exceeding the level of the water table. Access (or lack of access) to water, sanitation and hygiene strongly contributes to Chad's structural vulnerability and affects the country's health and nutrition situation. In terms of education, deficiencies in water, sanitation and hygiene also penalize the development of human capital.</p>
<p>The water, sanitation and hygiene options provided will improve health and contribute to the economic benefits of communities. These measures will improve communities' access to basic water and sanitation and support climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure. As well as the sustainable use, protection and management of surface and groundwater resources, and the resilient management of solid and liquid waste.</p>
          <p><img width="607" height="236" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-10.png"></p>
          <p><strong>Renewable energy areas of intervention.</strong> National energy consumption is 96.5% dominated by the consumption of wood fuels, the productivity of which remains highly dependent on the climate and its variations.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This overexploitation of wood resources for household uses combined with climate change has led to deforestation exceeding 90 % of the national heritage and an extinction of certain plant species from 1970 to the present day.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> As the main source of energy for cooking is wood or charcoal, the vulnerability of wood energy can have a considerable impact on households that are dependent on it, especially the poorest population.<a href="#fn13 " class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Priority options identified include measures that will promote and support the use of renewable energy, such as biogas and solar energy, which will help reduce the dependence of communities on firewood. This will help reduce deforestation and land cover degradation, and will have positive economic, public health, health and environmental benefits.</p>
          <p><img width="600" height="263" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-11.png"></p>
          <p><strong>Gender and social protection intervention areas.</strong> Limited education, cultural barriers, unequal social responsibilities and low participation of women in decision-making are at the root of their vulnerability and hinder their ability to adapt to climate change<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> . Women are not in the same conditions as men to face the negative impacts associated with climate change and do not have the same capacities and possibilities to face them, which exposes them or makes them more vulnerable.</p >
          <p><img width="611" height="331" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-12.png"></p>
          <p>The priority options identified to address these issues include, among others, the facilitation of access to land for women, the development of social safety nets or the development of a disaggregated national database.</p>
<p>Areas of intervention risk management, infrastructure and land use planning. Climate change will have significant impacts on human settlements and economic production sites, particularly in densely populated urban areas such as N'Djamena, Moundou or Sarh. Urban centers are already faced with episodes of flooding during heavy rains or river floods. Chad is highly dependent on road transport, but the country's road density ranges between 6 and 40.5 km per 1,000 km2 and many unpaved roads become impassable during the rainy season, many villages and rural communities finding themselves isolated.</p>
<p>Priority options will improve community preparedness and include the integration of risk reduction measures such as early warning mechanisms for floods and droughts. Adaptation measures will benefit urban settlements by reducing their vulnerability to the effects of extreme weather events through risk mapping, climate-resilient building codes and infrastructure rehabilitation.</p>
          <p><img width="604" height="303" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-13.png"></p>
          <p>Areas of intervention education and communication.</p>
<p>The education sector is critical to advancing all of Chad's development goals. It is impacted directly and indirectly by climate change, particularly following extreme phenomena (floods, heat waves, etc.) which can lead to the death of schoolchildren and teachers or have an impact on school infrastructure. According to UNICEF's Children's Climate Risk Index (IRCE), Chad is the second country in the world where children are most at risk from climate change.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef " id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Therefore, and through the priorities identified for this area of intervention, the expected result is that adults, young people and children improve their knowledge and information while encouraging them to participate in school activities focused on climate adaptation and resilience to contribute to solutions to climate change.</p>
          <p><img width="607" height="267" alt="image" src="img/TCD-NDC1-14.png"></p>
          <p>Areas of intervention fisheries resources and aquaculture: Variations in rainfall patterns and water use have an impact on freshwater fishing activities. Climate variability has a greater effect on fishing activities and the production of artisanal spirulina. Consequently, irregular rainfall leads to low productivity of fisheries and wadis producing spirulina. The fishing and aquaculture sector is essentially small-scale and is faced with recurrent droughts, the clogging of rivers and lakes due to erosion in the watersheds, consequences of accelerated deforestation. The integration of climate change in this sector is very low due to the insufficient quality of economic analyzes and in-depth assessments of the risks and vulnerability of the fisheries sector.</p>
<p>The priority options identified include measures that will contribute to better adaptation of communities to climate impacts and, at the same time, to the improvement of their livelihoods, such as the practice of amplified fishing or the stocking of dams and retention basins.</p>
<h2>6. Adaptation-mitigation cross-cutting issues and priorities</h2>
<h2>6.1 Gender dynamics</h2>
<p>Two studies have been carried out recently, the first focusing on gender and climate change in Chad<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, the second on mainstreaming gender in the NAP process<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, and have stressed the importance of integrating the gender component in climate change programs in Chad.</p>
<p>The two studies also highlighted the poor understanding of the concept of gender by the various actors (national decision-makers, and some women themselves) and of the links with climate change. This deficit is partly explained by a lack of training on inclusive development approaches but also the lack of development initiatives that rely on the systematic collection of data disaggregated by sex and age. The role of women in ecological management and the inequalities of access to and control of resources which aggravate their vulnerability, for example, remain little recognized. Both studies focused on three cross-cutting priorities that will be important to advance in the two components of the NDC, adaptation and mitigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strengthen the capacities of the Ministry in charge of gender and other ministries involved in the fight against climate change to exercise their catalytic role in the integration of gender in the formulation, budgeting and planning systems for adaptation gender sensitive,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systematize the implementation of the gender approach in the development of climate policies, strategies, plans, programs and projects for sustainable development,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure women's access to decision-making spheres through support that provides education, information and economic empowerment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>6.2 Spatial planning</h2>
<p>Land-use planning emerged as an important cross-cutting element for the planning and effectiveness of the NDC's mitigation and adaptation priorities.</p>
<p>Effective land-use planning is an important part of a successful response to climate change, as it can both influence greenhouse gas emissions and be a cost-effective adaptation strategy on a national scale, regional or local. Land use planning choices significantly influence the ultimate impacts of climate change and can increase resilience to the impact of climate change through development location, mix and design. Currently, more and more countries are integrating consideration of climate risks into risk-sensitive planning decisions, especially in urban areas.</p>
<p>Indeed, decisions about land use and infrastructure can either decrease or increase risk significantly, especially in cities. If investments in infrastructure, housing and other facilities have been made in unsafe locations, the risk is blocked for decades and it would be much more expensive to correct it than to prevent its creation. It will be important to further integrate risk reduction measures that take into account the effects of climate variability and change, with the help of early warning mechanisms for floods and droughts to improve community preparedness. Adaptation actions will benefit urban settlements by reducing their vulnerability to the impacts of extreme weather events through risk mapping, climate-resilient building codes and infrastructure upgrades. Measures will also include improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings, green spaces and parks that will have beneficial effects on mitigation.</p>
<h2>6.3 Measures generating co-benefits</h2>
<p>One of the important elements that emerged from the consultations in Chad is the importance of emphasizing and prioritizing actions that create synergies and co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation. Indeed, by 2030, Chad will implement several climate change adaptation measures that will translate into benefits in terms of mitigation, especially nature-based solutions (NBS) which will have the advantage of strengthening resilience to climate change, contribute to GHG capture and also help achieve other SDGs. These actions will also have beneficial effects on the biodiversity, health and socio-economic well-being of communities.</p>
<p>As such and given the vulnerability of agriculture to changes in rainfall patterns in the country, the promotion and support of SBNs relating to sustainable and climate-smart agriculture as well as agroforestry which such as cropland nutrient management, tree planting in cropland and conservation agriculture offer significant mitigation returns with a number of considerable adaptation benefits with environmental and socio-economic benefits -economic in terms of improved biodiversity and ecosystem services as well as increased agricultural production, improved livelihoods, food security and nutrition.</p>
<p>Livestock management and sustainable grazing and feeding practices can have benefits in terms of improved soil fertility, vegetation cover and grassland ecosystems, which will have co-benefits of climate adaptation and carbon sequestration. These actions will also be combined with manure management practices and composting, which will have mitigation effects by reducing methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.</p>
<p>Other adaptation measures with mitigation benefits will support forest restoration and sustainable forest management, which will benefit biodiversity conservation and reduce deforestation, and the impact of flooding, which will contribute to carbon sequestration and help communities set up alternative income-generating activities.</p>
<p>Integrating adaptation and mitigation into access to water, sanitation and hygiene will improve health and contribute to the economic benefits of communities. Adaptation measures will improve communities' access to basic water and sanitation and support climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure. Mitigation measures will also be incorporated in terms of wastewater treatment and the use of solar energy to extract water, which can reduce emissions.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that stakeholders identified the renewable energy focal area as important for adaptation as promoting and supporting the use of renewable energy, such as biogas and solar energy, will generate co-benefits by reducing methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure and reduce the dependence of communities on firewood, which will contribute reduce deforestation and the degradation of vegetation cover, which, in addition to increasing carbon sequestration, is an important element in reducing vulnerability to climate change and will have economic, public health, health and environmental benefits.</ p>
<h2>6.4 Contributions to the Rio Conventions and SDGs</h2>
<p>The majority of the adaptation and mitigation measures of this NDC are in perfect synergy with Chad's commitments in the three Rio conventions on biodiversity, climate change and desertification, as well as with the sustainable development and its commitments under the Bonn Challenge to restore 5 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030.</p>
<p>In this context, the priority adaptation measures identified as well as the mitigation actions promoted by this NDC will support the restoration of forests and lands, tackle the causes of biodiversity loss, land degradation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Thus, and through nature-based solutions, these actions will contribute to the objectives of neutralizing land degradation by 2030. At the same time they will promote the conservation, management and restoration of several ecosystems, as well as as interventions that call for the protection and conservation of biodiversity and the restoration of ecosystems and their services, which are part of the objectives of the strategic plans of the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>Some of the response measures will also generate synergies and co-benefits, particularly in terms of mitigation, activities generating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which will be carried out in the agricultural sectors. , forestry and other land uses (AFOLU).</p>
<p>The NDC also generates synergies that can also generate co-benefits for several SDGs, particularly with regard to activities that are linked to themes such as drinking water and sanitation, agriculture, resilience, infrastructure, land use and management, forests, ecosystems, environment, disaster risk reduction, awareness, employment, well-being, resource efficiency and adaptive capacity, which are linked to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 15.</p>

<p>The implementation of the actions covered by the conditional scenario requires international financial support to the tune of 6,285,385,669 USD, or 94% of the investments necessary to achieve the national objective.</p>
<h2>7.2 Financing needs for adaptation measures</h2>
<p>The assessment of the achievements of the 1st NDC reveals that the funding for adaptation committed during the period 2016-2020 is insufficient in relation to the needs. The revised NDC also considered a greater number of priority sectors and measures.</p>
<p>Given the lack of studies and quantified data to determine the socio-economic impacts of climate change on the different sectors in Chad, it was difficult to estimate the cost of adaptation interventions. Thus, the funding needs of this NDC have been estimated as a range.</p>
<p>The corresponding minimum amount is estimated using a “top-down” approach that estimates adaptation needs as a percentage of GDP. This is based on global simulations of adaptation needs developed by UNEP (<i>top down</i> approach taken from the <i>Adaptation Gap Report</i>), as well as several reports and studies who estimated that adaptation costs could be equivalent to an annual loss of between 1.5 and 3% of GDP in Africa by 2030.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18" ><sup>18</sup></a> As Chad is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world, the estimate of 3% of GDP was chosen.</p>
<p>According to this approach, the financing needs to respond to the high level of climate risks expected in Chad could amount to more than 375 million USD from 2021 (i.e. on the basis of an estimate of 3% of the Domestic Product gross) to reach the annual cost of USD 645 million by 2030 (Table 7). <strong>Based on these annual simulations, financing needs for the period 2021-2030 could amount to more than USD 5.002 billion.</strong></p>

<p>The proposed funding requirements of USD 5.002 billion for the revised NDC are more conservative compared to the adaptation funding requirements included in the 2015 NDC which totaled USD 14.169 billion. This value is kept as the maximum value of adaptation costs for the period up to 2030. It derives from the extrapolation of the costs of two national programs in Chad focusing on resilience: Global Alliance for Resilience (AGIR) (PRP_AGIR) and the National Rural Sector Investment Plan (PNISR) covering the period. The extrapolation of the costs of these two programs was made by applying an annual population growth rate of 3.5% and an annual inflation rate of 2.9%10 to arrive at the amount of 14.169 billion USD .</p>
<p>The PNISR, with a total amount of 2,301.7 billion FCFA, is based on five programs, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sustainable management of natural resources and adaptation to climate change (243.6 billion FCFA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of infrastructure and equipment in the rural sector (1,277.1 billion FCFA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries sectors (360.1 billion FCFA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>food and nutritional security, gender and strengthening the resilience of rural households (94.6 billion FCFA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>research, adoption and dissemination of technologies, human and institutional capacity building (326.3 billion FCFA).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall cost of the PRP amounts to 1,241 billion FCFA for a period of 5 years until 2020 and its priorities are based on the following 4 pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pillar 1: improve the social protection of the most vulnerable communities and households to secure their livelihoods (415.7 billion FCFA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pillar 2: strengthen the nutrition of vulnerable households (249 billion FCFA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pillar 3: sustainably improve agricultural and food productivity, the incomes of the most vulnerable and their access to food (564 billion FCFA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pillar 4: strengthen the governance of food and nutritional security (12 billion FCFA).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The real figures for the costs of adaptation by 2030 would be in the range between 5 and 14 billion US Dollars. More detailed studies of cost estimates of adaptation needs will be prepared by the NAP-GEF.</p>
<p>Priority international support required</p>
<p>Without neglecting the importance of domestic and private funding sources, international financial contributions from Technical and Financial Partners should play a very significant role. Given that Chad is among the least developed countries, international priority contributions are estimated at around 75% of financing needs, and should amount to more than 281 million USD / year from 2021 to reach more of 483 million USD / year from 2030.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Green Climate Fund Country Program has an estimated budget of 2.280 billion USD for eleven (11) adaptation projects by 2030, and that the program only addresses a part priority sectors identified by this updated NDC.</p>
<p>Climate Investment Plan</p>
<p>Given that projected funding needs require large-scale investment, and which the Government of Chad cannot make available on its own, a specific approach is required in terms of accessing financial resources to achieve NDC objectives of this country.</p>
<p>An investment plan will define the priorities and the financing program necessary for the implementation of the various measures. Thus, a list of project concepts will be developed with funding proposals that will be submitted to funding sources. In this context, Chad will need a combination of domestic budget allocations, external funding sources and private sector funding.</p>
<p>Among other things, the climate investment plan will estimate resource needs and propose complementary financial mechanisms and instruments needed to finance the NDC. As well as mechanisms to encourage or engage the private sector to promote resource mobilization. It will also contribute to proposing a mechanism for monitoring the investments made for the implementation of the NDC and to propose a framework for the annual report of the funds mobilized and the investments made for the implementation of the revised NDC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, and in order to strengthen climate governance within the government of Chad, the feasibility of implementing a Chadian Climate Fund will be explored based on national and international experiences who could be responsible for mobilizing opportunities funding for the implementation of NDC activities and other activities related to long-term climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<h2>7.3 Capacity building and technology transfer</h2>
<h4>Attenuation</h4>
<p>In order to reduce the inherent institutional, technical, political and financial risks, this activity must be subject to the strengthening of the technical capacities, research and coordination of the stakeholders. Chad encourages Parties listed in Annex 1 of the Convention to technically and financially support the establishment of NDC monitoring and evaluation initiatives in Chad. In particular, support for the establishment of the National MRV Agency involving the various sectors will enable the establishment of a national transparency system covering the regular updating of GHG inventories, the definition and reporting of indicators for monitoring mitigation actions and the supports needed and received.</p>
<p>Capacity building in the field of national statistics and the definition of mitigation actions at the sectoral level. This is particularly the case in the context of the energy transition (energy accounting, forecasting, programming of energy management actions, monitoring and evaluation of the actions implemented, the definition of new sectoral action plans, etc.) but also other sectors such as agriculture, LUCF (with the establishment of a forest inventory and the monitoring over time of the impact of actions) and waste treatment. Capacity building of stakeholders in the implementation of carbon market mechanisms provided for in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement as well as technology transfers.</p>
<p>Chad's need is high for capacity building and technology transfer in addition to land, security and climate risks and financial risk. Also the attractiveness of the country for the private sector is very low due to multiple and complex socio-economic and geopolitical elements. Local capacities in the value chain of sustainable energy projects are insufficient and statistical data on energy resources are limited.</p>
<p>Given the government's priorities for renewable energy, rural electrification and energy efficiency ("The Energy Policy Letter (LPE) (2018 - 2030), the level of development of the energy sector sustainable energy in Chad but also the urgency to intervene in the electricity sector, the following actions present an urgent need for capacity building and technology transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strengthening the electricity sector:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improving the legal and regulatory framework necessary for the proper functioning of the sector;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restructuring of the SNE and revision of its fundamentals (pricing policy, recovery policy);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the cost of production per kWh;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development and improvement of electricity distribution and transmission networks across the country;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthening of institutional capacities to enable the existence of an efficient energy market;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased access to energy for all populations;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development of electrification in main and secondary towns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of electrification in rural areas through decentralized solutions such as mini-grids or solar kits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop alternatives to firewood for cooking;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of the share of renewables in Chad's energy balance;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increase in the contribution of renewable energies to the electricity network;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of renewable energy solutions for rural electrification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of electrification projects by renewable energies of a social nature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthening of local technical skills on renewable energies and improvement of market control procedures;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for actions relating to technologies and innovation in the field of Energy Efficiency:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strengthening of support procedures and development of the EE market, domestic and industrial;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of Improved Cookstoves and Clean Cooking;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of local technical skills on EE and improvement of market control procedures;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost required for capacity building actions is estimated between 20 and 30 million USD, with international support.</p>
<h4>Adaptation</h4>
<p>In order to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience, adaptation needs affect human, institutional and technical capacity building, financial support and technology transfer.</p>
<p>Human and institutional capacity building needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inform, educate and communicate on climate risks and adaptation technologies (development of the capacities of populations to react);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen the skills of actors (especially women and farmers) on new technical itineraries within the framework of intensified and sustainable production methods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support research and encourage technology transfer between research organizations and agro-sylvo-pastoral actors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the institutions to define adaptation priorities according to the socio-economic sectors according to the needs of the population and promote intersectoral coherence, particularly during the development of the National Adaptation Plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizational capacity building needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Civil society organizations and local communities in the country need to be strengthened in terms of:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of a vision and strategy that allow better management of the concerns of disadvantaged and/or vulnerable groups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of appropriate organizational structures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of fundraising mechanisms and resource management systems (financial and human).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Needs for technical organizational capacity building:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Local authorities need capacities in participatory formulation and implementation of strategies, programs and projects for adaptation to climate change that are integrated into municipal plans for sustainable development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stakeholders need knowledge and know-how in terms of:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construction of protective structures against the impacts of climate change;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and operationalization of more ecological modes of production and consumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of vulnerable species;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and development of systems for alerting and preventing disasters resulting from climate change;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge and know-how on the active methods of participatory research (deconcentrated administrations), associations, NGOs, researchers and other development actors - this training should focus on the adaptation of vulnerable groups to the impacts of climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Capacity building needs for access to information and knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Elaboration and implementation in each country of a communication strategy between the administration coordinating the climate change component and the other development actors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of a national awareness, information and training program on climate change or support for existing programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support to be given to all relevant actors to participate in global, regional and sub-regional forums related to climate change;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to inform and train the leaders and facilitators of provincial, local and community forums on themes related to the adaptation of vulnerable groups to climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Research and development capacity building needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support to identify and develop research-action projects in the field of policy and regulation to increase the necessary know-how in voluntary carbon trading, the mobilization of the resulting financing and the mechanisms transparent and fair benefit-sharing arrangements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>7.4 Policy mechanisms and institutional arrangements</h2>
<p>Adaptation and mitigation require the active participation of different actors and responses at multiple levels. The consequences of climate change are felt at the local level etc, therefore, make the active participation of stakeholders at the local, national and regional levels essential to promote the adaptation decisions that are taken during the UNFCCC negotiations.</ p>
<p>Chad already has a number of structures and an institutional framework to implement the Paris Agreement. In particular, within the Ministry in charge of the environment, the Department of Environmental Education and the Fight against Climate Change (DEELCC) is designated as the national focal point for the Paris Agreement, and provides a coordination of climate action with all public and private actors, especially with all sectoral ministries (Ministry in charge of agriculture, Ministry in charge of livestock, Ministry of public health, Ministry in charge of mines, Energy and Petroleum, Ministry in charge of Infrastructure and Transport, Ministry in charge of Regional Planning, Ministry in charge of Trade and Industry, Ministry of National Education, Ministry in charge of higher education, Ministry in charge of information and communication, Ministry in charge of women and social affairs, Ministry in charge of national defence).</p>
<p>The High National Committee for the Environment (HCNE) created by Decree No. 822/PR/MET/95 of October 20, 1995, is another important body in this institutional system, since it oversees the implementation effective application of the articles of the Constitution relating to the protection of the environment; effective integration of environment and development; and the concrete implementation of Sustainable Development policies. The HCNE also has an arbitration function in the event of conflicting options between development priorities and environmental protection.</p>
<p>During the consultations for the update of the NDC, it was noted an urgent need to improve and especially to operationalize and ensure the stability of the institutional framework and the focal points to avoid a dispersion of energy in the governance climatic. This action is essential to guarantee the sustainability of the implementation of climate actions and projects</p>
<p>These actions to strengthen the institutional framework must also strengthen the role of non-state actors and local communities in the formulation and implementation of policies and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Further study of the institutional framework with a view to recommending practical structures is required.</p>
<h2>7.5 Use of voluntary cooperation provided for in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement</h2>
<p>For the preparation and implementation of mitigation projects, the country intends to seek international assistance from the various available sources, in particular development aid agencies, bilateral and multilateral financial institutions, financial mechanisms for the UNFCCC as well as the use of market-based mechanisms for sustainable development in Article 6.4 but also non-market-based approaches which are provided for in Article 6.8 of the Paris Agreement.</p>

It is bordered to the north by Libya, to the south by the Central African Republic, to the east by Sudan and to the west by Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon.</p>
<p>The evolution of demographic indicators shows that the population of Chad recorded in 2009, which was 11.1 million inhabitants (density: 8.6 inhabitants/km²) would reach 15.1 million inhabitants in 2018. According to the results RGPH2, women and young people under 15 remain in the majority with a proportion of 50.6%, the average annual intercensal growth rate is estimated at 3.6% (including refugees). On the social level, the proportion of the Chadian population living below the monetary poverty line fell from 55% in 2003 to 46% in 2011 (ECOSIT3, INSEED, 2014). The Human Development Index (HDI) over the past five years, (0.392 in 2015) is up 5.9% compared to 2012. In 2015, Chad committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2016-2030) under the aegis of the United Nations. The country is divided into 23 regions, 63 departments and 250 municipalities.</p>
<p>Chad's climate is Saharan in the North, Sahelian in the Centre, Sudano-Sahelian in the South and Sudanian to sub-humid in the far South. There are six (6) climatic zones (DREM, Meteorological Service; 2009): the Saharan zone (&lt; 100 mm); the Saharo-Sahelian zone (100 to 200 mm); the Sahelian zone (200 to 600 mm); the Sahelo-Sudanian zone (600 to 800 mm); the Sudanian zone (800 to 1200 mm) and the Sub Guinean zone (&gt;1200 mm). The duration of the rainy season is two months in the North and more than six months in the extreme South of the country. Throughout the territory, the minimum and maximum average temperatures are respectively between 19 to 21°C and 34 to +37°C.</p>
