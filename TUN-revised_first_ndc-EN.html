  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>Tunisia had submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 16 September 2015. Following Tunisia’s ratification of the Paris Agreement on October 17, 2016, and the entry into force of the Agreement on November 4, 2016, the INDC had become the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Tunisia.</p>
  <p>The present submission of the updated Nationally Determined Contribution, prepared in accordance with the provisions of Decision 1/ CP.21, as well as other relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement, allows <strong>Tunisia to communicate more ambitious mitigation and adaptation efforts to further contribute to the global response to the threat of climate change aimed</strong> at achieving the global objectives under Article 2 of the Paris Agreement. The updated NDC is also fully in line with Tunisia’s economic and social development priorities, mainly through :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
  <p>The alignment of the NDC with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goals 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 17.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>Significant co-benefits in terms of economic growth, job creation and poverty alleviation.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>The integration of gender aspects into the two components of mitigation and adaptation to climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Objectives and approach</h3>
  <p><strong>In terms of mitigation</strong></p>
  <p>The updated mitigation component of Tunisia’s Nationally Determined Contribution is prepared in accordance with Articles 4.2 and 4.9 of the Paris Agreement, and paragraph 24 of decision 1/CP.21, as well as other relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement and its Rulebook to facilitate information on clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of Tunisia’s mitigation commitments.</p>
  <p>This part of the updated NDC also complies with the recommendations of decision 4/ CMA.1, which refers to paragraph 28 of decision 1/CP.21 on mitigation and lists in its Annex I all the Information to be provided to enhance the clarity, transparency and understanding of mitigation actions of nationally determined contributions.</p>
  <p>The updated NDC raises Tunisia’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> greenhouse gas mitigation ambition, in accordance with Article 4.3 of the Paris Agreement, through an increase of the national<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> carbon intensity reduction target to 45% by 2030<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, compared to its 2010 level. This upward revision of the Tunisian ambition will also be accompanied by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>The increase in the scope of the target (in accordance with the recommendations of article 4.13 of the Paris Agreement), which now exhaustively includes all sources of emissions and removals;</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>The low-carbon scenario (LC) will impose a downward trajectory leaving behind the peak of net emissions, which occurred well before 2020. Tunisia will therefore be perfectly in line with the recommendation - although optional in the short term for developing countries - to cap emissions (Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement);</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>The trajectory of decreasing net emissions will continue after 2030, putting Tunisia in the launching path of the long-term objectives pursued by the Paris Agreement.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>In terms of adaptation</strong></p>
  <p>The general objective of adaptation of the updated NDC aims to «promote a Tunisia resilient to climate change, having significantly reduced vulnerabilities and strengthened the adaptive capacity of its ecosystems, its population, its economy, its territories, and having resolutely operated the necessary transformations, able to ensure a model of socio-economic development inclusive and sustainable and thus, can participate in the construction of a more resilient world”.</p>
  <p>To achieve this objective, the adaptation component of the updated NDC is based on a «Resilience Star», designed as a framework to support Tunisian actors and their technical and financial partners, both public and private.</p>
  <p>In order to strengthen its resilience in all its different sectors, namely food, water, ecological, social, economic, territorial and health resilience, as well as resilience to natural disasters, the adaptation component of the NDC is based on both a paradigm shift and a cross-sectoral approach. The paradigm shift is based on a new way of acting in a more global and cross-cutting framework of adaptation that concerns all parts of the nation and its development.</p>
  <p>The implementation of the updated NDC is based on a prioritized action plan, with vertical actions that address specific sectoral issues and cross-cutting actions to better address cross-sectoral challenges. To this end, the sectoral actions affect the six most vulnerable sectors: water resources, agriculture, ecosystems, the coastline, health and tourism, while taking into account three new cross-cutting areas of intervention: gender, land use planning and natural disaster risk reduction.</p>

  <h3>Financing needs</h3>
  <p>The implementation of CDN with its two components mitigation and adaptation, will require the mobilization of significant financial resources, estimated at about 19.3 billion US dollars over the period 2021-2030 including 14.3 billion US dollars for mitigation, 4.3 billion US dollars for adaptation and 0.7 billion US dollars for capacity building actions.</p>

  <h2>1. THE UPDATED TUNISIAN CONTRIBUTION TO MITIGATION</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Objective</h3>
            <p><strong>Type of target</strong></p>
            <p>Reduction in carbon intensity compared to a baseline year (%)</p>
            <p><strong>Target year</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Reference year</strong></p>
            <p>2010</p>
            <p><strong>Overall target of the NDC</strong></p>
            <p>Tunisia’s contribution to mitigation is materialized by a <strong>45% decrease in its carbon intensity in 2030 compared to 2010</strong> (Figure 1).</p>
            <p><strong>Unconditional and conditional mitigation targets</strong></p>
            <p>Tunisia’s unconditional contribution corresponds to a <strong>reduction in carbon intensity of 27%</strong> in 2030 compared to that of the reference year 2010 (Figure 1). This is far above the first NDC where the unconditional effort would generate only 13% reduction in carbon intensity. The conditional contribution allows for an additional <strong>18% reduction</strong> in carbon intensity in 2030 compared to the 2010 base year</p>

            <p>Figure 1: Carbon intensity trajectory according to the conditional and unconditional contribution of Tunisia over the period 2010-2030</p>
            <p><strong>Fairness and ambition</strong></p>
            <p>As a non-Annex 1 Party to the UNFCCC, Tunisia will effectively contribute to the global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Tunisia considers that its contribution is fair and ambitious, for four main reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Thanks to its total contribution (unconditional and conditional), Tunisia raises its ambition, aiming at a reduction of its carbon intensity in 2030 by 45% compared to that of 2010.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The national effort (unconditional contribution) leads to a 27% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 compared to that of 2010, or nearly 60% of the target.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Tunisia is committed to reducing its carbon intensity significantly below that of 2010, although it has participated in only 0.07% of global emissions in 2010.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Thanks to its total contribution, by 2030, per capita emissions would reach 2.4 tCO<sub>2</sub>/ capita, while global emissions in 2010 already reached 7 tCO<sub>2</sub>/capita.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Coverage and scope</h3>
            <p><strong>Geographic coverage</strong></p>
            <p>Entire national territory</p>
            <p><strong>% of national emissions covered by the mitigation effort</strong></p>

            <h3>1.3 Financing, capacity building and technology transfer needed to achieve the objectives of the NDC</h3>
      <p><strong>Financing needs</strong></p>
      <p>The implementation of <strong>Tunisia’s mitigation contribution</strong> requires the mobilization of significant financial resources <strong>estimated at around US$14.4 billion</strong> to cover the investment needs of the low-carbon pathway over the period 2021-2030. The sectoral distribution of these resources is shown in Table 1 :</p>
      <p>Table 1: Investment financing needs to support the NDC low-carbon scenario over the period 2021-2030 (millions US$ 2020)</p>

      <p>Approximately US$ 11.8 billion 2020 would be needed in the particularly capital intensive energy sector, or 82% of the financing needs for GHG mitigation objectives.</p>
      <p><strong>National effort and international funding support</strong></p>
      <p>The aforementioned funding requirements necessary to achieve the NDC goal fall into two «categories»:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The national effort concerns the resources to be mobilized at the national level; in order to support Tunisia’s unconditional contribution. This effort has been estimated at US$ 3.3 billion for the whole period 2021-2030 (Table 2); i.e., 23% of the total financing needs accompanying the low-carbon transition 2021-2030 envisaged by the updated NDC of Tunisia. It is worth noting that the national effort now covers all sectors, and not only the energy sector, as was the case in the first NDC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The international support to be mobilized in order to support the realization of the conditional contribution would amount to US$11,1 billion over the period 2021-2030. This support could be mobilized in various forms (concessional lines of credit, grants, direct investments, integration into carbon markets, etc.).</p>

      <p><strong>Use of carbon market mechanisms</strong></p>
      <p>Tunisia considers, moreover, that it is essential that Parties strengthen their voluntary and concerted cooperation to raise the level of ambition of their mitigation and adaptation actions in the context of the implementation of their nationally determined contributions, as provided for in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
      <p>In general, Tunisia wishes to engage in these cooperative approaches on all sources eligible for Article 6 mechanisms, and more particularly to develop electricity production from all renewable energy sources, and to improve its energy efficiency, emission control in the process sector, controlled and environmentally improved waste and wastewater management, as well as measures targeting agriculture and forestry and land use.</p>
      <p>In order to be ready to access the mechanisms of Article 6, Tunisia is actively preparing the experimentation and the application of pilot carbon pricing instruments, notably through the implementation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Carbon taxation systems on the consumption of energy products to feed the Energy Transition</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A crediting system for GHG mitigation in the electricity sector</p>

          <h4>Capacity building</h4>
          <p>The total cost to cover capacity building needs in the area of mitigation has been estimated at about US$744 million over the period 2021-2030, of which the largest portion will be for the energy sector, followed by the AFOLU sector.</p>

          <h4>Access to technology and technological innovations</h4>
          <p>Technology transfer programs will be necessary to allow Tunisia to access the main technological innovation niches related to the low-carbon transition. We can mention without it being exhaustive- several technological innovation niches that can have an important contribution to the low-carbon transition of Tunisia:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The first of these niches concerns the mass development of renewable energy, which includes mainly five main fields: wind (on-shore and off-shore), photovoltaic, concentrated solar power (CSP), biogas and green hydrogen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The choice of the best technologies and energy practices for the building<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> sector.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The participation through international partnerships, into major research on sustainable mobility (electric, hydrogen, etc.), and storage systems, as well as immediate applications on captive fleets (e.g., Post Office, public transport, etc.).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The follow-up of world mutations in terms of work modes, and more particularly in connection with the development of telework.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Active involvement in international partnerships for research and development of mechanisms for managed ecosystems and soils for productive purposes, preservation against all forms of degradation, restoration and increase carbon sequestration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Tunisia also wishes to follow closely the major directions of research to reduce CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from livestock, through policies focused on (a) livestock feeding methods, in parallel with increasing yields, (b) the valorisation, especially energy, of agricultural by-products in general and livestock in particular.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The position on the technological niches in the field of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage (CCS), by integrating into the major research initiatives and industrial applications.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

                <h3>1.4 Planning process</h3>
                <p><strong>Preparation of the NDC update</strong></p>
                <p>The updated NDC has been developed on the basis of broad consultations<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> with the main stakeholders concerned by the climate change issue in Tunisia, including public institutions, private sector, civil society and experts.</p>
                <p>The elaboration of Tunisia’s contribution was also largely based on existing sectoral and horizontal strategies, such as the national strategy on climate change elaborated in 2012, the energy effciency 2030 transition strategy, as well as the sectoral strategies AFOLU, and waste, without forgetting the various sub-sectoral initiatives (e.g., cement, HFC, Nitric acid) by multiplying the installation projects of photovoltaic systems in its treatment plants.</p>

                <h3>1.5 Methodological approaches and sectoral results</h3>
                <p><strong>Inventory methodology</strong></p>
                <p>Inventory conducted in accordance with IPCC 2006 guidelines.</p>
                <p><strong>Global warming potential (GWP)</strong></p>
                <p>GWP values used from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report- AR4 - Climate Change 2007:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>CH<sub>4</sub> = 25</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>N<sub>2</sub>O = 298</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>HFC: GWP variable according to the substances used</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Baseline scenario</strong></p>
      <p>The development of the baseline scenario was based on extensive modelling work developed for the different sectors. The approaches for calculating GHG emissions are directly derived from the IPCC 2006 guidelines. The calculation of emissions is based on the prediction of activity data, which is inferred by simulation, using the following approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Energy sector: The assessment of emissions in the baseline scenario was based on a sector-specific final energy demand modelling approach (including the transport sector) and by energy form using the ENERMED<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> forecasting model.</p>
          <p>Baseline emissions are assessed year by year from 2021 to 2030, using the sectoral approach of the 2006 IPCC guidelines.The updated NDC comprehensively covers these sources of emissions, unlike the first NDC, which did not cover fugitive and the first NDC, which did not cover fugitive emissions or those related to energy consumption of oil and gas fields, gas processing units and Algerian-Italian gas pipeline facilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Industrial processes: The assessment of emissions in the baseline scenario was based on a trend extension of the activity data for the four main sources of emissions in the sector; representing 96% of the sector’s emissions, according to their relationship with GDP and population (for cement and bricks and ceramics), the 2010-2020 trend trajectory for HFCs, and the fixed baseline value for the nitric acid plant, and finally a trend extension of the remaining minimal sources according to their observed relationship with GDP.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Agriculture, Forest and Other Land Use (AFOLU):  The baseline considers a continuation of the trend of the efforts led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and observed during the period 2015-2020, regarding reforestation and conservation measures, as well as the rates of progression of arboriculture. This trend scenario will consolidate the status of net absorber of this source of emissions/ absorptions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Waste:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
          <p>Solid waste : The baseline considers the continuation of the same waste management practices, by burying solid waste in controlled landfills. The baseline considers the continuation -until 2025- of the degassing systems installed in the two CDM projects,<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> based on the same biogas flaring levels as the year 2020.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sanitation/Wastewater Treatment : The baseline considers the continuation -until 2030- of the same sanitation practices observed during the 2015-2020 period, which have registered a significant improvement in their GHG performance compared to the BaU considered in the first NDC.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
          <p><strong>Mitigation scenario</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Energy sector : The NDC scenario is a low carbon scenario based on the implementation of ambitious energy efficiency and renewable energy development programs. The emissions trajectory was first simulated through a modelling method using the ENERMED foresight tool, as for the baseline case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
          <p>Thanks to the LC scenario, emissions from the energy sector would be 34% lower than in the BaU scenario, totalling less than 27 MteCO<sub>2</sub> by 2030, which would represent a 9% decrease compared to 2010.</p>
      <p>The avoided emissions thanks to the LC scenario (difference with the BaU emissions level), according to the top-down approach, would be of the order of 63 MteCO<sub>2</sub> cumulated over the period 2021-2030.</p>
      <p>Thanks to such GHG mitigation results induced by the energy transition policy advocated by the State, the energy sector would reduce its carbon intensity in 2030 by 44% compared to the year 2010; i.e., an average annual decrease of 4.7%.</p>
      <p>The following two figures present the GHG emission reductions respectively by energy efficiency measures by sector and by renewable energy by technology.</p>
      <p><img width="378" height="238" alt="image" src="img/TUN-NDC1-2.png"></p>
      <p>Figure 2: Future GHG emission reduction trajectories from energy efficiency (by sector)</p>
      <p><img width="378" height="238" alt="image" src="img/TUN-NDC1-3.png"></p>
      <p>Figure 3: Future renewable GHG emission reduction trajectories by technology</p>
      <p>Emissions reductions due to energy efficiency over the period 2021-2030 would come first from the rational use of energy in industry (38%). The transport sector comes a close second (37%), mainly due to the organization of urban travel in large cities and the introduction of electric vehicles. The buildings sector accounts for a quarter of the emissions reductions resulting from energy efficiency.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, 45% of the emissions reductions from the energy sector over the entire 2021-2030 period would be achieved based on unconditional national efforts, and 55% through international support required for this purpose.</p>
      <p>All these emission reductions lead to a 38% decrease in the carbon intensity of the energy sector.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Industrial Processes : The emissions trajectory of the process sector was simulated based on models specifically developed in separate Excel spreadsheets for the cement, bricks and ceramics and other process sources sectors.</p>
          <p>For HFCs, the simulation model was developed in Excel spreadsheets using the IPCC calculation models for these substances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
          <p>The LC scenario of the processes sector considers three main actions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Launch of the cement NAMA and carbon pricing instruments, which would include a mitigation program along 4 lines: (i) Energy efficiency, (ii) Renewable energy, (iii) Use of solid waste alternative fuels (RDF), and (iv) Better segmentation of the cement market to lower the clinker/cement ratio.</p>
              <p>The impacts of cement market segmentation on clinker process emissions are included and credited to the process sector. However, the results of the first three actions are incorporated into the LC scenario of the energy sector.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Initiation of the catalytic N<sub>2</sub>O<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> destruction project in the nitric acid plant starting in 2022.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Launch of the HFC use reduction program, to comply with the objectives of the Kigali Amendment. Through this program, all stakeholders in the HFC sector will be mobilized for a coordinated intervention in several areas:</p>

          <p>Tunisia will also launch the PROMOFRIGO and PROMOCLIM projects, which will operate mainly on the "bank" of HFCs by removing from the current fleet via dedicated mechanisms old and therefore not very energy efficient appliances using HFCs with high GWP, by destroying and destroying and regenerating the HFCs that will be recovered from the appliances to be appliances to be scrapped every year.</p>
          <p>Including all of these mitigation measures, GHG emissions from the process sector would reach 7.2 MtCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030, a 13% decrease (1.1 MtCO<sub>2</sub>) compared to the same year in the BaU scenario.</p>
      <p>Over the period 2021-2030, the LC scenario would accumulate 8.4 MtCO<sub>2</sub> of avoided emissions; 55% of which would result from actions on HFCs, 31% from actions on N<sub>2</sub>O, and the remainder from efforts -mainly regulatory-based- made by the cement sector.</p>
      <p>Moreover, 43% of these results would be achieved on the basis of unconditional national efforts, and 57% through international support required for this purpose.</p>

</li>
</ul>
          <p>The LC scenario of the AFOLU sector now considers a classification according to integrated landscape approaches, combining agricultural, forest and rangeland landscapes, and focusing on:<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>
          <p>The rationalization of the use of cultivated land through the restoration of degraded agrosystems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sustainable management of forests and rangelands and restoration of degraded forest and pastoral landscapes.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
          <p>This integrated intervention approach will differentiate actions by land use type and by region.</p>
          <p>Through this integrated intervention approach, the LC scenario will induce the injection of greater resources in favour of the rural environment, to support the GHG mitigation policy in a fair and appropriate manner. These resources will ensure a better inclusion of all rural actors (women, youth, farmers’ organizations, etc.) and act as an engine of growth for the rural area, which will reintegrate the dynamics of growth and national development.</p>
          <p>From this perspective, the GHG impacts of the proposed AFOLU options would represent</p>
          <p>more of a co-benefit to the climate than the actual target of the proposed program.</p>
          <p>In addition to the integrated actions, the LC scenario for the agricultural sector considers a reinforcement of the actions already considered in the baseline (Incorporation of poultry droppings in composting processes, Organic Agriculture, Encouragement of legumes in field crops and Optimization of the use of synthetic mineral fertilizers), and the addition of five mitigation actions (feed additions supporting livestock productivity and inducing the decrease of enteric emissions, Conservation Agriculture, Energy valorisation of droppings, Energy valorisation of bovine manure, and Energy valorisation of margins).<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
          <p>Net emissions from the AFOLU sector are in the form of negative balances in both the BaU and LC scenarios, which means that removals are always greater than emissions over the entire trajectory, and therefore more than offset emissions.</p>
      <p>The Low Carbon (LC) scenario, however, presents a net balance 58% better than that of the BaU scenario. The net additional absorptions achieved thanks to the LC scenario compared to the BaU net absorption level, would be of the order of 2.5 MteCO<sub>2</sub> by the year 2030. In cumulative terms over the period 2021-2030, they would total 9 MteCO<sub>2</sub>, of which 35% would result from emission reduction measures, and 65% from carbon absorption measures. These results would be achieved in equal parts (50%-50%) based on unconditional national efforts and international support.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Waste :</p>
          <p>For solid waste, the IPCC 2006 emission calculation model for GHG inventory purposes was transformed into a forward-looking tool and used in the modelling of future emissions.</p>
          <p>The potential impacts of landfill energy projects are incorporated into the low-carbon scenario for the energy sector.</p>
          <p>The sanitation sector was treated using the same approach as the solid waste sector. The estimation of avoidable emissions was done on the basis of the IPCC 2006 guidelines</p>
          <p>The impacts of the sludge recovery and cogeneration project to be initiated by the sanitation sector refer only to the emission avoidances induced by the reduction of storage times and rates and the recovery of CH<sub>4</sub>, respectively. All other GHG impacts, including energy recovery projects, are accounted for in the energy sector.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Solid waste:</p>
          <p>The LC scenario for the solid waste sector considers eight main actions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
          <p>Reduction of the average daily amount of household waste produced by city (kg/ capita/day) in 2030 by 7% compared to 2020.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Increase the material recycling rate of household waste produced in urban areas by 13% in 2030 compared to 2020.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Increase the rate of organic (composting) and/or energy (RDF and electricity) in 2030 by 30% compared to 2020 reductions (i)from RDF use by the cement sector are credited to the energy sector).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reduction in the rate of controlled landfilling of final waste (including through RDF production, and MBT, and any other recovery technology), in 2030 by 54% compared to 2020.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Systematization of degassing at least until 2030 on controlled landfills already equipped with systems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Generalization of electricity production from landfill biogas (reduction of emissions credited to the energy sector)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Energy recovery from margins (reduction of emissions credited to the energy sector)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
          <p>Sanitation/Wastewater Treatment:</p>
          <p>The LC scenario for the sanitation sector considers six main actions already identified by the Sanitation NAMA developed in 2013, and obviously still on the agenda insofar as they are still included in NSO’s development priorities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
          <p>Improvement of the wastewater treatment rate (90% by 2030)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Improved management of WWTPs (urban and rural), including the rehabilitation of several of them,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Improvement of industrial connection and reduction of COD (aerobic treatment and management optimization)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Recovery of sludge (in the agricultural sector and possibly in cement plants)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Improvement of energy efficiency and development of cogeneration</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Installation of photovoltaic systems</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
          <p>Thus, in 2030, the emissions of the waste sector, according to the Low Carbon Scenarios (LC), would reach 4 MteCO<sub>2</sub>; that is to say 1.2 MteCO<sub>2</sub> (23%) below the emissions of the BaU scenario.</p>
          <p>In cumulative terms over the period 2021-2030, the waste sector LC would reduce emissions by 5.5 MtCO<sub>2</sub> compared to the BAU, 92% of which would come from actions targeting solid waste, with the remainder coming from the sanitation sector. These results would be achieved by 58% based on unconditional national efforts, and 42% through international support.</p>
          <p><strong>Local variations of GHG mitigation policies</strong></p>
          <p>Tunisian cities are growing at a rapid pace, and concentrate an increasing share of the national population, as well as the most of the economic activities, and therefore of the GDP. They therefore have a very important responsibility -direct and indirect- in the national emissions of GHG. In Tunisia, it's estimated that at least 50% of emissions occur within urban areas, through industrial activities and intercommunal transport. but also sources from the building sector (residential and the building sector (residential and tertiary).</p>
          <p>Tunisian cities should therefore be considered as essential pillars of national mitigation policies through relevant and efficient solutions and choices focused on the transition to new models of urban development and planning and lifestyles that are more climate- friendly but also resilient to climate impacts.</p>
          <p>Better local development planning should lead to the consideration of of climate issues, according to the specificities inherent to each Tunisian municipality, and by putting the access on the priorities of a better energy efficiency, the use of renewable energies, better urban mobility, including cleaner modes of transport, as well as transport, as well as a generalized improvement of health and living conditions through an integrated conditions through an integrated liquid and solid waste management policy.</p>

                <h3>1.6 National expected emissions</h3>
                <p>The following figure presents the respective GHG emission trajectories of the baseline, the unconditional national effort and the updated NDC low-carbon scenario (considering substantial international support).</p>
                <p>It is useful to recall that the net emissions -in absolute terms- of the updated NDC low- carbon scenario would be 33% below the net emissions of the first NDC low-carbon scenario by 2030. Even better, they would be well below the 2010 emission levels (-11%).</p>

          <h2>2. THE UPDATED TUNISIAN CONTRIBUTION TO ADAPTATION</h2>
          <p>The updated version of the adaptation component of Tunisia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is based on a precise review of the exposure of national and sectoral vulnerabilities. This review is based on finer climate projections allowing a more robust downscaling to the level of territories.</p>
          <p>In addition, the update of the NDC integrates three new cross-cutting dimensions (gender, land use planning and natural disaster risk reduction) axes and measures aimed at limiting the impacts of climate change by 2050.</p>

                <h3>2.1. Vulnerability to climate change</h3>
                    <p><strong>2.1.1. Water resources</strong></p>
                    <p>Climate projections<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> indicate that water resources will be particularly exposed to i) increased demand for water and conflicts of use; ii) overexploitation of groundwater; iii) declining water stocks, and iv) degradation of water quality including salinization of coastal aquifers. The total loss of water resources from these aquifers by 2050 has been estimated at about 220 million m3 per year, which represents about 75% of the total coastal<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> water resources. The capacity of the water sector to adapt to these impacts is considered moderate to low. The most vulnerable groups of people in rural areas are women farmers and children, as well as farmers with small areas<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. The most vulnerable groups in urban and peri-urban areas are the poor, the unemployed, and the elderly.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.1.2. Agricultural production</strong></p>
                    <p>Climate projections predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts. These will affect cereal production, which would fall by almost 40% by 2050 according to the RCP8.5<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> scenario. The drop in yields that will affect olive production could reach 32%. The share of agricultural production in the national GDP would decrease by 5% to 10% in 2030, depending on the scenarios of economic openness of the agricultural sector. The impacts will be reflected in a drop in yields and a reduction in the area of tree and cereal crops, a loss of soil fertility and the area of arable land. The highest level of vulnerability is observed in central and southern Tunisia, and the level of vulnerability is particularly critical in the south (east and west).</p>

                    <p><strong>2.1.3. Natural Ecosystems</strong></p>
                    <p>There are many challenges to the balance of natural ecosystems, their capacity to regenerate and the maintenance of the ecosystem goods and services they provide. On biodiversity itself, the threats are the result of an interaction of factors, notably anthropogenic, accentuated directly or indirectly by climate change, including the destruction, in particular by forest fires, and the fragmentation of habitats, especially in forest and steppe environments, air, soil and freshwater pollution at the level of coasts and agrosystems, the overexploitation of terrestrial and marine animal and plant resources and the intrusion of invasive alien species.</p>
      <p>Climate projections predict more hot days, greater water stress, and irregular precipitation. These impacts would result in fewer opportunities for biological recovery, multiplication of natural species, and renewal of seed stocks in rangeland, steppe, and forest soils. These impacts will affect the yields of wood and non-wood forest products and fodder in natural ecosystems. Heavy losses are to be expected in southern Tunisia where most of the available pastoral land is located. Thus, the areas favourable to pastoral plants are likely to decrease by an average of 19% and to move up towards the north of Tunisia.</p>

              <p><strong>2.1.4. Coastal zones</strong></p>
              <p>On the Tunisian coast, climate change will be accompanied by a rise in sea level (ENM) and an increase in temperature, salinity and acidity of water. These effects of climate change will lead to other impacts such as the loss of built-up areas, coastal and agricultural infrastructure, erosion of the coastline and the degradation of coastal ecosystems. Thus, in the coastal zone, more than 3100 hectares of urban areas are considered vulnerable and threatened by submersion. In addition, on the Tunisian eastern coastal area a large part of the water resource is provided by the coastal water tables that are highly vulnerable to the ENM consequences of salinization. Thus, 44% of the Tunisian coastline is classified as vulnerable to very highly vulnerable, while the coastline is moderately vulnerable to 24% and those weakly to very weakly vulnerable are around 32%.</p>

              <p><strong>2.1.5. Health</strong></p>
              <p>The main health impacts due to climate change concern the recrudescence and emergence of vector-borne diseases; the increase in the incidence of water-borne and food-borne diseases; the aggravation of diseases related to air pollution and the increase in the frequency and intensification of the health effects of floods. We could also fear the emergence of new diseases still absent from the territory such as the Chikungunya virus fever or the Zika virus fever, which are present on the African continent. In addition, there is the effect of floods with the risk of destruction of drinking water distribution and sanitation infrastructure and the contamination of surface and ground water. Finally, under the effect of pollution by fine particles and ozone coupled with that of pollen allergens, respiratory diseases could be exacerbated.</p>
              <p>The interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are presented in several reports as cumulative effects. In a scenario where both effects, pandemic and climate change, develop at the same time, human populations with limited resources and capacities would tend to be more vulnerable to exceptional crises. Consequently, this global health crisis would exacerbate already existing inequalities.</p>

              <p><strong>2.1.6. Tourism</strong></p>
              <p>The acceleration of sea level rise (ENM) is a major threat to tourism, which remains essentially seaside in Tunisia. The retreat of the coastline is done at rates often between 0.5 and 1.5 m / year, and nearly 440 km of coastline, or 26.6% of the Tunisian coastline, have been assessed as having a very high vulnerability to marine submersion and erosion. This particularly concerns the gulfs of Hammamet (40% of total beaches), Tunis (30% of total beaches) and to a lesser extent at the islands of Djerba and Kerkennah (respectively 24% and 14% of total beaches). Although the sector consumes less than 1% of the country’s water potential, the water stress that Tunisia is already experiencing will be reinforced, which will have repercussions on tourism facilities in terms of operating costs and health safety. The intensification of heat waves should also affect financially the sector in their management of energy, especially dedicated to the air conditioning of buildings. Finally, the fragility of jobs is a direct consequence of the disruption of tourism activity. The average loss of jobs due to the phenomenon of climate change by 2030 is estimated at 1000 jobs per year.</p>

              <p><strong>2.1.7. New cross-cutting areas</strong></p>
              <p>This update of the NDC is enriched by the inclusion of three areas that were not sufficiently taken into account in the first NDC, namely: gender, land use planning and climate change disaster risk reduction (DRR).</p>
                  <h4>2.1.7.1. Gender</h4>
                  <p>Despite economic conditions that have been severely degraded by the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has severely affected the country's economy and vulnerable groups particularly women, Tunisia shows its will to continue the legal and institutional progress for the institutional advances for the sustainable economic and social reinforcement, and thus maintains its status its status as a vanguard country in the Arab world in terms of women's rights and emancipation and its emancipation.</p>
                  <p>This status implies that women are entrusted with an important role in the fight against climate change.</p>

                  <h4>2.1.7.2. Land use and urban planning</h4>
                  <p>The dramatic consequences of past and recent floods caused by a land-use planning approach that approach to land use planning that does not sufficiently integrate the effects of climate change has the importance of taking into account the climate in land use planning in Tunisia.</p>
                  <p>The effects of climate change are more pronounced in cities where the urbanization movement is accelerated by the extension of urban extensions of urban perimeters. This urban extension is due to a marked peri-urbanization marked, in addition to the formal modes of land and real estate production, by the proliferation of non-regulatory neighborhoods and informal occupations on floodable land and on drainage lines. In addition to this, there is also the inadequacy of infrastructure.</p>
                  <p>The increase in intensity and frequency of extreme events under the effect of climate change climate change torrential rains in a limited time, extreme heat waves, marine heat waves, marine submersion, storms, etc.) have shown the limits of the traditional design of urban spaces in Tunisia. This leads to the necessary consideration of of the climate risk in the extensions of the current cities, the design of buildings or during the elaboration of urban development plans.</p>
                  <p>The Tunisian territories do not all have the same capacity to adapt to climate disruption. These territorial disparities are likely to be strongly accentuated by the climatic drift accentuated the next decades which calls for strong responses.</p>

                  <h4>2.1.7.3. Disaster Risk Management, including Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR-DRM) related to climate change</h4>
      <p>Vulnerability studies show without a doubt that the effects of climate change will significantly increase the country’s exposure to the risks of flooding, particularly in urban areas, rising sea levels and flooding along the coast, more frequent and severe droughts in the south, and the occurrence of forest fires, particularly in the north and centre-west of the country. In addition to endangering human lives that need to be protected, the impacts of these extreme events, which are thus amplified, create risks of social conflicts that threaten the political stability of the country.</p>
      <p>The impacts of these extreme events are already and will be increasingly heavy on the national budget due to the very high costs of response and rehabilitation/reconstruction measures.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Resilience Building Goals by 2030</h3>
                <p><strong>2.2.1 The Resilience Star</strong></p>
                <p>The general objective of the updated NDC to 2030 is to <i><strong>«promote a Tunisia resilient to climate change, having significantly reduced vulnerabilities and strengthened the adaptive capacities of its ecosystems, its population, its economy, its territories, and operated the necessary transformations, able to ensure a model of socio-economic development inclusive and sustainable and thereby contribute to a more resilient world»</strong></i>. This objective is fully in line with the resilience trajectory of the NSCRD, which is aimed at the 2050 horizon.</p>
                <p>Faced with more frequent and intense climate hazards, a resilient Tunisia must be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Ensure a renewed and shared economic growth can lead to progress, and create jobs for all.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Anticipate climate disturbances (sudden or slow).</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Reduce or absorb the effects.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>To recover and bounce back thanks to adaptation, solidarity and innovation.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>To evolve towards a new state of dynamic equilibrium and to transform itself while preserving the functionality and performance of its natural and human systems.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To be achieved, this objective must be based on a comprehensive and cross-cutting framework for adaptation that concerns all aspects of the nation and its development. The updated NDC therefore proposes a paradigm shift and the adoption of a systemic and cross-sectoral approach, making it possible to define resilience in its different dimensions: food; water; ecological; social; economic; territorial; health and to natural disasters related to climate change.</p>
                <p>This approach forms the «resilience star» (Figure 6) which is designed as a structuring framework to support Tunisian actors and their technical and financial partners in their efforts to strengthen adaptation, risk reduction and anticipation capacities. This star, like the explorers of the past, must serve as a course for the country in its quest for future resilience by 2050, with 2030 as the transformative deadline for putting Tunisia on this trajectory.</p>

                    <h4>2.2.1.1 Food Resilience</h4>
                    <p><strong>Food resilience links to sectors/areas</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>General objective of food resilience by 2030</p>
                        <p>To enable the agricultural, livestock and fisheries sector to ensure food security for the Tunisian population in a sustainable manner, in sufficient quantity and with the required quality. This objective will be achieved through the implementation of adequate and appropriate measures to improve the resilience of production systems, channels, markets ... etc., and producers and other actors. It is a question of modernizing the sector through its digitalization, creating, processing, and sharing information with the actors in order to improve the monitoring and the reaction to the effects of climate change. For the structuring measures of adaptation, they will concern the strategic productions (such as cereals, olives, meats, seafood ... etc.) and production factors (soil, seeds, ...) as well as markets and other channels.</p>

                    <p>To ensure the Tunisian population and the sectors using water resources a sufficient, continuous and quality water supply by 2030. This means mobilizing all the resources still possible in the country, improving the management of stocks, ensuring the balance between the sectors requesting water (including ecological water) and avoiding potential conflicts, improving the quality of purified water, and massively increasing the use of non- conventional water for the benefit of sectors not requiring green water. There is also a need to focus on transferring knowledge and skills to practitioners, introducing or reintroducing good water management practices, exploring nature-based solutions, and encouraging research and action.</p>

                    <h4>2.2.1.4 Territorial Resilience</h4>
                    <p>To respond globally to the challenges of equitable adaptation, social resilience must be reinforced by its transversal corollary, which is linked to the living environment of the populations, namely territorial resilience. To this end, it is imperative to integrate adaptation into decisions and planning instruments for development and territorial planning. This territorial dimension was not taken into account in the 1st NDC of Tunisia. It is now a matter of integrating land use planning measures considering the aspirations of communities’ needs and the territorial disparities that have increased in recent years due to a lack of means to cope with the effects of climate change in the most vulnerable regions. These choices have ended up obliterating the social aspects thus releasing the loss of control of space, the devaluation of traditional developments (micro-hydraulic, housing type Dar ...) where men and women master and appropriate the space and territoriality of their experience and collective memory.</p>

                    <p>Faced with climate change, the objective for Tunisia will be to mobilize the economic sectors to ensure that economic actors anticipate the risks identified and deploy the necessary means (financial, human, infrastructure, etc.) to reduce their economic vulnerability and the consequences on jobs. The objective aimed at 2030 is therefore to limit the impacts of climate change on economic sectors and support their gradual transformation to more resilient models to ensure sustainable growth and job creation. Tunisia is committed to supporting the various sectors in the development of resilient activities that respect the ecosystems on which they rely. The public authorities will support prospective work to raise awareness and mobilize economic actors for greater integration of climate risks in their development and investment strategy. The vulnerabilities and costs of inaction and adaptation for a certain number of priority sectors (tourism, wood, agri-food, industry, transport, buildings/construction, digital, banking and finance, etc.) will be assessed and support measures identified. Risk assessment tools and criteria and communication on good practices will be proposed to help economic actors consider climate change and its effects on project profitability and investment decisions. Given its weight in the national economy and the impacts of climate change (beach erosion, water stress threatening the supply of drinking water, discomfort due to heat waves, etc.), tourism is one of the main challenges and a pilot area for the adaptation of Tunisian economic sectors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Objectives of economic resilience by 2030</strong></p>
                    <p>Tunisia’s action will involve a shared assessment of the risks associated with climate change in the economic sectors, raising the awareness of the actors concerned, and then strengthening the technical capacity to adapt infrastructures and services. The objective will be to limit the impacts of climate change on the economic sectors and to support their gradual transformation towards more resilient models to ensure sustainable growth and job creation.</p>

                    <p>Tunisia has a new objective of ecological resilience which, in addition to the resilience of productive ecosystems, addresses together the challenges of combating climate change and the loss of biological diversity considering the interdependence between these topics (approach «nexus» climate biodiversity), to move towards an ecological and ecosystem resilience in Tunisia. This objective of resilience is based on the objectives, axes and national priorities of the Strategy and National Action Plan for Biodiversity (NBSAP) established by Tunisia by 2030 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the aim of having a biodiversity resilient to climate change by 2030, safe from threats, conserved and managed to contribute sustainably to the socio-economic development of the country. This goal responds to priority 2 of the NBSAP 2018 - 2030, which calls for the integration of biodiversity values into all national and societal policies. This objective must contribute to the reduction of the rate of depletion of the components of biodiversity with its three hierarchical levels (ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity) and the sustainable use of biological diversity by strengthening ecosystem services, reducing the pressures resulting from the negative impacts of climate change but also the risks of natural disasters that are exacerbated by these impacts.</p>

                <p><strong>2.2.2 Financing needs for adaptation measures</strong></p>
      <p>The assessment of the achievements of the 1st NDC reveals that the adaptation funding committed during the 2015-2019 period is insufficient compared to the needs. The needs of the revised NDC are estimated according to two methods: the bottom-up approach, which is based on the sum of the costs of priority adaptation measures estimated by the sectors, and the top-down approach, which estimates the adaptation needs at 1% of GDP.</p>
      <p><strong>Estimated needs by sectors</strong></p>
      <p>As a result of the sectoral consultations conducted during the first half of 2021 (bottom-up approach), the estimated financing needs for the period 2021-2030 amount to more than USD 2,852 million. On an annual basis, compared to the 1st NDC, the needs double (285 million/year versus 127 million). Although this increase in needs is significant, it is still largely underestimated because not all needs could be accounted for following the consultations (particularly sectoral needs related to social, health and economic resilience).</p>

      <p><strong>Estimated needs based on macro-economic indicators</strong></p>
      <p>Considering the global simulations of adaptation needs developed by UNEP (top-down approach from the Adaptation Gap Report), Tunisia’s financing needs to respond to the high level of expected climate risks could amount to more than USD 400 million as early as 2021 (i.e., nearly 2% of the national budget or 1% of the Gross Domestic Product) to reach the annual cost of USD 475 million by 2030. <strong>Based on these annual simulations, the financing needs for the period 2021-2030 could amount to more than US$4,361 million.</strong></p>

      <p>While it is still difficult to estimate the additional cost that any delay in funding would create- including the delay in implementing mitigation measures that will impact the magnitude of adaptation measures-it is unanimously recognized that the longer a country delays investing in its low-carbon and resilience pathway, the higher the costs of adapting to the effects of climate change for that country. In macro-economic terms, this could mean a doubling of Tunisia’s adaptation financing needs to 3-4% of the national budget by 2050, or more than USD 1 billion per year.</p>
      <p><strong>Priority international support required</strong></p>
      <p>Without neglecting the importance of national and private sources of financing, international financial contributions from TFPs will have to play a very significant role. Priority contributions (in the order of 60% of financing needs) should amount to more than US$240 million per year as of 2021, rising to more than US$285 million per year by 2030.</p>

      <h2>3. Cross-cutting issues of mitigation and adaptation</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Improving governance</h3>
            <p>Tunisia has taken many steps to strengthen the institutional framework and improve climate governance in order to implement the Paris Agreement. Notably, within the Ministry of Local Affairs and the Environment, where the national focal point for the Paris Agreement is designated, the National Coordination Unit on Climate Change (UGPO-CC) was established by Decree No. 2018-263 of March 12, 2018, whose mission of coordinating climate action by public and private actors and measures taken to implement the NDC was specified, as was its central role in promoting the integration of climate change into all public policies and building capacity at the national and local levels.</p>
            <p>In addition, two technical advisory committees, respectively in the areas of adaptation and mitigation, were established by Decree No. 2018-263 of March 12, 2018, and installed by a Decision No. 69-2020 of February 07, 2020.</p>
            <p>Chaired by the Ministry of Local Affairs and the Environment, these advisory committees will contribute to the identification of national priorities, the preparation of national reports and all documents that fit into the enhanced transparency framework of the Paris Agreement, including facilitating the collection of data related to progress in implementation, as well as coordination with international and regional organizations for better use of opportunities for support, cooperation and financing of national programs and projects in the field of greenhouse gas mitigation.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Improving the transparency framework</h3>
            <p>Tunisia has launched important work to have a comprehensive national transparency system in accordance with the Paris Agreement Rulebook. This national transparency system will be strengthened, with a national emissions inventory system (NEIS) and an organizational, institutionalized, and regulatory framework (OIR framework) for monitoring and evaluating mitigation actions and progress in the implementation of the NDC, as well as for monitoring the financial support needed and received.</p>
            <p>Specific work is being done in parallel to have an efficient RTI framework for reporting on climate change impacts and adaptation outcomes. This national transparency system will be operational during 2022, two years before the deadline prescribed by the Paris Agreement Rulebook.</p>

            <h3>3.3. Capacity building and technology transfer needs</h3>
            <p><strong>Climate Empowerment Action (CEA)</strong></p>
            <p>If countries are to meet their NDC targets and sustain climate action over the long term, six action will require the implementation of six accompanying measures referred to by the UNFCCC Secretariat and UNESCO as ACE. This term refers to the measures that to be taken under Article 6 of the UNFCCC and Article 12 of the Paris Agreement, and Agreement, and is closely linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (notably SDG targets 4.7 and 4.7 and 13.3).</p>
            <p>ACE specifically covers 6 core areas of intervention:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Education</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Training</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Public awareness</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Public access to climate information</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Public participation</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>International cooperation</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
                <p>Tunisia will accompany the implementation of its NDC by a concrete and structured program of measures of measures covering the six areas of the CEA19. This program will help to create a sustainable political will, strengthen societal ownership of the climate challenges, seriously mobilize youth, civil society, the private sector and all stakeholders, and finally to mainstream climate change and to include climate concerns and challenges in a sustainable development policy strongly supported by the Tunisian state.</p>
                <p><strong>Capacity building</strong></p>
                <p>Tunisia has made capacity building an important lever of the national policy to fight against climate change. In terms of mitigation, the capacity building measures required to facilitate the achievement of the objective of the updated NDC concern the training of actors, institutional strengthening, as well as technical assistance to sectoral mitigation programs (see details in section 1.3).</p>
                <p>In addition, a National Capacity Building Plan for Tunisian actors in the field of climate change had been established in 2017. In the field of adaptation, this plan includes 13 actions around the following themes: basic concepts, strengthening the strategic and legislative framework, institutional governance, integration of adaptation into decision-making processes, economic analysis of climate change and adaptation, financing modalities of, development of climate services and products, organization and support for research on adaptation, tools for observing and monitoring the effects of climate change and MRV, information and knowledge management, education and continuing education, tools and technologies for adaptation.</p>
                <p>The roadmap developed in 2019 for the implementation of the first NDC reconfirmed and completed the actions of the National Plan. This roadmap has provided for the strengthening of the following aspects in particular:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Monitoring and reporting,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Education, awareness of the effects of climate change, and good adaptation practices,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Integration of climate change into development planning,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Management of genetic resources (collection, conservation, valorisation...),</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Negotiations on climate change,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Drafting of climate financing requests,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Rehabilitation of local know-how and spin-offs,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Monitoring and sustainability of works,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Conflict management and mediation,</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Strengthening the human and material resources of the various key institutions.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
                <p><strong>Research and technology transfer</strong></p>
                <p>Research : National research priorities have clearly incorporated climate change adaptation and adaptation to climate change as well as the sectors considered as priorities at the level of the sustainable water resources management, biodiversity conservation and climate change, agriculture, coastal erosion and climate change, agriculture, coastal erosion and desertification, epidemics and diseases, development models and land use planning. It should be noted that note that the specific priorities for agricultural research (identified by IRESA) are in line with the in line with the priority actions in Annex 2. In addition to the national programs funded under the priorities, Tunisian research is very collaborative at the international level.</p>
                <p>Indeed, Tunisia is an associated partner in the EU research program (Horizon 2020) and has demonstrated the capacity and expertise of its research structures to mobilize to mobilize the necessary funding and participate in a framework of scientific excellence.</p>
                <p>The development of scientific research in the field of adaptation to climate change is a key pillar in the climate change is an essential pillar in the different stages of the adaptation process. It requires a holistic, multidisciplinary approach that considers the different nexuses and integrates global and local thematic models. All of this in a framework of RRI (responsible research and innovation) that involves several actors. In order to consolidate the national effort and consider the global nature of climate change, Tunisia will want to mobilize international cooperation to finance:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The co-construction of a multidisciplinary, impact-oriented (multi-profiles) national program that initiates a process of transformative and equitable adaptation in a sustainable manner equitable adaptation process;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The development of integrated models for the study of vulnerability with dynamic mapping and dynamic mapping and vulnerability trajectories well traced and applied to sectors, territories or production processes (integrated and adapted system of monitoring and monitoring and modeling system). The objective is to reduce the existing uncertainties in the analysis of the impact of climate change and to create tools for integrated quantitative assessment of risks and vulnerability. This will allow the design of adaptive management tools and to select appropriate measures, technologies and practices;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The development of digital innovation in the areas of adaptation;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The scaling up of innovative solutions through PPPs (Scale Up "ClimTECH")</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
                <p>In addition, the SNRCC (National Strategy for Resilience to Climate Change) of Tunisia (in progress) emphasizes the importance of developing and disseminating research and innovation in support of adaptation. In this framework, Tunisia commits to 2030 to accelerate the implementation of applied research programs, to support digital research and artificial intelligence for adaptation or to contribute to the establishment of a support and financing mechanism for ClimTech start-ups in order to meet the technological needs of the sectors.</p>
                <p>It is also important to emphasize that all of the measures in the priority actions for adaptation (Annex 2) will include an applied research/research-in-action component, technology research/research-in-action, technology transfer and/or capacity building as appropriate to ensure a scientific basis, transfer of research results and innovative / adapted technologies and/or knowledge transfer. This strengthen the intended impact of the planned action and its sustainability.</p>
                <p>Technology transfer programs will be necessary to allow Tunisia to access the main technological innovation niches related to the low-carbon transition, as well as the know-how and the appropriate industrial means to ensure the sustainability of its contribution. The Conference of the Parties of the Convention must mobilize the appropriate mechanisms to facilitate participation in international research and access to technological innovations (see details in section 1.3).</p>
                <p>In addition, the TNA (Technology Needs Assessment) project assessed the needs for three key sectors: agriculture, water resources and coastal and marine areas. As a result of this assessment, a TAP (Technology Action Plan) was developed. The priority technologies selected are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Conservation agriculture and payment for environmental services for the agricultural sector.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The implementation of a smart water system and an early warning system for the water sector.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The strengthening of the information and decision support system (SIAD) and coastal zone management for the coastal and marine sector.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.4 The gender issue in mitigation and adaptation policies</h3>
      <p>Strengthening the role of women in the low-carbon transition will undoubtedly accelerate the achievement of the objectives set, especially in the renewable energy and green economy sectors, but also and especially in the AFOLU sector. In the sectors concerned, many opportunities exist that require talents and varied skills and especially complementary to which Tunisian women can respond, while allowing a fair distribution of benefits.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of the gender dimension in the updated NDC reflects the commitment to use all available skills and human assets and validates Tunisia’s willingness to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, almost all of which include a gender dimension.</p>
      <p>To the efforts already initiated by the government in recent years on issues of gender equity and empowerment of women and youth, it will generalize and systematize the collection of quantitative and qualitative data disaggregated by sex, age and region for better analysis and more effective support for decision-making, to continue the promotion of gender equality and equity in the context of awareness programs and information aimed at policy makers and public officials but also the general public.</p>
      <p>In terms of training, the aim will be to adapt training and skills development programs in the technical and non-technical fields of mitigation and adaptation to the needs/constraints of women and to facilitate their access to them so that female entrepreneurship can develop.</p>
      <p>The government also intends to increase the participation of women and youth, with a view to achieving parity, in all consultation and governance bodies set up in relation to climate.</p>
      <p>In addition, more efforts will be made to network women and youth so that they can benefit from each other’s experiences and strengthen their negotiating and decision- making power, as well as their contribution to programs aimed at both low-carbon transition and adaptation.</p>
      <p>The adaptation component of the updated NDC identifies a set of gender-specific measures (see Annex 2) that measures (see Annex 2) that illustrate the importance of the issue for Tunisia and constitute an ambitious roadmap for 2030.</p>

              <p>The most recent comprehensive national GHG inventory in Tunisia covered the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. Very recently, the Tunisian energy sector has benefited from an updated inventory targeting all years from 2010 to 2020. To this end, recalculations have been made for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 for the energy sector. The other sectors have not yet been subject to an inventory operation for the years 2013 to 2020. This one should be launched very soon. At the same time, there may be recalculations for the process, AFOLU and waste sectors for the years 2010 to 2012, following possible methodological improvements or adjustments of data that may have become available. If this is the case, the values of the reference indicators could be updated.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the inventory operations in question were carried out by applying the IPCC guidelines of 2006.</p>
              <p>It is possible that Tunisia will opt in the future to use the 2019 IPCC guidelines. In this case, also, the values of the reference indicators could be updated.</p>

      <p>The updated NDC was prepared on the basis of broad consultations with the main stakeholders concerned by the issue of climate change in Tunisia, including public institutions, the private sector, civil society and experts operating in the various fields and sectors of GHG mitigation.</p>
      <p>These consultations took place under the aegis of the climate change focal point (MLAE), via the Management by Objectives Unit which is responsible for carrying out the monitoring and coordination program of activities relating to the implementation of the «Paris Agreement<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>». In the inter-stakeholder consultations, the CC focal point constantly relies on the sectoral focal points (established within the organizations concerned with GHG emissions and climate policies), but also on the two national committees in the respective fields of mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>The preparatory phases of the updated NDC started in October 2020, with the launch of consultations, in the form of meetings and workshops, involving the main stakeholders involved. The consultations continued throughout the first half of 2021, aiming at establishing the state of play of the achievements over the period 2015-2020, then the development of prospective work intended to update the trajectories 2021-2030, with a view to updating the objectives of the NDC of Tunisia. Each stage of consultations was the subject of national workshops to present the results, as well as workshops and sectoral meetings ad-hoc.</p>
      <p>The consultation process was intensified until the validation of the updated NDC.</p>
      <p>The elaboration of Tunisia’s contribution was also largely based on existing sectoral and horizontal strategies, such as the national strategy on climate change elaborated in 2012, the energy efficiency strategy, as well as the AFOLU and waste sectoral strategies, without forgetting the different sub-sectoral initiatives (e.g., cement, HFCs, nitric acid), and also the first NDC (2015), and the first and second biennial reports.</p>

            </td>
            <td>
              <b>Geographical position</b>
              <p>Tunisia is located in the north of Africa, on the southern shore of the Mediterranean and at the junction between the eastern and western Mediterranean basins. Tunisia is separated from Europe only by the Sicilian-Tunisian strait, 140 km wide. The total area of the country is 164 000 km2, of which about half is cultivable. Tunisia has 1,300 km of coastline, on both its eastern and northern sides.</p>
              <p>Tunisia is divided into two major geographical areas:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>a north-western zone with rugged terrain delimiting a series of high plains</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>a south-eastern zone with low and hilly terrain extending to the coast.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <b>Climate</b>
              <p>The relatively high latitude of Tunisia and its geographical stretching from north to south give it a succession of climatic zones ranging from subhumid in the extreme north, to semi-arid in the northwest and Cape Bon, to arid in central Tunisia to finally desert for the entire south.</p>
              <p>With a climate marked by aridity, Tunisia is considered among the Mediterranean countries most exposed to climate change, with the risk of a sharp increase in temperature. This increase would vary according to the regions, in the best case (RCP 4.5) between 1 ° C and 1.8 ° C by 2050 and between 2 ° C and 3 ° C at the end of the century. In the most pessimistic case (RCP 8.5), the increase could reach 4.1°C to 5.2°C at the end of the century. Projections also show a decrease in precipitation (-10% to 30% in 2050), a rise in sea level (30 cm to 50 cm in 2050) and an increase in extreme weather events (floods and droughts).</p>
              <p>These climate risks would have adverse social, economic, and ecological effects that would manifest themselves in the scarcity of water resources, the weakening of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, the decline of agricultural and tourism activities and the strengthening of the coastal economic activities.</p>
      <b>The national economy</b>
      <p>On January 14, 2011, the Tunisian people revolted against the oppression of freedoms and the difficult socio-economic situation marked by unemployment and regional imbalance. Since then, Tunisia has entered a phase of political transition in which democratization and equitable and sustainable socio-economic development are the main priorities.</p>
      <p>The Tunisian economy has been strongly affected by the political instability and social demands that have accompanied this democratization process. Indeed, the average economic growth did not exceed 1.8% over the period 2010-2019, whereas it was more than 4% before 2010. The health crisis has had a very negative impact on the Tunisian economy, which experienced a recession of -8.6% in 2020.</p>
      <p>This level of growth has not created enough jobs to lower the unemployment rate which stood at 17.4% at the end of 2020, or 725 thousand unemployed including about 45% of young graduates.</p>
      <p>Tunisia relies heavily on the green economy and particularly investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency as measures to exit the effects of the pandemic of COVID-19</p>
      <b>Sustainable development</b>
      <p>The new Constitution of Tunisia has considered sustainable development and the right of future generations among the fundamental rights of Tunisian citizens (Preamble and Art. 12). The joint responsibility of the state and society in preserving water resources, fighting climate change and the right to a healthy environment for all citizens has been included as a priority in Article 45 of the constitution. In addition, the constitution provides for the establishment of five independent
      constitutional bodies, including one for sustainable development and the rights of future generations.</p>
      <b>Fight against poverty</b>
      <p>The work of the latest national household survey in 2015 resulted in an estimated poverty rate of 15.2% in 2015 compared to 20.5% in 2010 and 23.1% in 2005. The extreme poverty rate was set at 2.9% in 2015 compared to 6% in 2010 and 7.4% in 2005.</p>
