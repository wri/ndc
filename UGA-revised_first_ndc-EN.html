  <h1>Uganda's NDC</h1>
  <h2>Ministry of Water and Environment</h2>
  <h1>Submission of Uganda’s Interim Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)</h1>
  <h1>12 October 2021</h1>
  <p>Uganda’s interim NDC submission is in response to paragraphs 24 and 25 of decision 1/CP.21 and in particular Uganda’s commitment to update its nationally determined contribution (NDC).</p>
  <p>In this submission is a table accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of our interim updated NDC in compliance with Decision 4/CMA.1.</p>
  <p>Uganda formally communicated its (I)NDC under the Paris Agreement on 14 October 2015 which became our NDC upon ratification of the Paris Agreement in November 2016.</p>
  <p>Since then, Uganda has undertaken steps to implement the NDC and increase its ambition. Most significantly is Uganda’s formulation of the National Climate Change Act 2021 to give the force of law to the Paris Agreement.</p>
  <p>Unlike Uganda’s initial NDC, the interim NDC aims to further strengthen mitigation actions on one part as well as adaptation actions. Adaptation remains the country’s priority response to climate change.</p>
  <p>Whereas our NDC submitted in 2016 projected 2030 emissions would be 77.3 MtCO2e, under this update they are projected to almost double.</p>
  <p>This interim NDC submission shows an improvement upon Uganda’s initial NDC which is presented as sector wide conditional reduction target as represented in the ICTU table below.</p>
  <p>To achieve this a multi stakeholder process, and internal approval process is still ongoing, once this is complete Uganda will formally communicate her updated NDC</p>
  <p>We believe that once the process is completed, the updated NDC shall show a marked improvement both in the process and format by which the 2030 sectoral target was determined and set to be implemented.</p>
  <p>Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of the updated NDC of Uganda for the period 2021 - 2030</p>

        <p>Uganda is a Least Developed Country highly vulnerable to climate impacts and characterized with very low emissions but undertaking climate actions with her domestic budget complemented by assistance from development partners.</p>
        <p>Despite the country’s low human development index of 0.477, the country has set an economy-wide emission reduction target expected to be greater than the target in the first NDC communicated in 2016.</p>
        <p>The new target includes takes into account specific sector emission targets for Energy, Transport, Waste and Industry. This is a significant development since the first NDC target focused on only on AFOLU sector.</p>
        <p>The country intends to feature both a conditional and unconditional component in the new economy-wide emission reduction target.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the first NDC sectors and sub-sectors of focus have increased from 9 to 14 in the updated NDC i.e.</p>
        <p>Agriculture; Energy; Health; Forestry; Fisheries; Water & Environment; Urban, Tourism; Transport; Built Environment; Disaster Risk Reduction; Manufacturing and Ecosystems including Biodiversity, Rangelands and Mountains</p>

        <p>Uganda intends to transition to low carbon and climate resilient economy in the near future and thus its updated NDC represents her contribution and the fair share of domestic effort to achieve the long-term temperature goal.</p>
