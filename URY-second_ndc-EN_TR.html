<h1>Uruguay's NDC</h1>
<h2>EASTERN REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY</h2>
  <h2>Second Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement</h2>
<p>December 2022</p>
<p>1. Guiding principles of climate action.</p>
<p>The National Climate Change Policy (PNCC), as the framework of the country's climate policy since 2017, has as its general objective "to contribute to sustainable development, with a global perspective, of intra and intergenerational equity and of human rights, seeking a more resilient, less vulnerable society, with a greater capacity to adapt to change and climate variability, and more aware and responsible in the face of this challenge, promoting an economy with low carbon emissions, based on sustainable production processes and services that are environmentally, socially and economically, that incorporate knowledge and innovation.”</p>
<p>The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), presented by Uruguay in compliance with the provisions of the Paris Agreement, are part of that general objective and approach of the PNCC and serve as an instrument for its implementation and the establishment of its goals every five years, considering as a reference the trajectories presented in the Long-Term Climate Strategy for Low Emissions and Climate Resilient Development (ECLP).</p>
<p>That is why the implementation of the PNCC and the Second Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN2), in particular, are governed by the respect and safeguarding of human rights and the preservation of ecosystems, with a perspective of inclusion, intra and intergenerational equity, and gender from an intersectional approach and that includes a just transition.</p>
<p>These guiding principles of climate action will guide the implementation of all actions and measures included in this document.</p>
<p>2. National circumstances and main actions.</p>
<p>Uruguay is a relatively small country in area compared to the countries of the region, located in South America, with a population that resides mostly in the coastal zone and an economy based on agro-industrial production and services, such as tourism , which makes it a country particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and therefore adaptation is a national priority. Early actions aimed at increasing the adaptive capacity and resilience of society, productive systems and ecosystems have been prioritized and this acquires even greater relevance in the face of adverse climatic events that will become more frequent and that bring significant losses and damages.</p>
<p>The phenomena with the greatest recurrence and impact are floods caused by the overflow of rivers and streams after persistent rainfall events (drainage floods) or by meteorological tides (southeast). Urban floods cause the evacuation of population groups, with the consequent impact on their health (physical and emotional), income and housing. Meteorological tides (southeast) affect the coastal ecosystem and cause material damage to infrastructures. Droughts, in turn, have a direct negative impact on agricultural activity, affecting agricultural yield, livestock production, calving and animal mortality rates, as well as hydroelectric generation and the provision of drinking water.</p>
<p>Uruguay has focused its national adaptation planning strategy on priority areas due to their climate vulnerability. In 2019, the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Variability and Change for the Agricultural Sector (PNA-Agro) was presented, which aims to contribute to improving the livelihoods of rural populations through production systems sustainable animal and plant life and less vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and variability, considering the gender perspective in a transversal way.</p>
<p>In 2021, the National Adaptation Plan for the Coastal Zone to Variability and Climate Change (PNA-Coasts) was presented, focused on strengthening capacities to identify the impacts and vulnerabilities of the coastal sector and define concrete actions to adaptation in the coastal zone, and the National Plan for Adaptation to Variability and Climate Change in Cities and Infrastructures (PNA-Cities) whose objective is to reduce vulnerability to the effects of climate change by creating adaptation and resilience capacities in cities, infrastructures and urban environments. Both national plans transversally integrate the perspective of gender and generations following the Gender and Climate Change Strategy of the National System for Response to Climate Change and Variability (SNRCC), as well as the ecosystem-based adaptation (AbE) approach.</p>
<p>In turn, the country is working on the formulation of the National Adaptation Plan for the Energy Sector (PNA-E) and the National Adaptation Plan for the Health Sector (PNA-Health).</p>
<p>Together with the implementation of these actions, and despite the country having only a 0.03% share<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In total global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, important mitigation measures have been developed in various sectors.</p>
<p>In this sense, the consolidation of the decarbonization of the electrical matrix, achieved through the incorporation of around a third of the total installed power in wind energy, stands out in the energy sector. Added to this source is the installed biomass and photovoltaic solar power, which together with historical hydraulic energy, reached 94% of electricity generation in 2020. Thus, at the same time that GHG emissions were reduced in the electricity generation sector, Uruguay adapted the sector, which is highly dependent on rainfall, to climate change, opting for non-traditional renewable sources in a remarkably beneficial synergy for the country and the environment. global. The primary energy matrix presented 58% of renewables in 2020. These actions together with those of energy efficiency contribute to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change of the energy sector, within the framework of the National Energy Policy, in force since 2008 and with horizon to 2030.</p>
<p>For its part, in the agricultural sector there have been relevant transformations that have increased the sector's productivity accompanied by best practices from the environmental point of view, reducing the intensity of GHG emissions per unit of product.</p>
<p>Since 2019, the project "Climate-smart livestock production and soil restoration in Uruguayan pastures" has been carried out with the aim of increasing the production of livestock systems on natural fields and, at the same time, reducing GHG emissions per kilogram of meat, promote carbon sequestration in grassland soils, and restore ecosystem services. On the other hand, the country has implemented actions in the forestry sector towards the maintenance of native forest surface, on the one hand, and the promotion of forest plantations on the other. In 2022, the project "Agroecological and Resilient Systems in Uruguay (SARU)" began to be implemented, with the aim of strengthening public agricultural systems and rural producers to increase mitigation and adaptation actions to climate change and promote agroecological production. It will implement actions in line with national climate action policies, including climate change adaptation priorities outlined in the PNA-Agro that contribute, at the same time, to property sustainability processes through the promotion of biodiversity in the property system, maintenance or restoration of natural areas and the protection and efficient use of natural resources, conserving or increasing ecosystem services. It is expected to enhance synergies with the reduction of GHG emissions and/or improve carbon balances, tending towards neutral balances or that capture carbon.</p>
<p>Regarding the waste sector, strategies are being developed for better management and recovery. In 2019, the Comprehensive Waste Management Law was approved, a regulatory instrument that frames and regulates waste management at the national and departmental level with a focus on environmental, economic and social sustainability, promoting the circular economy. In accordance with the provisions of article 14 of said law, in 2021 the National Waste Management Plan (PNGR) was prepared, a strategic planning instrument at the national level for the implementation and development of the national waste management policy. </p>
<p>Considering the latest National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI) available and analyzing by gas, it can be seen that in 2019 4,850 Gg of carbon dioxide (CO2) were captured net. The emissions of this gas come mainly from the activities of the Energy sector from the burning of fossil fuels, particularly in transportation. In 2019 this sector contributed 6,170 Gg, 60% coming from Category "1.A.3 Transport". For its part, the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector contributed 445 Gg, while the Waste sector generated 1.2 Gg CO2 emissions. In contrast, the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector captured 11,466 Gg of CO2 net (29,581 Gg of gross emissions and 41,047 Gg of gross CO2 removals).</p>
<p>In turn, methane (CH4) emissions totaled 760 Gg in 2019 and were generated mainly in the AFOLU sector, a sector that represented 92% of the total, followed by the Waste sector, which contributed 7% and Finally, the Energy sector with only 1% of total CH4 emissions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 26 Gg. 96% came from the AFOLU sector, 3% from the Energy sector, 1% from the Waste sector and less than 1% from the IPPU sector.</p>
<p>Regarding the consumption of halocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), it is worth mentioning that in Uruguay there is no production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) or perfluorocarbons (PFCs), so demand has only been met through their import. The emissions of these gases were produced by their use in refrigeration, air conditioning, fire extinguishers, insulation foams and electrical transformation, among others. It was estimated that in 2019 254 and 1 Gg CO2-eq (GWP100 AR2) of HFCs and SF6 were emitted, respectively.</p>
<p>Considering the relative contribution to global warming of these gases, it is observed that the net emissions for 2019 were 19,463 Gg CO2-eq (GWP100 AR2) and if the contribution of the category "3.B Land" is not considered, the emissions they were 31,020 Gg CO2-eq (GWP100 AR2). When analyzing by gas, it is observed that CH4 emissions represent 51% of total national emissions and N2O emissions correspond to 26%, coming largely from food production. CO2 emissions accounted for 22% and those of HFCs and SF6, despite their great global warming potential, represent 1% of total national emissions.</p>
<p>Uruguay implements a comprehensive and coherent strategy to respond to the problem of climate change, focusing on the development of adaptation and mitigation actions but also involving the cross-cutting dimensions of the issue, such as governance and capacity building . In this sense, the creation of the SNRCC in 2009 stands out as the sphere of coordination of climate change policies and actions in the country. In 2016 the elaboration of the PNCC takes place in a participatory and multisectoral way. During 2017, as an instrument for the implementation of said Policy, the CDN1 was prepared and presented to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p>In the path of institutional strengthening and prioritization of the matter, the creation in 2020 of the Ministry of Environment (MA) and the National Directorate of Climate Change (DINACC) also stands out.</p>
<p>During 2021, the ECLP<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> for Low Emissions and Resilient Development was prepared to Climate with the objective of agreeing on and specifying a country vision regarding GHG emissions and removals and adaptation, resilience and risk reduction by 2050.</p>
<p>In the same year, the National Gender and Climate Change Plan was approved within the framework of the SNRCC with a horizon of 2024, in a manner consistent with the principle of social equity integrated into the PNCC. This Plan was preceded by the National Gender and Climate Change Strategy prepared in 2019, which defines the way to integrate this perspective into the PNCC and CDN based on categorization, generation of recommendations and commitments for gender equality in the measures included in the CDN.</p>
<p>In addition, during 2021 the process of elaboration of the National Action Strategy for Climate Empowerment (ENACE Uruguay) was developed, in line with the PNCC, the CDN1, the ECLP and the provisions of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement </p>
<p>As happened in most countries, Uruguay was strongly affected by the health crisis caused by the spread of COVID-19 during 2020 and 2021. As a consequence of the health crisis, economic activity in Uruguay contracted 6.1 % in 2020 compared to the previous year, after 17 consecutive years of economic growth. In 2021, signs of recovery were observed, with economic growth of 4.4%.</p>
<p>The significant drop in the product in 2020 resulted in an increase in poverty in the country. Inequality also increased, although the Gini index (0.387)<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> continues to show Uruguay as the most equitable country in Latin America. In this context, economic measures were carried out that sought to mitigate the effect of the crisis, particularly towards the most disadvantaged socioeconomic sectors.</p>
<p>Between 1990 and 2019, net GHG emissions increased by 8.6% (expressed in CO2-eq using the GWP100 AR2 metric), while the size of the economy more than doubled in the same period . This implies that Uruguay managed to halve its level of emissions per unit of GDP, thus advancing in the decarbonization strategy of its economy without affecting food production.</p>
<p>3. Process of preparation of the Second Nationally Determined Contribution</p>
<p>As in the case of CDN1 and ECLP, Uruguay's CDN2 was developed within the framework of the SNRCC. In particular, to address the development of this new contribution, during 2022 actions were carried out simultaneously in various working groups. Among them, one focused on adaptation aspects (in which the Second Adaptation Communication was developed) and another on the definition and analysis of mitigation measures and the corresponding objectives.</p>
<p>These working groups maintained permanent articulation among themselves and with other groups such as Gender, Education, Communication and Awareness, programming, Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (pMRV) and INGEI, in order to reach an integrated final document. </p>
<p>Technical work</p>
<p>In the framework of the working groups, the technical processes necessary for the formulation of the different components of the CDN2 were developed.</p>
<p>To define the mitigation measures and objectives, firstly, the most up-to-date information available on emissions and removals related to the different sectors and categories of the INGEI was analyzed. Likewise, the trajectories of GHG emissions and removals projected within the framework of the ECLP prepared during the year 2021 were reviewed and adjusted in the medium term. This information, together with the analysis of the objectives and measures of the CDN1 and its degree of progress , formed the basis of the work forward.</p>
<p>In each sector of the INGEI, work was done to define the measures that will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CDN2 which, in accordance with the rules of the Paris Agreement, must be progressively ambitious in successive CDNs. Based on these measures planned for the period 2025-2030, new projections of the expected development of the different sectors were made to estimate the impact on GHG mitigation and the setting of the corresponding objectives.</p>
<p>Regarding the adaptation component of the CDN2, the Second Communication on Adaptation (ComAd2), the analysis of the progress regarding the First Communication on Adaptation of Uruguay, included in the CDN1, which included various measures and actions that the country proposed and is carrying out to move towards the objectives of increasing resilience and improving adaptive capacity in a broad set of areas. In addition, work was done on the country's contribution to the Global Goal for Adaptation (GGA).</p>
<p>As part of the process of defining the measures included in the CRC2, workshops were held with the participation of relevant stakeholders related to the different areas and sectors. There, inputs were obtained that contributed to the technical analysis and evaluation of possible measures to be included in the CDN2.</p>
<p>Other central elements of the CDN2 in which we worked in an articulated manner are the cross-cutting aspects; The incorporation of the social and economic dimensions, and within these in particular the aspects of gender, generations, capacity building, private sector involvement, investment and financing needs, among others, are essential to consider when making the decisions viable. actions that will be implemented to achieve the objectives of the new CRC.</p>
<p>Regarding the private sector, lines of work were strengthened so that the various actors, both business and financial, incorporate the dimension of climate change into their lines of business and promote the mobilization of private financing for climate action. </p>
<p>Likewise, the gender perspective continued to be explored from an intersectional approach, analyzing the potential impact to respond to inequalities in each of the mitigation and/or adaptation measures that the country undertakes.</p>
<p>Among the aspects of capacity building and knowledge generation, the strategic guidelines and actions proposed in the ENACE, prepared in 2021, were considered. Therefore, it is expected that this CDN promotes the implementation of this Strategy and, in turn, that it guide future country contributions to climate empowerment action.</p>
<p>A macroeconomic evaluation of the mitigation measures proposed for CDN2 was carried out using a dynamic general equilibrium macroeconomic model that provided information on the impact of such measures on key macroeconomic variables. In addition to contributing to the integration of the economic and environmental dimensions, this tool allows the evaluation of alternative mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>The incorporation of these transversal dimensions sought to strengthen CDN2 and facilitate its implementation, reflecting an increase in ambition in relation to CDN1.</p>
<p>Participatory processes</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the process, an open digital participation platform was created<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to the public in which the population had a tool to express their points of view, contributions, suggestions and comments on actions that they are carrying out or are aware of regarding climate action. Through this space, it was also sought to expand knowledge about initiatives underway, concerns of the population regarding the problem of climate change, different adaptation and mitigation actions that take place at different scales. This is part of the country's work with the International Open Government Alliance and in particular with the objective of designing and implementing a participatory process to contribute to the development of the CRC2.</p>
<p>In this space, the schedule of the elaboration process and different milestones in the development of the CDN2 were also presented, so that the population had access to the most relevant information. In this sense, it was communicated about the instances of consultations that were carried out to gather inputs that were of interest for the definition of measures and objectives at the sectorial level and by areas, as well as the public consultation stage of the document was announced and implemented in draft state. The inputs received were analyzed when preparing the final document, which was again published on the platform for knowledge and dissemination to the public.</p>
<p>In addition, a capacity building and feedback process was developed with a group of 40 young people between the ages of 14 and 22 from different parts of the country and different contexts. The objective of the process was for young people to know and learn about the various aspects of climate change, causes, impacts, actions that can be carried out individually to fight against this phenomenon, policies and actions that are being carried out at the national level, context and international commitments among other issues, to then present their vision and contributions related to the process of elaboration of the CRC2 of Uruguay. A series of workshops were held where the various topics mentioned were addressed and the group of young people was trained, who at the end of the process presented a series of measures and lines of work that in their vision should be implemented and/or deepened to strengthen the climate action in the country. On the other hand, they also presented actions and measures to which they want to commit to contribute to the better and more efficient implementation of local and global initiatives.</p>

<p>The following are the objectives of Uruguay to mitigate climate change by 2030. These objectives are understood to be fair and ambitious considering that Uruguay is a developing country, whose participation in world emissions in 2019 was 0 03%, in which its GHG emissions come mainly from food production and which has implemented a series of measures early that allowed 58% of the global primary energy matrix and 94% of electricity generation to be based on renewable sources in the year 2020.</p>
<p>The mitigation objectives are established assuming that there will be no structural changes in the productive matrix of the country.</p>

<p>5.2. On mitigation targets and progressive ambition</p>
<p>Regarding its contribution in terms of GHG emissions, as in the CDN1 Uruguay presents global objectives to mitigate climate change by 2030 for the three gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O and adds an objective for hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs) that had not been considered in the CND1 objectives. As in CDN1, specific objectives are also presented in relation to beef production, in terms of emission intensity per unit of product (Gg of beef in live weight). These mitigation objectives represent an advance in the ambition with respect to the CDN1, since they show the country's effort towards the stability of emissions and sustainable development. The country continues to develop, reducing the intensity of emissions. On the other hand, this CDN shows a greater scope in terms of the GHGs considered. A relevant factor is that the global objectives in this CDN2 were defined in absolute terms, in line with what was proposed in the ECLP scenarios of Uruguay, unlike CDN1, which presented objectives in terms relative to GDP. The objective set for CO2 implies a considerable slowdown in the growth of emissions of said gas. Since 1990 and until the beginning of the implementation of the first energy transformation that occurred between 2010 and 2014, CO2 emissions grew at an average annual rate of 2.9% while the goal set for 2030 reduces said rate to 1.3% annual. Regarding CH4 and N2O, gases that come mainly from food production, the goal set for 2030 confirms the trajectory towards stable emissions that Uruguay presented in its ECLP, both with annual growth rates between 1990 and 2030 below 1%.</p>
<p>Regarding the contribution in terms of GHG removals, Uruguay presents specific objectives for the year 2030 of conservation and increase of carbon stocks for the different reservoirs and categories of land use, representing, as a whole, a progression in the ambition in relation to CDN1, as detailed below.</p>
<p>The mitigation objectives in terms of emissions cover 99.2% of the GHG emissions of the INGEI 2019 (without considering removals) according to the GWP100 AR5 metric, the latest INGEI available and submitted to the Convention. They cover all the INGEI issuing sectors: Energy, including Transportation; IPPU; AFOLU; and Waste, and include CO2, CH4, N2O and HFC emissions. SF6 emissions and N2O emissions from subcategory 3.C.4 Source FSOM are excluded.</p>
<p>In relation to the global objectives, it is important to highlight that Uruguay has implemented a very ambitious set of early measures, especially in some key sectors such as Energy. Within the framework of the Energy Policy (2008-2030), significant efforts have been made to achieve a clean energy matrix, making 58% of global energy supply renewable by 2020, and reaching 94% for electricity generation. . In parallel, a strategy to promote energy efficiency was developed that made it possible to reduce energy intensity at the national level.</p>
<p>The intensity of emissions from the primary matrix (CO2 emissions over energy supplied in Gg/ktoe) shows the significant decoupling of emissions with energy sources: from 1.7 (2007-2011) to 1.4 (2012 -2016) and 1.2 (2017-2021).</p>
<p>Early measures to decarbonise the electricity generation matrix have allowed Uruguay to reach the share of renewable energies that studies by the International Energy Agency</p>
<p>(IEA)7 recently projected for 2050 in its roadmap on the path to zero net emissions globally in that year (almost 90%). The high renewability of the electrical matrix raises the opportunity for the electrification of different uses, such as in the transport sector, to be a clear decarbonization option, unlike what happens in less renewable electrical systems. However, this situation also implies that the efforts that remain to be made in the decarbonization of the economy associated with energy emissions are increasingly challenging in technical, technological and cost terms and often with a marginal impact on the reduction of emissions. of GHG.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the last 30 years Uruguay's CH4 and N2O emissions, mainly associated with food production and, in particular, beef production, have remained relatively stable and increases in production have been significant. This is mainly explained by the increase in productivity and efficiency of the systems, stimulated by factors of the national and international context and by public policies that promote the adoption of technologies by the private sector, which has allowed the country to reduce significantly the intensity of emissions in agricultural production, particularly in the production of beef.</p>
<p>The emissions of the IPPU sector are directly linked to the level of activity of the industry and, therefore, the variations in GHG emissions are entirely explained by the variations in the sector. Although the IPPU sector represented only 2.1% of the country's total GHG emissions in 2019, throughout the time series cement production represented 70% of the sector's CO2 emissions, therefore there are the main decarbonization opportunities.</p>
<p>It is also important to highlight the commitments assumed by the country within the framework of the Montreal Protocol and those linked to the Kigali Amendment -ratified by Uruguay on July 27, 2018 through Law 19,644-, due to its relationship with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The objective of the Amendment is to gradually reduce the production and consumption of HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons), which are powerful GHGs with significant global warming potential. Since the entry into force of the Kigali Amendment, on January 1, 2019, Uruguay is complying with the commitments assumed that imply, on the one hand, the implementation of a "License System" for the control of consumption (import/export and transit) of HFCs and, on the other hand, the presentation of annual reports on the consumption of these substances to the different bodies of the Montreal Protocol.</p>
<p>Regarding the Waste sector, Uruguay approved in 2019 the Comprehensive Waste Management Law, which strongly promotes the reduction of waste generation and positions it as resources, betting on the development of national capacities so that the final disposal of waste does not be the basis of management. In 2021, the PNGR was prepared and approved, as a strategic planning tool that includes objectives, goals and lines of action, many of which constitute the main opportunities for climate change mitigation in this sector.</p>
<p>In this national context, this CDN Uruguay proposes for the energy sector to continue deepening demand-oriented actions such as energy efficiency measures that are already being implemented in the different consumption sectors and to continue incorporating electric vehicles in the bus sectors , taxis and remises, cargo and individuals, within the general framework of sustainable mobility. For this, the necessary charger infrastructure will also be deepened, which already has relatively wide coverage throughout the national territory, and which requires speeding up the incorporation of fast and ultra-fast chargers. Process improvement actions will also be implemented at the country's refinery, with the aim of increasing efficiency and reducing emissions per unit of product. In the cement industry, energy consumption per ton produced will be reduced from the use of filler in all the cement produced by the two cement plants of the National Administration of Fuels, Alcohol and Portland (ANCAP), a state company. This same action will reduce emissions from cement production and therefore from the IPPU Sector, since the filler will replace part of the clinker, whose production emits CO2 through chemical processes.</p>
<p>In addition to these actions, the country is working on various enabling frameworks and policies that will leverage mitigation actions. Among them, the approval and implementation of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Policy that includes mobility planning in the territory, modal change, emission reduction, accessibility and affordability of public transport, among others. Said Policy provides for a space for institutional coordination of all relevant national and subnational actors through the Inter-Institutional Commission for Sustainable Mobility that will be created for such purposes for its implementation. This policy will be supported in its implementation on some guides already prepared (Guide for the Planning of Sustainable Urban Mobility, Guide on Electric Urban Mobility) and pilots developed and in progress. Likewise, the approval and implementation of the National Circular Economy Strategy will provide the enabling framework and will generate new opportunities for climate change mitigation in the future.</p>
<p>For the agricultural sector, the incorporation of good management practices of the natural range and the breeding herd in livestock production establishments will continue to be deepened, which will contribute to continue increasing the productivity and efficiency of livestock systems and reduce the intensity of GHG emissions per unit of product, as well as preventing the loss and enhancing the sequestration of organic carbon from the soil. The use of technologies and infrastructure for the management of effluents and manure generated by the national dairy herd will continue to be promoted with the aim of achieving a circular economy and minimizing CH4 emissions and the implementation of technologies that improve efficiency in use. of nitrogenous fertilizers and reduce nitrogen losses by volatilization. On the other hand, some lines of work that are being developed at the national research level with objectives of reducing CH4 emissions for cattle and sheep and co-benefits with adaptation to climate change will be deepened, highlighting the development of a genetic improvement platform. that strengthens the incorporation of genomics in current programs and includes the estimation of the potential impacts of genetic improvement in the mitigation of GHG emissions. In addition, progress will be made in the generation of national information that allows quantifying the mitigation potential of other alternatives identified for the country's livestock systems. These lines of work will generate new opportunities for climate change mitigation.</p>
<p>Given the relevance of the emissions of the AFOLU sector in the country, 75.2% of the gross emissions according to the INGEI 2019 and the GWP100 AR5 metric, as in the CDN1, specific objectives are included to reduce the intensity of emissions per unit of product (measured in Gg of bovine meat by live weight), more ambitious than those included in the CDN1.</p>
<p>Regarding HFCs, within the framework of the commitments assumed under the Montreal Protocol and those linked to the Kigali Amendment, the unconditional global objective of reducing HFC consumption by 10% by 2030 is included in in relation to a baseline that the country must establish prior to the year 2024 based on the average consumption of HFCs from the years 2020 to 2022. This implies a greater scope in the gases included in the mitigation objectives proposed in this CDN and, therefore, Therefore, a progression in ambition in relation to CDN1.</p>
<p>For the Waste sector, within the framework of the PNGR, the country will continue deepening measures that enable a greater proportion of household solid waste disposed of in final disposal sites to be reached by projects that have capture and burning of CH4, promoting selective collection systems and strategies for the recovery of organic waste. The implementation of a National Strategy for the Prevention and Reduction of Food Losses and Waste and an Action Plan in prioritized sectors is also foreseen, which will provide the enabling framework and generate new opportunities for climate change mitigation in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the contribution in terms of GHG removals, Uruguay includes a series of objectives related to land use and forestry (corresponding to category 3.B. Lands of the AFOLU Sector of the INGEI). It is important to note that Uruguay presented net removals for category 3.B. Lands in the INGEI 1990-2019, for which the country has proposed to conserve and/or increase the carbon stocks associated with different reservoirs and the main categories of land use in the country (Forest Lands, Pastures, Peatlands and Lands of crop).</p>
<p>Regarding the Forest Lands category, native forests in Uruguay cover 4.8% of the national territory and their felling is prohibited by the Forestry Law (with some exceptions specified therein) [2] . This, added to the provision of incentives in the form of tax waivers for native forest areas registered with the MGAP General Directorate of Forestry, has made it possible to maintain the surface area of this ecosystem and its carbon stocks. On the other hand, the area of forest plantations increased significantly in Uruguay as a result of the approval and implementation of the Forestry Law, which has directly influenced the INGEI 1990-2019 with a significant contribution to CO2 removals from the AFOLU sector. Forest plantations for shelter and shade are of great relevance for the country's livestock production, since they provide welfare conditions for the animals, so maintaining their surface area is strategic for the country. Recognizing the key role of forests from the point of view of climate action, for this category Uruguay proposes to maintain the area of native forest in order to conserve the carbon stock of its living biomass, biodiversity and ecosystem services, as raised in CRC1. Regarding forest plantations, it is proposed to maintain an effective area under management that is greater than the area included as an objective in CDN1, in which there will be GHG emissions/removals associated with the forest production cycle itself. Regarding forest plantations for shade and shelter, including silvopastoral systems, it is proposed to maintain a larger area than the one included as a target in the CDN1 in which the carbon stocks of living biomass are conserved and conditions are generated to reduce the impacts of climate change on livestock production.</p>
<p>Regarding the Pastures category, the country has been promoting a paradigm shift in the management of natural fields that consists of adjusting the forage supply, regenerative management, and management of nitrogen inputs and outputs. This change will continue to deepen in the coming years through the incorporation of good natural field management practices in livestock production establishments, which will help prevent the loss and enhance the sequestration of organic carbon from the soil. Therefore, for this category, the country intends to increase the area of natural grasslands in which good natural field management practices are incorporated in relation to that included as an objective in the CDN1, in order to conserve and/or increase the soil organic carbon on that surface.</p>
<p>In the case of Peat Bogs, Uruguay intends to keep the area surveyed for the year 2020, greater than the area included as a target in the CDN1, in order to maintain the organic carbon contained in the peat. These peatlands are found mainly within the Eastern Humedales Ramsar site and their conservation is considered relevant within the framework of the implementation of the Ramsar Convention.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to the Cropland category, it is proposed to maintain soil organic carbon (SOC) in the crop area that is under Soil Use and Management Plans (PUMS) in the year 2030 and that have more than 30% of the length of the rotation with pastures and increase the COS in the surface of crops under PUMS in the year 2030 that have more than 60% of the length of the rotation with pastures. This objective is relevant for Uruguay considering that practically the entire agricultural area of the country is under PUMS, mandatory by law since 2013, which require crop rotation to avoid the degradation of agriculturally suitable soils, prevent erosion and promote agricultural systems. based on crop rotations and/or crop-pastures that manage to maintain higher levels of organic matter in the soil compared to the traditional monoculture practice, improve productivity and water storage capacity, and reduce the risk of erosion in the event of events precipitation extremes.</p>
<p>Uruguay's mitigation objectives should be analyzed considering that it is a developing country and particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which must continue advancing on the path of sustainable development, generate greater opportunities for its inhabitants, combat poverty and homelessness, achieve a greater level of equity in their society and sustainably produce food for a growing world population, with the least possible impact on the climate system.</p>
<p>These mitigation objectives account, as a whole, of a greater ambition in Uruguay's contribution to the ultimate objective of the Convention and the object of the Paris Agreement, based on equity and the principle of common responsibilities but differentiated and the respective capacities, and reflect the country's effort to increase its ambition in relation to the previous CRC.</p>
<p>Mitigation objectives are differentiated between unconditional and conditional on specific additional means of implementation. The latter refer both to financing and to development and transfer of technology and generation of capacities. A series of conditional measures have been identified which, in the event that the country receives specific additional means of implementation, can be implemented to achieve the conditional objectives included in item 5.1.2. of this CDN.</p>

<p>7.1.2. Process for the preparation of the Second Adaptation Communication.</p>
<p>Figure 1 outlines the process followed in the formulation of ComAd2 in Uruguay. The scheme shows the different stages from the beginning of the first activities carried out by the climate change adaptation working group (GdT.ACC) within the framework of the SNRCC in March 2022, until the presentation of ComAd2 to the UNFCCC in December 2022. The different phases or stages of the process included the application of some methodological guidelines in accordance with the stages and their objectives, promoting interdisciplinary participation, the transversality of the adaptation processes and the transparency that the technical approach allows, based on a schedule with specific milestones.</p>
<p><img width="1004" height="475" alt="Time scale Description automatically generated" src="img/URY-NDC2-1.png"></p>
<p>Figure 1: ComAd.2 Preparation Process</p>
<p>7.1.3. Main activities carried out</p>
<p>The preparatory phase was key to making decisions about the structure and components to be included in ComAd2, counting on the precedent of the first adaptation communication (ComAd1) that the first CDN (CDN1) used as a vehicle to present itself to the UNFCCC and adding the guidelines of Decision 9/CMA.1 and Section IV of Decision 18/CMA.1. This background made it possible to define the sections of this communication and plan the formulation, composition and format of the new generation of climate change adaptation measures, in addition to reiterating Uruguay's decision to use the second CRC as a vehicle to present ComAd2.</p>
<p>The <strong>Retrospective</strong> review of the linked adaptation processes, initially focused on the CRC1 and the National Adaptation Plans, allowed for a critical evaluation of achievements, barriers, challenges, good practices and lessons learned in the processes, experience that, added to other tools that make and contribute to the adaptation, allowed the form and substance behind the objectives of the adaptation to mature, and therefore the design and programming of the respective measures.</p>
<p>The <strong>Priorities</strong> arise as part of the methodological process implemented to define the measures, analyzing the advances, challenges and previous experiences. Those gaps that needed to be resolved were identified; the related needs to advance in the approach of complex processes; continuity, improvement and scaling of program lines started, as well as new lines derived from processes previously started and/or developed.</p>
<p>The incorporation of <strong>Transversal Approaches</strong> has been key in the entire process of preparing the ComAds of Uruguay. The participatory process for ComAd2 began with the joint and representative participation of the SNRCC institutions, giving way to instances by thematic areas without failing to consider the interrelationship between areas, once again taking up joint instances to share each of the advances. The mainstreaming in this ComAd2 integrates the gender perspective from an intersectional approach, as well as other fundamental aspects that make adaptation, such as risk reduction, co-benefits with mitigation, EbA and loss and damage reduction. Transversality occurs, both due to the participatory construction carried out by the responsible institutions within the framework of the SNRCC, as well as by other actors with additional experiences and views that provide complementary elements that sometimes escape due to institutional bias.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> has been fundamental throughout the process, from the socialization of the schedule and work scheme, as well as virtual and face-to-face, general and specific meetings. More than 15 virtual meetings were held with the entire GoT.ACC; more than 30 meetings with institutional and technical representatives of adaptation areas, including transversal subgroups; and two face-to-face workshops for the exchange. These are some of the elements that ensured <strong>consultation</strong> and constant technical participation throughout the process.</p>
<p>7.2. Context of Adaptation in Uruguay</p>
<p>Uruguay views adaptation to climate change as a national priority. The efforts made in recent decades to strengthen public policies, programs and specific measures in the area of adaptation are confirmed by the most recent actions carried out with a planning and implementing vision, promoted by the CDN1, the national adaptation plans and the ECLP. The latter being the instrument that synthesizes the main reasons for prioritizing adaptation [5]:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is essential to increase capacities for adaptation and resilience, in order to reduce risks and moderate the impacts derived and enhanced from climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is essential to dimension and specify the adaptation efforts made and project the necessary actions, according to national possibilities, to strengthen climate action in terms of adaptation and risk reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is desirable to contribute to the strengthening of a global governance that registers a political parity and the mobilization of financial resources between adaptation and mitigation, for which it is considered strategic to direct national efforts to the contribution and contribution of compliance with the GGA and the Global Balance provided for in the Paris Agreement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, it is necessary to highlight that other fundamental reasons why Uruguay understands adaptation as a national priority are: i) high exposure: both due to the dependence on weather conditions, variability and climate change for the development of its main economic activities, such as agro-industrial production and a growing and dynamic tourism sector, as well as the location of the population, assets and main infrastructures in risk areas, considering, for example, that 70% of the Uruguayan population lives in the coastal departments; ii) high vulnerability: specifically due to the high sensitivity and susceptibility of the territorial spaces that concentrate both the main economic activities (such as the countryside, cities and coastal areas) as well as the most vulnerable social sectors and ecosystems, in the face of potential changes projected in the medium and long term; and iii) the still incipient capacities to respond and adapt to these increasingly evident changes.</p>
<p>7.2.1. National legal frameworks and institutional arrangements</p>
<p>The national frameworks for adaptation and complementary to those presented previously in this document, can be found in Figure 2, where the PNCC and ComAd1 are identified as the main legal and technical frameworks that, among other tools, give rise to the development of National Adaptation Plans; and the SNRCC as a horizontal coordination area which, by decree, is represented by public institutions, academia and non-governmental organizations, which investigate and work on climate change issues.</p>
                      <p><img width="978" height="438" alt="image" src="img/URY-NDC2-2.png"></p>
                      <p>Figure 2: Main Milestones for Adaptation and Risk Reduction in Uruguay.</p>
<p>At the time ComAd1 was submitted to the UNFCCC in 2017, Decision 9/CMA.1 guiding the preparation of adaptation communications had not yet been adopted. However, the elements included correspond to a great extent with those that were later incorporated in the annex of the Decision, forming a robust precedent in the negotiation process, as well as towards the elaboration of ComAd2.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Cancun Adaptation Framework and the Paris Agreement (art. 7.7) and given the adaptation by sector or by management area, Uruguay has prepared three national adaptation plans so far.</p>
<p>The <strong>PNA-Agro</strong> (2019) aims to guide the design, coordination and prioritization of policies, programs and projects that seek to address the climatic vulnerabilities of the different agricultural production systems and aims to to achieve a paradigm shift towards a resilient development path adapted to climate variability and change in the agricultural sector. [6]</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>NAP-Cities</strong> (2021) has been drawn up that seeks to reduce vulnerability to the effects of climate change by creating adaptation and resilience capacities in cities, infrastructures and urban environments ; and facilitate the integration of adaptation measures in a uniform way in the corresponding policies, programs and activities, both new and existing, in concrete development planning processes and strategies directed at cities and land use planning.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <strong>PNA-Coasts</strong> (2021) established as objectives to incorporate the adaptation perspective in the development and implementation of the coastal zone policy framework; Strengthen capacities at the national, departmental and municipal levels related to the management and adaptation of climate risk in coastal ecosystems through the training of human resources and the financing of specific actions, as appropriate in terms of budgetary powers at the respective levels of government, promoting</p>
<p>the preservation of coastal natural spaces and processes threatened by climate change and variability. Likewise, it is proposed to contribute to sustainable development with an equity perspective, seeking a more resilient, more adapted, and more conscious society in the coastal zone.</p>
<p>The <strong>PNA-E</strong> and the <strong>PNA-Health are being prepared.</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, Uruguay also submitted its ECLP to the UNFCCC in accordance with Article 4.19 of the Paris Agreement. The purpose of the ECLP is to agree on and make explicit a long-term vision in terms of GHG emissions and removals, as well as adaptation, resilience and risk reduction by 2050. In this way, the ECLP is inserted into the narrative of planning, implementation and monitoring of adaptation and resilience actions towards the middle of the century, according to climate science and in alignment with the assumed CO2 neutrality aspirational goal.</p>
<p>The aforementioned plans transversally integrate the gender perspective in a manner consistent with the principle of social equity considered in the PNCC, expressed in the National Gender and Climate Change Strategy (2019) and the National Gender and Climate Change Plan of the SNRCC (2021).</p>
<p>7.2.2. Impacts, adaptation and risk in Uruguay</p>
<p>Climate change carries risks, a consequence of the interaction of three components: threat or danger, exposure and vulnerability. Risks are the potential for adverse consequences to occur on a set of elements that make up a socio-technical system within an environment of uncertainty. [7] [8] These adverse consequences, that is, the materialization of risks, are manifested in the form of impacts that in turn can affect development and governance trajectories or threats directly or indirectly through climate change. [9]. The contextualization of adaptation to climate change in a risk framework arises to avoid or moderate damage, or take advantage of beneficial opportunities, through the planning, design and implementation of actions, activities, plans, programs and policies that generate the conditions to adjust for current or projected weather and its effects. [10]</p>
<p>Strategies for adaptation to climate change, within a risk framework and in line with the GGA established in the Paris Agreement, require efforts to increase the adaptive capacities and resilience of socio-ecological systems, and reduce vulnerabilities intrinsic to the systems and those derived from other socioeconomic processes that aggravate and enhance both the probability of occurrence and the magnitude of the impacts.</p>
<p>7.2.2.1. The effects of climate change in Uruguay</p>
<p>Uruguay is geographically located in a region of great climatic variability on all time scales, with an average annual temperature of 17.5°C, oscillating between about 20ºC in the northeast and around 16ºC on the Atlantic coast. This average has increased around 0.8ºC in the last 65 years, with the warming being greater in the Eastern zone in all seasons. [eleven]. During the summer in the northern region, temperatures comparable to those of the tropical regions are reached, while winter is a season of frequent cyclones and transitory anticyclones (5-7 days long) with warm and cold fronts that move latitudinally, generating damage to infrastructure and property along the coastal zone. [12].</p>
<p>Uruguay's climate shares characteristics with the southeastern region of South America and the climatic conditions of our region depend on factors that go beyond these geographical limits. On the one hand, a natural variability of the annual climate can be established, which induces very large changes in rainfall. The observations made indicate an increase of the order of 10-20% during the spring, summer and autumn seasons (1961-2017) in most of the country. Beyond the annual variations, the climate presents a </p>
<p>interdecadal variability, generating patterns of anomalies similar to those of El Niño, but with longer time scales. During the warm phase of these oscillations, El Niño events tend to be more frequent and intense than in the cold phase. [13]</p>
<p>Superimposed on natural variability is the signal of climate change, which is not restricted to a change in the average conditions of rainfall or temperature in a region, but is generally accompanied by changes in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of meteorological extremes (for example, cold and heat waves) and hydroclimatic (for example, droughts). According to various studies, the rise in sea level in Montevideo has been estimated at 11 cm, of which 2-3 cm correspond to the last three decades. [14] The variation is even more significant in the remaining tidal stations along the Uruguayan coast (La Paloma, Punta del Este, Colonia). [15]</p>
<p>In Uruguay, the most frequent phenomenon with the greatest impact is flooding [16], causing the evacuation of populations every year89 (between 2015 and 2019, 85,000 people evacuated and self-evacuated due to flooding alone) and affecting adequate livelihoods (food, housing, health), as well as economic losses derived from the loss and damage to goods and services owned by private property and the state. The most frequent types of flooding are riverbanks and ravines, coastal, storm drainage derived from the urbanization process and those related to failures in hydraulic infrastructures. Currently there are 11 localities with very high risk of flooding, 15 with high risk and 42 with medium risk, totaling 68 localities. [17]. It is worth clarifying that, although the largest number of registered affectations are derived from hydrometeorological phenomena10, anthropic and/or technological factors are not ruled out within the causes and aggravation of the impacts.</p>
<p>Agricultural production is especially sensitive to environmental conditions. The traditional climatic vulnerability is deepened as a product of climate change that results in production losses and variation in the production of crops and pastures. The most important climatic events due to the risks they imply for agricultural production are droughts, excessive rainfall, heat waves, frost, storms, strong winds, hail and lack of cold hours. In turn, the impacts vary in each production system [18] in the case of droughts, where different studies indicate that the worst droughts in the last 20 years were recorded in the years 1999/2000 (very severe), 2003/ 2004 (severe), 2008/2009 (very severe) 2011/2012 (severe) and 2017/2018 (severe) [19] with economic losses, linked to lower yields for most agribusiness sectors. In the pilot report on the evaluation of losses and damages due to events of climatic origin, for the year 2018, 32 types of events were identified that generated losses and damages of almost 564 million dollars. [20]</p>
<p>On the other hand, the energy sector continues to have a significant dependence on hydroelectricity, which is affected by the great variability in rainfall and, both floods and droughts, affect its availability, in a system that has little capacity to storage.</p>
<p>It is necessary to emphasize that Uruguay is working to collect more information, with a higher level of completeness, focused on the record of impacts and their respective evaluation of the losses and damages caused; the evaluation of actions to reduce vulnerability; and the economic evaluation of the implementation of adaptation measures to climate change.</p>
<p>7.2.2.2. Climate projections and scenarios for Uruguay</p>
<p>Climate projections for Uruguay for the 21st century (Figure 3) were based on ten models [21] that accurately represented Uruguay's climate; each model was run for the scenarios SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 for two time horizons; short term (2020-2044) and long term (2075-2099).</p>
<p>When contrasting the observed and simulated evolution of the average annual temperature in Uruguay for the period 1961-2014 with the projections for the end of the 21st century, an almost linear increase in the average annual temperature is observed, as well as differences at the regional level . The annual accumulated precipitation of Uruguay shows a high interannual variability that oscillates between -5 to 10% in the short-term horizon, and between -7 and 35% in the long-term horizon. [12]</p>
<p><img width="996" height="496" alt="Calendar Description automatically generated" src="img/URY-NDC2-3.png"></p>
<p>Figure 3: Model projections for temperature (CMIP5) and precipitation (CMIP6) at the seasonal level</p>
<p>Own preparation with data obtained from the Climate Projections report on Uruguay, Product carried out within the framework of the PNA-Coasts and the PNA-Cities, MVOTMA Agreement – Faculty of Sciences. [21]</p>
<p>Future projections show a gradual positive trend with a greater occurrence of extreme events. The interannual phenomenon with the greatest impact on rainfall in Uruguay is ENSO. The CMIP5 model shows that extreme events associated with ENSO tend to increase in frequency as global temperature increases. In addition, extreme events related to La-Niña could become more frequent, particularly three-month drought events on a short-term horizon. Heat waves in our country would increase in frequency and duration by the end of the century, mainly in the northern region. [12]</p>
<p>In turn, the average projected rise in sea level for the RCP8.5 scenario is 80 cm by the end of the century. The two typical situations that cause an extreme rise in the level of the Río de la Plata are related to coastal cyclogenesis and the arrival of fronts from the south. Along the coasts of the Río de la Plata and the Atlantic Ocean, flash floods are caused by a combination of meteorological and hydrological effects. The occurrence of high tides with large atmospherically induced storm waves raises the mean sea level three meters above its normal level, causing the removal of beaches and dunes, damage to coastal infrastructure, and risks to navigation. [15]</p>
<p>7.3. Ex ante adaptation cycle</p>
<p>7.3.1. Goals of adaptation</p>
<p>Article 7 of the Paris Agreement establishes the global objective related to adaptation, which consists of increasing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change with a view to contributing to sustainable development and achieving a climate response. appropriate adaptation in the context of the temperature objective mentioned in article 2<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> [ 1] With the purpose of linking national adaptation efforts with the elements established in the GGA, this adaptation communication has defined general objectives and specific objectives for each adaptation area, and an effort has also been made to establish the qualitative contribution of each of the proposed adaptation actions, in order to establish a strategic framework for the implementation of ComAd2.</p>
<p>The general objectives are:</p>
<p>Regarding the increase in adaptive capacity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Strengthen information systems for decision-making, generating, incorporating and improving information, with technical and scientific validation, linked to the consequences of climate change and the implementation of adaptation actions.</p>
<p>Regarding vulnerability reduction:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the impacts of climate change on socio-ecological systems; reducing losses and damages in the various productive areas and sectors, through the implementation of adaptation actions to climate change.</p>
<p>Regarding strengthening resilience:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen alliances for climate governance, regulatory, planning and technical instruments, with a transversal approach to climate change, especially adaptation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7.3.2. Cross-cutting approaches to adaptation</p>
<p>Climate change is transversal and, consequently, it is necessary to incorporate interdisciplinarity, the involvement of national, departmental and local government actors, and the participation of academia, civil society and the private sector. To achieve effective and efficient adaptation, adaptation is required to be part of state, national, and departmental agendas, plans, programs, and projects, and scientific, social, economic, and environmental studies and research.</p>
<p>It is essential to articulate across the different areas that have jurisdiction over adverse effects on biodiversity and ecosystems, water resources, human health, cities and territory, coastal areas and productive sectors, within a framework of climate risk, which not only moderates the impacts, but also reduces physical and social vulnerability and increases adaptive capacities.</p>
<p>This transversal approach must consider human rights, the gender perspective from an intersectional approach that recognizes vulnerabilities and respects differential capacities, generates the necessary conditions for the development and implementation of climate actions, increases knowledge, promotes awareness and community-based adaptation, reduce loss and damage, include ecosystem-based adaptation, strengthen climate services, and promote co-benefits with mitigation actions.</p>
<p>Within the transversal approaches, the National Gender and Climate Change Strategy stands out in 2019, with the aim of promoting the integration of this perspective in the implementation of the PNCC of Uruguay and in all policy instruments including the Nationally Determined Contributions, the National Adaptation Plans, the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification system, the INGEI and the Country Program of the Green Climate Fund. Likewise, in 2021 the Gender and Climate Change Action Plan was developed, which defines and prioritizes activities aimed at the objective of gender equality.</p>
<p>In light of the Strategy and the Action Plan, categories were established in relation to the potential impact of the measures to act against gender inequalities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Neutral: Does not involve integration of the gender perspective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensitive to Gender: It integrates the gender approach from the generation of basic information disaggregated by sex, but it does not necessarily imply corrective actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsive: Measures that integrate corrective actions for gender inequalities, recognition or reduction of gaps in sectors structured by gender; which may include transformative measures that promote cultural changes and structural changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blind/Potentially Sensitive or Responsive: Measures originally blind to gender that do not have information disaggregated by sex or contain corrective actions, but have a direct potential impact on gender gaps and/or the possibility of generating basic information to identify gaps. </p>
<p>As part of mainstreaming and in line with decision 9/CMA.1, the following communication is included for each measure: gender categorization, co-benefits with mitigation, losses and damages, the link with development objectives development and contributions to the global goal on adaptation. (see Annex 1)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7.3.3. National adaptation measures</p>
<p>The following are the specific objectives for adaptation to climate change and the respective measures, including the definition of their scope in terms of management and/or results, that Uruguay expects to achieve in order to contribute to the global objective related to adaptation. The measures identify the main priorities, by area and/or sector, information needs, implementation and support, adaptation plans and actions in order to moderate the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
<p>To implement the proposed measures, Uruguay may use implementation means to be provided within the framework of the Convention, both in terms of financing, technology transfer and creation and strengthening of capacities.</p>

</ol>
<p>7.4. Ex post adaptation cycle, progress and results obtained.</p>
<p>The main progress and results, barriers and challenges, and lessons learned and good practices achieved through the implementation of the main adaptation instruments in Uruguay are presented below.</p>
<p>7.4.1. First Nationally Determined Contribution and first Adaptation Communication of Uruguay</p>
<p>Main achievements and advances: The first CRC incorporates a series of instruments for adaptation planning, among which the NAPs stand out. The first generation of PNA, in addition to planning actions at the national level to face the consequences of climate change in five priority areas, develops, promotes and incorporates scientific knowledge by academic actors.</p>
<p>It stands out as an achievement to have designed and put into operation a system for the follow-up of the adaptation actions included in the ComAd1, through the definition of progress indicators in the implementation.</p>
<p>The categorization of the measures based on the potential impact on gender inequalities in accordance with the Gender and Climate Change Strategy and the Gender and Climate Change Action Plan, by virtue of the work of the Gender Working Group of the SNRCC constitutes evidence of the progress made and an effort for recognition that Uruguay seeks to make visible. This process involved multiple stakeholders, resulting in a capacity building process regarding the link between adaptation measures and gender inequalities.</p>
<p>Main barriers and challenges: The main challenges in ComAd1 focus on the resources available for the implementation of adaptation actions and the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation actions.</p>
<p>In terms of resources, an extensive mobilization of knowledge, technologies and financing is necessary for the design and implementation of actions that generate positive impacts. In addition, limited technical capacities in national institutions should be highlighted. Although there is a scope, willingness and special technical capacities for articulation within the SNRCC, it is necessary to strengthen them by including more representatives and improving participation within the various spheres of the SNRCC.</p>
<p>Regarding the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation actions, on the one hand, there are difficulties that arise from the multidimensional nature of adaptation that frames the system in an extensive series of multi-causal indicators whose temporal variation depends on the incidence of other factors environmental, social and economic. On the other hand, there is a lack of international benchmarks for adaptation in terms of i) development of indicators, ii) monitoring of policies, plans and measures, and iii) evaluation of the effectiveness towards reducing vulnerability, increasing resilience and disaster risk mitigation. [22]</p>
<p>Another great challenge is linked to the development and adoption of the NAPs, and how these will significantly contribute to the future monitoring of adaptation and vulnerability and their relationship with the next ComAds. Each NAP will have the challenge of generating an internal framework for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning, towards a long-term horizon (2050) through five-year action plans, equipped with a matrix of indicators to monitor each action stipulated in these , as well as its impact on the country's climate vulnerability.</p>
<p>From a gender perspective, the effort to make sectoral gender integration processes compatible with those of climate change is recognized, whether these are plans, strategies or independent projects. In addition, the definition of starting from gender analysis still faces the challenge of the lack of data disaggregated by sex, updated and available, mainly when it is at a local scale. Both processes require the deployment of technical resources and a specific budget allocation to be integrated into the Nationally Determined Contributions.</p>
<p>Main lessons learned and good practices: The decision to include an adaptation section in the first CRC, and that this was also considered the first Adaptation Communication as an integral part of the first CRC, brings greater visibility and visibility to adaptation and its balance with mitigation; highlights the adaptation efforts made by Uruguay by contributing information to the World Balance; and encourages achievements, good practices, needs, barriers and challenges to be better known and understood.</p>
<p>Seeking inter-institutional participation in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of adaptation actions, from an articulating perspective that requires the interdisciplinary involvement of various areas and sectors, fosters the multidimensional transversality of adaptation.</p>
<p>There is a firm commitment to continuous improvement in transparency in the monitoring of CDNs. The multidimensional and qualitative nature of adaptation creates challenges for accurate tracking based on numerical metrics. However, it has been possible to propose follow-up methodologies that manage to quantify the progress towards the goals of the adaptation measures of ComAd1.</p>
<p>The integration of the gender perspective has shown the relevance of generating enabling conditions for an intersectoral implementation based on: the creation of the stable Working Group with members representing the Specialized Units and/or Gender Commissions of each Ministry, coordinated by the DINACC of the MA and the governing body of public Gender Policies in the country, the National Institute for Women of the Ministry of Social Development; the establishment of a common intersectoral strategy, which established the common criteria to integrate the gender perspective in the first CRC, including the National Adaptation Plans; and the establishment of possible goals and the incorporation of gender categorization in the CRC monitoring viewer, of a public nature.</p>
<p>7.4.2. National Adaptation Plans</p>
<p>The PNCC offers a strategic framework to face the challenges of climate change and variability through adaptation. The First CRC, as an instrument for the implementation of said Policy, prioritizes within the ComAd1, the development, approval and start of the implementation of National Adaptation Plans: PNA for Coastal Zones, PNA in Cities and Infrastructures, PNA for the Agricultural sector ; PNA in Energy and PNA in health, based on detailed information on threats, exposure, sensitivities and adaptation capacities of socio-ecological systems.</p>
<p>Both the incorporation of local, technical and scientific knowledge on the consequences of climate change, as well as decision-making to respond to its effects, were defined in accordance with the thematic particularities behind each PNA and the planning of the adaptation actions focused on iterative consultation and adjustment mechanisms with actors representing the specific area or sector. The SNRCC has been an active actor in each one of the processes of elaboration of the NAPs.</p>
<p>7.4.2.1. National Adaptation Plan for the Coastal Zone (PNA – Coasts)</p>
<p>Main achievements and advances: The transfer of knowledge from international researchers (IH-Cantabria) to local researchers (Universidad de la República) and government entities was ensured through the implementation of training strategies for technicians, professionals and decision makers of Ministries and local governments.</p>
<p>In addition, the following stand out: coordination between administrations and integration of competencies beyond the fragmentation of the sector; regional cooperation in addressing common problems; a long-term vision with an adaptive management approach; the provision of a general framework that can be addressed to local specificities and at different scales, from the national to the local.</p>
<p>Uruguay developed shared ownership platforms (Observatorio Ambiental Nacional; Visor del Sistema de Seguimiento de la CRC), to ensure the long-term sustainability of the adoption of climate modeling and vulnerability assessment technology as well as foster exchange of information and knowledge between all levels of government and between academic and civil society networks.</p>
<p>To date, the PNA-Costas is conceived as a working method that recognizes all the priorities related to climate variability and change throughout the decision-making processes. In this sense, this mechanism aims to cover all the necessary structures to generate the knowledge that will be applied at the time of strategic planning.</p>
<p>Main barriers and challenges: Coastal adaptation comes with many challenges. Responses to climate change in the coastal zone should be multidisciplinary, socially complex, long-term, and flexible to change. Without effective adaptation to the impacts of coastal climate change there will be major implications for Uruguayan society and the long-term sustainability of the coastal zone. Governments, businesses, communities and individuals all have a role in responding to climate change. However, the role of governments will be particularly important as effective adaptation actions will be largely supported by planning reform and updated building codes and practices led by the PNCC.</p>
<p>Identified technical barriers to addressing the impacts of climate variability and change in the coastal area included lack of quality data or lack of access to existing data, methodologies and tools to assess climate change risks and to implement adaptation measures or establish metrics and procedures to evaluate adaptation processes. Other barriers included coordination between the national and local levels and the lack of qualified human resources.</p>
<p>Historical databases and high-resolution dynamics projections produced by national researchers were necessary to quantify the impact at the local scale. The improved national database and information systems on variables associated with marine dynamics now also serve as a reference for integrated coastal zone management, operational oceanography, infrastructure construction, coastal zone risk management, the resilience of ecosystems and tourism management.</p>
<p>Understanding the local impacts of climate change is an inherently dynamic process, and ongoing assessment and adjustment are necessary to propose effective adaptation measures. For ten years (2012-2022) Uruguay has focused on promoting the reduction of existing gaps in knowledge and the diagnosis of coastal vulnerability through public consultation activities on the need for adaptation measures.</p>
<p>Finally, most of the measures that could imply the participation of the private sector do not present, at least in the short term, economic benefits or profitability; the assets that will be affected mainly are public goods (beaches, boulevards, port infrastructures) so the investment and initiative will be mainly from the state. In this context, it should be properly identified what incentives the private sector (households, companies, financial sector) could have to get involved and design the most appropriate instruments to channel this participation, certainly including public and private collaboration, and at the national and subnational level</p>
<p>Main lessons learned and good practices: Evidence indicates that adaptation planning at the national level is stimulating adaptation planning at the departmental level. The maturity of the adaptation planning instruments varies according to the departmental governments. Efforts to access financing for adaptation have been strengthened and the development of technical assistance supported by national, departmental and multilateral funds has increased.</p>
<p>The successful adoption of climate modeling technology has not only allowed Uruguay to develop its NAP-Coasts, but also to improve its capacity and secure financing for the implementation of adaptation measures. Therefore, the adoption of new technological developments has directly led to the achievement of two of the country's CRC's key adaptation objectives.</p>
<p>The co-creation of knowledge, the generation of capacities and the implementation of adaptation measures were coordinated among the six departmental governments through the execution of 103 workshops to evaluate the perception of local actors, the incorporation of knowledge of the scientific community and the design of adaptation responses to climate change. A total of 210 actions were identified, of which 33% referred to capacity building in departmental governments, 26% focused on coastal space planning, and 25% proposed knowledge creation and the search for solutions. technological.</p>
<p>By promoting the EbA approach throughout adaptation planning, initiatives for the implementation of sand-capturing fences were supported, which were successful in the medium and long term for the recovery of dune dynamics, and which included the participation of the local community and of the academy in different cases. This has made it possible to generate evidence on the benefits of EbA versus other types of harsh measures, a path that is essential to deepen.</p>
<p>The gender approach makes it possible to measure inequalities in access to and control of resources, as well as in participation in decision-making in the coastal zone. The technology made it possible to assess the physical vulnerability from which the potentially affected social composition could be determined. In addition to the general impact on housing, the alteration of the coastal area is also relevant because it serves recreational purposes and as a transit area for essential services, including the areas of health, education, and access to employment. A gender approach was essential to analyze the differential uses and determine precisely how this affectation will be, which allows establishing social vulnerability from a process that integrates the needs of the population according to their specific reality.</p>
<p>7.4.2.2. National Adaptation Plan for Cities and Infrastructures (PNA – Cities)</p>
<p>Main achievements and advances: The advances generated in institutional processes such as the preparation of departmental plans for comprehensive risk management, climate action, storm drainage and urban water, and plans and ordinances for trees, among others, stand out. </p>
<p>Regarding education and training, lines of work for research, teaching and extension related to adaptation to climate variability and change (AVCC) were promoted. Among these are some such as curricular courses, professional training activities, permanent education and non-formal education, climate research programs, public spaces and buildings, sustainable drainage, nature-based solutions (NbS), new technologies and materials, and design of specific projects.</p>
<p>Main barriers and challenges: One of the main challenges of the PNA-Cities refers to the formulation, coordination, implementation and monitoring of five-year action plans that follow up, promote and implement the adaptation actions identified and prioritized in the time of its preparation. This can only be achieved by maintaining the principle of flexibility and adaptive management of the plan, imprinting on knowledge improvement, and continuous monitoring, evaluation, and learning from each implementation cycle.</p>
<p>Another relevant challenge is linked to the continuity of alliances and the allocation of resources, through future changes in administrations and political authorities that are generated during the implementation horizon of the PNA-Cities.</p>
<p>In some institutions, changes in administration and authorities have brought changes in priorities and discontinuity in certain key activities for adaptation; in some cases, after a period of slowdown, the technical teams are resuming them, favoring continuity in climate policies and commitments.</p>
<p>It is also pertinent to point out that there are lines of work that still need to be prioritized. Especially the development and application of guides for the planning or application of AVCC measures in different fields and the carrying out of studies on different topics.</p>
<p><i><strong>Main lessons learned and good practices</strong></i><strong>:</strong> Articulation in adaptation processes is key to ensuring their implementation and continuity. During the PNA-Cities process, many of the enabling conditions were prepared for the development of the activities of the Uruguay-Argentina Regional Project: Adaptation to Climate Change in Cities and Vulnerable Coastal Ecosystems of the Uruguay River12, to be implemented between 2021 and 2024 and constituting an opportunity to apply and evaluate AVCC measures.</p>
<p>The Uruguay-Argentina Regional project, as an articulating instrument between adaptation planning and implementation, includes actions such as: diagnosis and restoration of key ecosystems for adaptation; strengthening networks in the territory to increase resilience in vulnerable communities; the redefinition of land located in areas at high risk of flooding through the creation of public parks.</p>
<p>One of the best practices to highlight focuses on ensuring the continuity of the technical approach to the planning work, articulated with the implementation. In this sense, it is worth noting that the technical committee for the revision and formulation of the PNA-Cities, has a role of promotion and implementation, as a driving force<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"> <sup>13</sup></a> representative of State institutions related to the issue.</p>
<p>The PNA-Cities, in addition to incorporating the gender perspective and generations with a human rights approach as a guiding principle of the document, categorizes all measures according to their potential impact on gender inequalities. Within the interactive tool for monitoring the 41 measures of the PNA, you can see the relationship of their potential impact on gender inequalities, with respect to threats, the strategic lines of the document, by department and locality.</p >
<p>Regarding the EbA and NBS approach, within the framework of the PNA-Cities, a guide was generated on key ecosystems for adaptation in Uruguayan cities to deal with floods, coastal erosion and high temperatures, intended in particular to be used in territorial planning instruments such as local plans. This is a starting point to strengthen the basic information on ecosystem services for adaptation to climate change in cities. The Uruguay-Argentina Regional project includes among its expected results the generation of evidence regarding the benefits of NBS for adaptation, both on a micro scale, with the implementation of green and blue infrastructure in a city in Uruguay, and on a macro scale. , with the incorporation of adaptation measures in a protected area, under the concept that maintaining ecosystems in a good state of conservation increases resilience at the territory level.</p>
<p>7.4.2.3. National Adaptation Plan for the Agricultural Sector (PNA-Agro)</p>
<p>Main achievements and advances: Since 2019, the PNA-Agro has been a strategic instrument to guide public policies with a long-term vision around the productive, environmental, social and institutional dimensions. It seeks to integrate adaptation actions to climate variability and change for the agricultural sector and, at the same time, identify gaps in knowledge and capacities to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and variability, building adaptive capacity and resilience. It also seeks to integrate the issue coherently into agricultural development policies and adaptation plans at the national level.</p>
<p>Since 2019, regarding the implementation of the co-innovation approach, to promote ecological intensification strategies in livestock systems, the Livestock and Climate project is being implemented<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14 "><sup>14</sup></a>. To date, without a significant increase in the use of inputs, the production per animal and per surface unit and the economic income have improved. This improvement in resilience was achieved while verifying a reduction in GHG emissions per ha and a decrease in the intensity of GHG emissions per kg. The results of two years of project implementation in an adverse climatic context show a way to build resilience in natural range-based livestock systems through forage and herd management.</p>
<p>In 2022 the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries began the implementation of the SARU<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> project that addresses the four dimensions of the 2050 strategy of the PNA-Agro.</p>
<p>The project will implement various actions in line with the PNA-Agro that contribute to property sustainability processes through the promotion of biodiversity in the property system, maintenance or restoration of natural areas, and the protection and efficient use of resources. natural resources, maintaining or increasing ecosystem services. Likewise, priority was given to equipping with technologies and infrastructure for effluent management, and the development of a pilot project that seeks to facilitate access to yield and/or investment insurance for summer crops, by granting economic support to farmers. participating producers.</p>
<p>Main barriers and challenges: The monitoring of the progress in the implementation of the PNA-Agro detected that there are gaps in the information to report the framework of indicators. Only 53% of the indicators could be fully reported. For the rest of the indicators there are gaps in the information or there are no sources of information for their calculation. Although the progress in adaptation in agricultural systems requires a multidimensional analysis, it can be affirmed that progress was detected for the calculated indicators.</p>
<p>Regarding the 2025 action plan, the evaluation of the PNA-Agro allows us to identify some challenges: a) The implementation was affected by both changes in financing sources and budget availability; b) Some measures were difficult to evaluate since the work plans do not have specific quantifiable goals; c) The most common barriers identified during the process of evaluating the implementation of the PNA-Agro action plan are the lack of institutional capacities, lack of sources of financing, institutional articulation difficulties, barriers to the adoption and transfer of technologies for productive systems adapted to climate variability and change.</p>
<p>Main lessons learned and good practices: Periodic monitoring is key to assessing the progress of the PNA-Agro and guiding policies that contribute to the proposed objectives. In 2022, the indicators matrix and the action plan were monitored. The exercise showed the need to strengthen the statistics and indicators and the capacity to continue monitoring and verify that the indicators are capturing the particularities of adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>Regarding the Action Plan, a series of initiatives and projects were implemented with an institutional integration approach that seek to achieve at the same time an improvement in the resilience of production systems promoting agroecological transitions that allow an improvement in the use and conservation of natural resources, improve the living conditions of people who work in the sector and at the same time provide benefits for the reduction of GHG emitters.</p>
<p>Some of the lines of work implemented since the launch of the PNA-agro are highlighted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advance in lines of research in integrated work with the National Institute of Agricultural Research and the University of the Republic that generate inputs to help develop production systems less vulnerable to climate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of the National System of Innovation and Rural Development -SNIDER in order to direct, articulate and coordinate the design and implementation of the different actions aimed at Sustainable Rural Development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information and monitoring of the agroclimatic situation to improve decision-making for climate risk management in agricultural establishments: Monthly monitoring of indicators such as Available Water in soils, rainfall and its anomalies, Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Standardized Precipitation Index, Forest Risk Index, Bovine Heat Stress Index, among others. In conjunction with the MGAP National Agricultural Information System (SNIA), the INIA Agro-Climate and Information Systems Unit (GRAS Unit) and the Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (INUMET)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The PNA-Agro includes the gender perspective as a transversal aspect and especially addresses the role of rural women. As part of the process for the elaboration of the PNA-Agro, nine Adaptation Dialogues were carried out to which rural women who carry out activities in dairy, livestock and horticultural production systems were convened. At the same time, a survey was carried out in dairy, livestock and horticultural establishments on a family and medium scale, including gender aspects, in order to obtain differentiated information.</p>
<p>The 2025 Action Plan also incorporated specific measures such as: the incorporation of gender mainstreaming actions into policies to support family production; the implementation of affirmative policies focused on rural women and youth; the emphasis on the integration of women as recipients in the framework of promoting the adoption of Good Agricultural Practices and the integrated management of pests, diseases and weeds. The document incorporates measures from the 2025 Action Plan that are gender-sensitive and some aimed at young people. Among them, the implementation of affirmative policies focused on rural women and youth. Regarding the indicators of the 2050 Strategy, some are gender sensitive, such as the one referring to access to agro-climatic information, belonging to rural organizations, training processes and access to funds, among other aspects.</p>
<p>7.4.2.4. National Health Adaptation Plan (PNA-Health)</p>
<p>Main achievements and advances: Uruguay is currently beginning the process to prepare its PNA-Health. In the first instance, key actors from the academy, professional societies and international agencies have been identified, while the technical teams of the Ministry of Public Health have been made aware of climate change and health.</p>
<p>Main barriers and challenges: In the process of developing this Plan, it has been identified that climate change is not only an environmental health problem but also a threat to general public health [23]. For this reason, the formation of a technical group on health and climate change made up of different areas (Directors, Divisions, Departments and Programs) that make up the organizational structure of the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) has been proposed.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges in terms of climate change is given by vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever and leishmaniasis. Both, with clear climatic conditioning in their transmission cycle, have emerged in an epidemic manner in the last decade in Uruguay</p>
<p>[24] [25] however, the challenge lies in generating models that consider environmental viability, as well as other determinants, such as population movements, ecology of vectors and reservoirs, and sociocultural conditions.</p>
<p>Another great challenge will be to mainstream health into the climate agenda. Currently, the focus is on the adaptation of the sector to face the challenges of climate change. However, it would be desirable that the health benefits of measures in other sectors such as agriculture, energy, or transportation be considered and estimated.</p>
<p>7.4.2.5. National Energy Adaptation Plan (PNA-E)</p>
<p>Main achievements and advances: The PNA-E is in its preparation phase, and it is expected to be completed in 2023. The first milestone in the preparation process dates back to 2020, when a roadmap was drawn up for the preparation of the plan. In this stage, consultation workshops were held with actors from the academy, government, public and private sectors, which allowed to identify, in a preliminary way, the vulnerabilities of the energy system to climate, and the information and knowledge gaps existing in the country.</p>
<p>The second stage of this preliminary phase was carried out in 2021-2022, delving into the governance of the Plan, the structuring of the PNA-E and the definition of the studies to be carried out for the analysis of climate risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Governance: A Steering Committee was created, made up of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining (MIEM) -the institution that leads the PNA-E-, the MA, the public energy companies UTE and ANCAP, and the OPP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structure of the PNA-E: The main lines of action for the definition of measures were defined: energy supply and energy demand; Assurance / protection of current and future infrastructure; Weather emergency management / disaster risk reduction; Awareness raising, institutional strengthening and capacity building; Integration of adaptation into energy and climate planning processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of Climatic Risks and Vulnerabilities: a study was defined under the robust decision-making methodology (RDM) for the analysis of the electricity sector, framed within the decision-making methods under deep uncertainty (DMDU) . These methods are suitable for the development of robust and adaptive policy strategies, in contexts of high uncertainty, such as those that exist particularly in the energy sector and in the climate issue. Work is currently underway to define local teams for the implementation of the studies during 2023.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Main barriers and challenges: Some information and knowledge gaps have been identified for carrying out projection studies of climate variables relevant to the energy sector; in particular, long and consistent series of solar irradiance, average speed and gusts of winds, among others. These databases have begun to be built in the country from the installation of wind farms and photovoltaic solar energy, but their data have series of around 10 years old, in the best of cases.</p>
<p>Regarding the extremes, much more punctual phenomena that are difficult to observe and predict, such as electrical storms, hail, extreme winds and precipitation; they are more difficult to study due to the lack of instruments and adequate measurement networks.</p>
<p>On the side of the analysis of the impacts of these phenomena on the supply, infrastructure and users of energy, the record of damages and losses in the country is also challenging, an aspect that will constitute one of the focuses of action of the PNA- E.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the mainstreaming of the concept of adaptation in the energy sector is also a challenge on which the PNA-E will take action, through measures that seek to improve the understanding of the subject by all actors in the sector. industry.</p>
<p>In particular, the energy sector and, mainly, the electricity sector, already have a long history of adaptive response measures, mainly to the conditions of variability of resources for hydroelectric generation; since this represents approximately 40-50% of electricity generation and the high interannual variability of rainfall generates highly changing supply scenarios. Although this can be an advantage, it also generates an inertia that is sometimes difficult to break when other dynamics of availability of energy resources must be incorporated in the long term, due to climate change.</p>
<p>Main lessons learned and good practices: The fact that the preparation process is being carried out in a participatory manner with the main actors in the sector (academia, government, state companies, private companies, etc.) in order to include the different visions and move forward together, facilitates understanding and, without a doubt, will facilitate the stage of preparation, discussion and implementation of adaptation measures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for the development and implementation of the Plan, the leadership and commitment shown by the government is essential, as well as coordination with the entire mitigation and adaptation ecosystem in the country, which is carried out through of the SNRCC.</p>
<p>7.5. Adaptation efforts to be recognized</p>
<p>Planning: Uruguay has devoted significant time and resources to strengthening adaptation planning by areas and by sectors, as well as the inclusion of cross-cutting issues, including climate risk management, climate risk mapping, flooding and territorial planning, with an imprint of transversality of gender, diversities, human rights and generations, throughout the process.</p>
<p>Training, Sensitization and Participation: In the process of elaboration of the PNCC, the NAPs and the CDN there has been an advance to be highlighted in the mainstreaming and weight of adaptation in public policies and in development policies, in relation to to the process of the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda (SDG). To achieve this, the coordinating role of the SNRCC and the departmental governments has been substantial. It is highlighted, in turn, that these documents were made in a participatory manner, which has reinforced legitimacy and awareness. The gender issue, as a transversal aspect in policies, has also been made visible and implemented through said processes. The work of the technical teams has been remarkable and has been strengthened over time by improving the planning, communication and reporting systems.</p>
<p>Integration of the perspective of childhood and adolescence: Uruguay has made progress in integrating the perspective of adolescents and young people, with the recognition of their right to participate in the design of the second CRC and helping to strengthen training and education aspects. empowerment. The challenge of increasing sensitivity to children is raised in a transversal way, recognizing that boys and girls bear a disproportionate part of the burden imposed by climate change. Extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves pose unique threats to the health and well-being of children. Vulnerability to climate change is visible in the economic, physiological, social, political and environmental dimensions, and for this reason, it is a priority that climate change commitments defined from different public policies are sensitive to children.</p>
<p>Relocations as a housing policy: Uruguay has advanced in the process of mainstreaming adaptation to climate change in housing policies, where relocation policies, promoted and monitored by the first CDN, constitute concrete efforts for recognition, highlighting that these actions are carried out with national financing.</p>
<p>Ecosystem-Based Adaptation: Uruguay has prioritized adaptation measures with a focus on EbA in the processes of preparing its NAPs. The efforts made for its implementation can be identified in coastal management, specifically in pilot sites that have made it possible to validate its effectiveness and replicability throughout the coastal zone. In addition, sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) have been implemented in several cities, in a joint effort between the national and departmental governments and academia, laying the foundations to incorporate this approach into the development of the future National Urban Drainage Plan. </p>
<p>Diversification of the energy matrix: Uruguay has stood out and stands out for being one of the countries with the highest proportion of renewable energy in its electricity matrix, despite being a developing country. This transformation, which has been carried out early and with a national effort, has allowed not only a rapid decarbonization of the electricity matrix but also an increase in energy sovereignty and a decrease in the uncertainty of the demand supply cost (CAD). On the other hand, in relation to adaptation to climate change, the first energy transition can be considered as a great adaptation measure. The diversification of the electrical matrix towards non-traditional renewable sources has made it possible to reduce dependence on one of the fundamental sources of electrical energy in our country, hydraulic energy, which is affected by AVCC. The installed capacity in other energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass has made it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the system in the face of low hydraulicity which, before the energy transition, led to the use of significant percentages of fossil fuels as an alternative and complementary energy source. The country currently has an electrical system that allows it to maintain very high levels of renewable sources even if the hydraulic levels are below or much below the historical average, thanks to the diversification of its electrical matrix.</p>
<p>Flood risk maps (MDRI): Currently in Uruguay there are 11 localities with very high risk of flooding, 15 with high risk and 42 with medium risk, totaling 68 localities. Of these, 9 have an MDRI approved by the departmental board, 7 have an MDRI prepared, another 7 are in the process of being prepared, and in 27 cities there are advances and studies carried out. In addition to the efforts to create new risk maps, the first updates of some already prepared ones are being made. Risk mapping is a dynamic process, the information available for risk characterization is increasing and of better quality, and the dynamics in the territory are changing, in this sense it seeks to get closer to the best possible risk map with updates. </p>
<p>Integration of the gender approach: The integration of the gender perspective involved technicians and decision makers with different initial levels of approach to the subject, which resulted in a strengthening of capacities regarding the link between the measures of the first CDN and inequalities. In this first phase, specifying the categorization of 100% of the measures involved in the first CRC implied mobilizing strategies to generate capacities and various sensitizations in the perspective of gender and climate change respectively, as well as sectoral gender analyzes that would allow the identification of gaps and specific risks. The review and update carried out on the first categorization of the year 2021, showed a significant increase in gender-responsive measures, realizing that there is a set of gender-responsive actions involved, which are integrated into the respective planning.</p>
<p>7.6. Barriers and challenges to implementing adaptation</p>
<p>One of the main challenges is to ensure that adaptation is included as a fundamental part of the country's development strategy, under a framework for climate risk management that includes flexible adaptation measures to the socio-territorial context, so that it is possible to moderate or avoid irreversible damage and, simultaneously, generate co-benefits.</p>
<p>Long-term planning and the human and financial resources allocated for this purpose, can be conflicting between the areas that suffer current difficulties. An important issue for the success of these initiatives is to reduce current climate vulnerability, while strengthening the adaptive capacity of the population and strengthening the resilience of the systems. Development objectives are consistent with adaptation goals, especially when they offer co-benefits such as investments that improve income and increase tolerance to climatic stressors (such as high temperatures, lack of water, and floods). Development gains often increase human capital (and other types of capital) and could improve adaptive capacity to climate change. It is highlighted that, in several areas, the most attractive adaptation measures are those that offer development benefits in the short term and reduce vulnerability in the long term. In this sense, adaptation costs will initially be allocated to preventive measures, while in the long term reactive measures will increase in importance.</p>
<p>In accordance with the ComAd2 preparation process, explained in section 7.1.2, a workshop16 was held with the SNRCC institutional technical references linked to adaptation, in which the following barriers to the implementation of adaptation:</p>
<p><i><strong>Knowledge and Technology</strong></i>: the lack of knowledge, the lack of access to information and the difficulty in accessing it are severe limitations for adaptation. Several limitations associated with this category were detected in the country: i) Lack of climate information: the scarcity and lack of data recording and the difficulty in obtaining high-resolution, high-quality, and continuous climate, oceanic, and hydrological series, together with The existence of few complete national studies poses challenges to face changes in climate variability, and the identification of trends in the impacts of extreme events. This situation makes it difficult to study the frequency and variability of the frequency and magnitude of extreme events, as well as the analysis of impacts and vulnerability to the present and future climate. ii) Lack of studies associated with climate action and inaction: Studies linked to the cost benefit of the implementation of adaptation actions and the avoided costs, as well as the recording of impacts related to events derived from climate change and variability in the greater part of the areas (agriculture, water resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, coasts, health, cities) to improve the assessment of losses and damages .iii) Lack of adequate dissemination of information: studies are often reflected in reports internal with little diffusion and difficult access. This limits knowledge and hinders its progress, in addition to generating overlapping and repetition of activities. iv) Lack of integrated and interdisciplinary studies: the complex interactions between climate and non-climate forcing make it difficult to assess impacts and projections, limiting the understanding of the complex interactions between natural and socioeconomic systems.</p>
<p>Governance: Institutional capacity is a key factor that can potentially constrain the adaptation process. In several institutions, the lack of mandate or prioritization of the subject, as well as the lack of information or professional capacity to select and apply the adaptation options constitute a limitation. The lack of coordination between the various members of the governance networks (government agents, market agents, non-governmental organizations) is usually a relevant national limitation. Therefore, the challenge in adaptation planning and implementation is to determine “who” decides which are the appropriate or maladaptive options and which option is successful or not. The exchange of ideas between sectors with different visions and interests is necessary to try to reconcile positions and be able to move forward in a consensual manner. The constant and varied interactions between climatic, environmental, economic and social factors highlight the need to address inclusive actions that take into account the various challenges faced by human and natural systems.</p>
<p>Financing for climate action: Uruguay is a country particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate variability and change. This is especially due to its open economy based heavily on agro-industrial production and services, and the important tourism sector centered on the coastal zone, which is home to more than 70% of the country's population. In the pilot report on the evaluation of losses and damages due to events of climatic origin, for the year 2018, 32 types of events were identified that generated losses and damages of almost 564 million dollars. The country has made significant progress in establishing the baseline, diagnosis and adaptation planning, through the completion of three NAPs and the initiation of the elaboration of another two. It is therefore essential to have financing that allows progress from planning to the effective implementation of the adaptation measures identified as priorities through the CND2 and the NAPs.</p>
<p>Access to financing for the implementation of adaptation is a political priority for Uruguay, without prejudice to the fact that, in a complementary way, the country has stood out as a pioneer in the implementation of early mitigation measures. The access and availability of financing sources for adaptation actions continues to be a challenge, at the national and mainly subnational level, both from international sources and from public sources. Additional international resources are needed to address adaptation, both through traditional and innovative mechanisms. Addressing the adaptation as soon as possible helps to avoid costs in the future, related to loss and damage. In this sense, it is necessary that adaptation be understood in its strategic importance and that there be a response at a global level that tends to balance the resources allocated to mitigation and adaptation in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Involvement of the private sector: Adaptation to the impacts of climate change is not the sole responsibility of governments, but requires the cooperation of multiple parties [26]. Within this framework, involving the private sector in the identification of climate change risks, as well as in response and adaptation measures is a priority for Uruguay. Although in the first instance the attention is focused on the role of the private financial sector (risk management options, insurance or financing of large projects), the implementation of adaptation actions is broader and covers different types of private companies; whether they are small farmers, small and medium-sized companies or even multinational companies [27]. This diversity of actors requires a greater effort to identify the different motivations and incentives that will guide their actions and the potential for them to participate in the different adaptation strategies and measures. On the one hand, productive activity generates impacts that can reduce the adaptive capacities of a territory (eg, impacts on coastal ecosystems) or of certain communities. On the other hand, the risk linked to the effects of climate change is greater for certain production chains or business lines. Companies' vision of the need to adapt is conditioned by several factors: their previous experiences, to the extent that companies that have already experienced negative impacts due to current climate variability and extreme events tend to be more committed to adaptation to climate change; if the affectation or impact is registered on public assets (eg, beaches) or private assets (agricultural production); the uncertainty of future climate impacts and the short-term horizon used in business management.</p>
<p>[28] In addition, companies would be more willing to adapt if they receive incentives or subsidies to help them cope. Finally, given the research requirements that these processes entail, the</p>
<p>providing guidance on knowledge, technology and information for this sector becomes a key challenge when it comes to facilitating the incorporation of adaptation into the business models of companies.</p>
<p>Ecosystem-Based Adaptation: although Uruguay prioritizes the EbA approach in its planning, it is necessary to increase efforts to associate ecosystem functions and services at the territorial level with the reduction of specific vulnerabilities, build cases and good practices that include analysis cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness, and make EbA explicit when used. With this approach, it is necessary to strengthen technical capacities at the national and subnational levels, as well as those of the private sector, such as infrastructure and construction service companies. If it is a challenge to access financing for adaptation, it is even greater when it comes to EbA since it requires a greater effort in the initial design of the solutions and the analysis of their cost-effectiveness. For this reason, it is key to generate EbA knowledge applied to the territory and make it visible as an effective alternative, with a focus on environmental integrity.</p>
<p>Political Will: in some cases it generates constraints or barriers that slow down the planning and implementation of adaptation options and reduce the range of options and opportunities available for action, generating tensions between long-term needs and action in the future. short term. Sometimes administrative changes produce changes in priorities in the agendas and discontinuity of plans, programs and projects. It is necessary to strengthen capacities at all levels of public administration, in order to align the objectives and paths for development and make visible the synergies and co-benefits between adaptation measures and improvements in environments, infrastructure and quality of people's lives.</p>
<p>7.7. Good practices and lessons learned:</p>
<p>Interinstitutional, multilevel and transdisciplinary governance. The generation of an inter-institutional governance framework and a multilevel and transdisciplinary approach to adaptation to climate change is a good practice to highlight, which Uruguay intends to maintain and deepen. The adaptation measures of the CDN1 and ComAd1 are implemented within the framework of the SNRCC and the PNAs created their respective technical committees within the framework of the SNRCC that remained as the technical sphere of decision and advice throughout the development of the planning of the adaptation in each sector or territory. These committees were made up of technicians from each unit of the SNRCC institutions with competencies in the productive sector or territory addressed, experts from the University of the Republic, and representatives of departmental governments.</p>
<p>Create and maintain a national inter-institutional environment where shared objectives for adaptation to climate change are established, adaptation actions are designed, implemented, monitored and evaluated, progress is shared transparently and transdisciplinary participation is ensured, allows enrich results, institutionalize processes, and build capacities at the national, subnational, and academic levels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, evidence indicates that adaptation planning at the national level is stimulating adaptation planning at the departmental level. Multilevel governance allows for dialogue between the national and departmental levels, and the encouragement and progress of some departments in adaptation planning and implementation, resulting in a maturity of adaptation planning instruments that varies across departmental governments. These are key components to ensure the sustainability of adaptation in Uruguay and that planning is transformed into implementation based on local contexts.</p>
<p>Ecosystem-Based Adaptation. Considering that adaptive capacities depend on environmental integrity, the conservation of biodiversity and the health of ecosystems, and recognizing the role that they can play in the design of solutions, the EbA approach to design has been strengthened. of the ComAd2 measures, increasing the number and ambition of the measures in the area of biodiversity and ecosystems in comparison with ComAd1, as well as mainstreaming the approach in other areas.</p>
<p><i><strong>Transparency, monitoring, evaluation and learning.</strong></i> The relevance of measuring and reporting adaptation to climate change has been demonstrated. The methodologies used to monitor the adaptation measures of ComAd1, which managed to quantify the progress towards the proposed goals, have made it possible to translate the meaning of adaptation for the local context into specific methodological processes, define the baseline and estimate the progress on adaptation priorities, as well as how far to go. Due to the multidimensional and qualitative nature of adaptation, it is necessary to update and improve these methodological processes for a much more precise follow-up, from the moment the measures are designed. In turn, it is important to establish a mechanism for monitoring, evaluation and learning of the measures based on the progress in their implementation since adaptive management is a fundamental part of the processes of adaptation to climate change. Likewise, the definition of metrics and indicators for monitoring adaptation measures has made it possible to identify crossovers, co-benefits and on some occasions <i>trade-offs</i> with climate change mitigation measures. In this way, the synergies between adaptation and mitigation, and possible points of conflict are made visible, which is key to ensuring the efficiency of the efforts and resources allocated to implementing the measures, as well as to reporting their progress.</p >
<p>Generation of freely accessible information and data. It is recognized as a priority to improve the adaptive capacities of the country and productive sectors, the existence of quality and freely accessible data and records on hydroclimatic events at a national and regional scale within the country, as well as the losses and damages generated by the same. Uruguay has made important progress in terms of its governance and open data policy, in the generation of integrated information systems and viewers, and in the collection of evidence and data, which it must continue to strengthen.</p>
<p>Stakeholder engagement. A lesson learned is that there is will and interest on the part of local communities, civil society associations, micro, small and medium-sized companies, the third level of government and young people -as affected actors, but also as drivers of development through local level - to participate in the identification of vulnerabilities and the planning and implementation of solutions to increase adaptive capacity and manage risks in the face of climate change. In this sense, it has been detected that it is necessary to develop or strengthen processes and tools adapted to the areas of activity of each interest group to ensure increasingly efficient participation.</p>
<p><i>Integration of the gender approach</i>. The review and update of the gender measures of the ComAd1 carried out on the first categorization of the year 2021, showed a significant increase in measures responsive to gender, realizing that there is a set of gender responsive actions involved, which are integrated into the respective planning.</p>
<p>7.8. Cooperation to improve adaptation at the national, regional and international levels</p>
<p>In a framework of climate risk, with increasingly frequent and severe impacts and in an environment of uncertainty, it is essential to strengthen the areas of cooperation at the national, regional and international levels to improve the implementation of adaptation actions </p>
<p>At the national level, Uruguay has the SNRCC, a forum for inter-institutional technical exchange, made up of different ministries and other organizations, such as the Mayors' Congress, various actors from civil society and academia.</p>
<p>As part of the operation of the SNRCC, in addition to the coordination group (GdC), several working groups have been formed made up of technical representatives of the institutions according to the various topics related to climate change. In the case of adaptation, there are two directly related groups, the Working Group on Adaptation to Climate Change (GdT.ACC) and the Working Group on adaptation in cities, an area that was initiated within the framework of the preparation of the PNA Cities and that after its presentation to the UNFCCC is in charge of reviewing, updating and defining the five-year work plans and promoting the adaptation actions of the PNA Cities. Likewise, there is a network working group with the municipalities of the coastal departments, Colonia, San José, Montevideo, Canelones, Maldonado and Rocha, to follow up on the actions that are being planned within the framework of the PNA Coasts.</p>
<p>Other Working Groups that have been formed, with more transversal themes but that contribute to the development of adaptation actions are: Losses and Damages; in climate services; in gender; in education, communication and awareness.</p>
<p>At the regional level, participation is accentuated in areas where the relevance of adaptation to climate change has been highlighted, such as the Meeting of Ministers of the Environment of MERCOSUR and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).</p>
<p>On the other hand, in addition to the possibility of advancing in regional climate change adaptation projects, both the EU Cooperation Program with Latin America and the Caribbean - EUROCLIMA, as well as the Ibero-American Network of Climate Change Offices (RIOCC ), constitute important spaces for the exchange of good practices at the regional level.</p>
<p>As specific initiatives at the regional level, the Binational Project (Uruguay - Argentina): Adaptation to Climate Change in Cities and Vulnerable Coastal Ecosystems of the Uruguay River is being implemented. Said project is financed by the Adaptation Fund and its program allows the implementation of pilot adaptation actions to reduce vulnerabilities to floods, and improve knowledge and management of river ecosystems. Likewise, Uruguay is part of the development, together with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay, of the Strategic Action Plan of the La Plata Basin (PAE) that promotes adaptation actions focused on the integrated management of water resources, risk management , sustainable land management, research and technological development, among others.</p>
<p>At the international level, Uruguay actively participates in climate change negotiations that take place mainly in the UNFCCC sphere. In this context, Uruguay considers compliance with the provisions on international cooperation established in the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement of special relevance.</p>
<p>Likewise, it highlights the importance of achieving the global adaptation objective established in the Paris Agreement, for which it is essential to advance solidly and strengthen international cooperation to address the challenges regarding methodological, empirical, conceptual and political visions for achieve said objective.</p>
<p>In this sense, Uruguay is committed to working to contribute to the global objective related to adaptation, as well as to the global balance in relation to adaptation, and as a concrete action the presentation of three national adaptation plans (PNA Agro , PNA Coasts, PNA Cities and Infrastructures) as well as two additional ones that are in the process of being prepared (PNA Health and PNA Energy), in addition to the first ComAd and this one.</p>
<p>7.9. Monitoring and Evaluation</p>
<p>The adaptation measures included in the first CRC have been monitored and the evaluation of the progress in its implementation has been informed in detail in the public viewer of its monitoring system17. Efforts have been made to show progress in the implementation of adaptation measures, generating management indicators based on the achievement of milestones or stages defined for each measure, which account for progress in a transparent manner, managing to express it quantitatively. </p>
<p>The evaluation of adaptation actions in terms of impact continues to be a challenge, both for the follow-up of ComAd1 and for the follow-up that is planned for this ComAd2. Added to this is the challenge of migrating towards a monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) framework that is becoming an international trend. However, it is considered that this metric, in addition to allowing monitoring of the management of adaptation actions, allows the assessment, adjustment and adaptation of methodological processes to improve the development of strategies and actions to reduce vulnerability, increase adaptive capacities, identify the risks, strengthen the resilience of socio-ecological systems and significantly reduce Losses and Damages.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the MEL framework to highlight is the opportunity for learning, the exchange of good practices and the potential for improvement in adaptation processes, considering: the influence of the particular context where adaptation actions are implemented; changing climate circumstances that require greater flexibility as an intrinsic principle in adaptation processes; uncertainty about the direct and collateral effects of adaptation actions and the need to generate co-benefits with local development and the social well-being of the population.</p>
<p>The monitoring and evaluation of the ComAd2 measures linked to the NAPs will be supported by the monitoring and evaluation plans defined within each of said plans. This will imply a parallel effort and a need for coordination and mutual support between the responsible teams.</p>
<p>Advances in the MEL of the adaptation of the ComAd will be informed in the Biennial Transparency Reports, in accordance with the guidelines established in the modalities, procedures and guidelines for the transparency framework for the measures and the support to be referenced in Article 13 of the Paris Agreement Guidelines (Decision 18/ CMA.1).</p>
<p>MEL's work will include the review, monitoring and updating of gender measures in each of the ComAd measures, continuing the efforts already made to achieve a gender-responsive monitoring system.</p>
<p>7.10. Means of Implementation</p>
<p>This National Adaptation Communication is considered necessary and a priority for Uruguay to face the challenge of climate change and advance on the path of sustainable development. Uruguay is a country that is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which should generate more opportunities for its inhabitants, combat poverty and indigence, and achieve a higher level of social equity while conserving its ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The implementation of this Communication will only be possible through access to means of implementation outside the country, mainly from non-reimbursable funds, but also through access to financing under preferential conditions, technology transfer, capacity building and direct foreign investment from developed countries. Uruguay understands that the availability of means of implementation provided by developed countries is a requirement for the implementation of climate action to occur within a framework of just transition and climate justice.</p>
<p>Uruguay has a track record of compliance and transparency in receiving external means of implementation for climate action. The implementation of this ComAd and the climate urgency require that said flow of implementation means to the country be accelerated considerably. In this sense, Uruguay is an ideal destination for the implementation of pilot actions that can later be replicated in other countries.</p>
<p>Beyond the adaptation efforts implemented and implemented in Uruguay, the impacts of climate change lead to losses and damages on Uruguayan society, their livelihoods, infrastructures and ecosystems, which is why Uruguay needs to access specifically designed funds to that end.</p>
<p>8. Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of the Second Nationally Determined Contribution</p>
<p>8.1. Scope and coverage</p>
<p>The mitigation objectives of the CDN2 of Uruguay cover emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O gases and the consumption of HFCs that occur in the national territory and that together represent 99.2% of CO2 emissions- eq of Uruguay in the INGEI 2019 (GWP100 AR5).</p>
<p>Regarding the provisions set out in the Paris Agreement, only the unconditional objectives of Section 5.1.1 will be bindingly subject to the procedures of the enhanced transparency framework for measures and support defined in Article 13 [ 1] and any provisions relating to the mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, of a non-punitive and non-adversarial nature, defined in Article 15 [1], and as decided by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>8.2. Main assumptions</p>
<p>The mitigation objectives of Uruguay's CDN2 were defined considering the current path of development of the country, without including structural transformations of its productive matrix by 2022 and considering the official projections of economic growth that cover the period 2022-2026 and assuming potential GDP growth between 2027 and 2030.</p>
<p>To define the CO2 target value for 2030 in Section 5.1.1.1, the following fleet of electric vehicles is assumed: 900 buses, 600 taxis, remises and digital applications, 5,000 utility vehicles and 20,000 light vehicles. The following process improvements at the ANCAP refinery are also assumed: replacement of fuel oil consumption by natural gas, increase in condensate recovery and advanced control in some processes and equipment. In turn, to define the target value conditional on specific additional means of implementation, a fleet of approximately 600 hydrogen trucks is assumed.</p>
<p>8.3. Methodology to estimate emissions and removals</p>
<p>Uruguay's CND2 mitigation targets were prepared using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. They will be monitored using this or another methodology in accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and approved by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>8.4. Implementation and reporting period</p>
<p>The implementation of the CDN2 can begin before the year 2026 and its effects will be reflected in the Biennial Transparency Reports presented between 2028 (INGEI 1990-2026) and 2034 (INGEI 1990-2032), since to calculate the values of the indicators in section 5.1.</a> It is necessary to have an estimate of the INGEI 2031.</p>
<p>8.5. Types of objectives and measures unconditional and conditional to specific additional means of implementation</p>
<p>The mitigation objectives of Uruguay's CDN2 to 2030 of unconditional scope, as well as the mitigation measures included in Section 5.3.1, may include the use of Foreign Direct Investment, of the Mechanism for Clean Development of the Protocol of Kyoto, of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement [1], as well as support for various means of implementation, including financing, technology transfer and capacity building.</p>
<p>The 2030 Uruguay CDN2 mitigation objectives of Conditional scope, as well as the mitigation measures included in Section 5.3.2, must be supported by specific additional means of implementation, this support being mainly, but not exclusively, non-reimbursable public and/or concessional external financing. In all cases, these supports will be defined by Uruguay and thus informed specifically on a case-by-case basis and in relation to the corresponding conditional objectives of Section 5.1.2 and/or the measures of Section 5.3.2</p>
<p>About the measures of Chapters 4 and 6:</p>
<p>The measures listed in Chapters 4 and 6 have been considered necessary and a priority by Uruguay to face the challenge of climate change from adaptation and capacity building and knowledge generation. However, the full implementation of these will require support from means of implementation, including financing, technology transfer and capacity building.</p>
<p>8.6. Definition of the target year and data sources to facilitate monitoring of the CDN2 mitigation objectives under Article 13 of the Paris Agreement and decisions 1/CP.21 and 4/CMA.1</p>
<p>Definition of the target year and identification of sources to verify the global objectives of GHG emissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The target year is 2030, from January 1 to December 31 of that year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O will be those reported in the INGEI 2030 considering those subcategories of emissions estimated in the INGEI 2019 (last INGEI available at the time of preparing the CDN2), without considering category 3.B Lands (category according to IPCC Guidelines 2006) nor subcategory 3.C.4., FSOM source, which depends directly on category 3.B. Land. This source represented in the 2019 INGEI less than 0.78% of national emissions (without considering category 3.B. Land). Category 3.B Lands presented net removals throughout the entire 1990 - 2019 series and for this category specific objectives of conservation and increase of carbon stocks regarding Land Use and Forestry are established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SF6 emissions are not included, since it represents less than 0.003% of national emissions (without considering category 3.B Land).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CO2 objective of Section 5.1.1.1 may be adjusted based on the hydraulic conditions of the year 2030 as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the event that hydroelectric generation in the year 2030 is greater than or equal to 6,070 GWh<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, the 2030 target value, in Gg of CO2, will be the value in Section 5.1.1.1 of this CDN;</p>

<li>
<p>Target value 2030 (in Gg CO2) = X + (Z – Y – 440)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>X = 2030 CO2 target value contained in Section 5.1.1.1 of this NDC, Gg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Z = CO2 emissions from the category “1.A.1.ai – Electricity generation” for the year 2030,</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HFC consumption reduction objective is defined in relation to a baseline that will be established from the average consumption of the years 2020 to 2022, as indicated in the text of the Kigali Amendment to the Protocol of Montreal approved in 2016; this value will be the one reported to the Ozone Secretariat when appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consumption (assimilated to import) of HFCs will be the one reported as activity data in the INGEI 2030.</p>
</li>

<p>Emissions estimates may be modified, affecting the results, due to improvements in estimation methodologies. When a change is made in the estimates for a certain year, the GHG emissions and removals must be reviewed and eventually recalculated for the entire series, including the base year, to obtain a coherent time series. In the latter case, the estimates of the values for the years 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1991 are calculated from the implicit emission factor for the year 1990 multiplied by the number of heads of the corresponding year.</p>

The knowledge and response capacity of operators and officials to possible impacts and risks derived from climate change is improved, which results in a multiplier effect due to traction in the behavior of visitors and tourists.</p>
