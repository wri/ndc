<h1>Update of the Nationally Determined Contribution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the fight against Climate Change and its effects</h1>
<p>November 2021</p>
<h3><a>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</a></h3>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, through the Ministry of Popular Power for Ecosocialism, as the National Environmental Authority, expresses its gratitude for all the support received for this process of Updating the "Nationally Determined Contribution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela"; highlighting the Institutional commitment of the different sectors involved from the Ministries and Organizations, which allowed the incorporation of new essential elements for the strengthening of climate action, which will lead our country to the implementation of actions framed towards sustainable development.</p>
<p>In this sense, Venezuela pursues with the Update of the CND, laying the foundations of the "Action for Climate Empowerment" in our country, as a transversal axis in integrating and inclusive public policies of an economic, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, political and institutional, among others, that allow generating and articulating capacities that promote transformative action in the face of climate change, with the depth and urgency that this challenge requires to reduce vulnerability in the population and of natural spaces.</p>
<p>In order to increase response capacities and create the foundations of contextualized resilience within the framework of education, research, training, social awareness, access to information, citizen participation, development and transfer of technology and innovations, in order to consolidate in this way the inclusion and participation policies, including those related to gender and intergenerational equity, which allow increasing the leading and determining role of women as dynamizers of the processes of struggle against climate change, as well as youth, boys and girls, and the elderly.</p>
<p>Likewise, with the presentation of the CND update, Venezuela seeks to contribute effectively to the fulfillment of the global goals of the Paris Agreement, which has among its objectives to keep the increase in the world average temperature below 2 °C , with respect to pre-industrial levels and continue with the efforts to limit this increase in temperature to 1.5 °C, under the criteria of common but differentiated responsibilities that make it possible to face the effects of Climate Change, for the preservation of generations present and future.</p>
<p>The document includes the technical considerations emanating from debates formulated by the team of the Ministry of Popular Power for Ecosocialism, nurtured with the work of experts in the field, as well as a diverse group of actors and institutions involved in the issue of climate change, in addition to the experiences of other countries that currently have their updated NDCs, and the guidelines derived from international forums in which the country participated.</p>
<p>Venezuela, through the General Directorate for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation of the Minister of People's Power for Ecosocialism, began the process of reviewing and updating its CND, with the support of the different sectors and institutions as well as the Substantive General Directorates, for the collective construction of the CND, to be presented within the framework of the celebration of COP 26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom from October 31 to November 12, 2021.</p>

<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Climate Change is one of the biggest problems currently affecting the planet, this situation transcends the environmental and must be considered in its ethical, human, socio-economic and political dimensions. It is, in fact, one of the clearest manifestations of the crisis of capitalism as a predatory system of nature that makes a healthy, full, supportive and peaceful life on earth impossible.</p>
<p>It also translates into a dimension of the global environmental crisis generated by unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, particularly in developed countries, which have a historical responsibility in its generation. Therefore, only the modification of these patterns constitutes a true and lasting solution to the environmental crisis and consequently to the climate crisis.</p>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, being a country characterized by presenting insular spaces and low altitude coasts, with arid and semi-arid zones exposed to floods, drought and desertification, and with fragile mountainous ecosystems; whose core economy is particularly dependent on the production, use and export of fossil fuels; It is considered, according to the categories established in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), as highly vulnerable; and particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of Climate Change and the secondary consequences of potential response measures.</p>
<p>This vulnerability has become evident in a series of emergencies and natural disasters with severe effects on housing, food production, hydroelectricity generation, and biological diversity, among others such as those that occurred during the months of August and September 2021 in the states of Mérida, Táchira and Anzoátegui.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has taken large-scale measures with significant investments, which have made it possible to care for and protect the affected population to reduce damage and reduce vulnerability.</p>
<p>In the framework of what was agreed upon under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement (PA), Venezuela presents the update of the Nationally Determined Contribution (CND), committed to building a productive economic model ecosocialist. These actions are articulated within the framework of the Economic and Social Development Plan of the Nation Law of the Homeland Plan 2019 - 2025, where the deepening of ecosocialist policies with a high social, economic and environmental impact is proposed to contribute to the fight against Climate Change.</p>
<p>In the same way, said CND allows us to reaffirm the commitment that the country has in climate matters, in the different multilateral spaces of the United Nations system, as well as in the regional and inter-regional coordination mechanisms such as: The</ p>
<p>Ibero-American Conference of Ministers of the Environment, the Forum of Ministers of the Environment of the United Nations Program for the Environment, Meeting of Ministers and High Authorities of the Environment of the Bolivarian Alliance for the peoples of Our America - Peoples' Trade Treaty (ALBA - TCP), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), among others.</p>
<p>For this update process, the transparency guidelines emanating from the following Decisions 4/CMA.1, 1/CP.21 and 9/CMA.1 have been taken into account. Likewise, the recommendations of the instances and support organizations regarding elements considered essential to increase the level of ambition and the robustness of the information have been incorporated.</p>
<p>In this update and presentation of the CND, elements related to gender and equity are incorporated, which allow progress in the national objectives of the fight against poverty and inequality, within the framework of national planning for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the 2030 Agenda. Likewise, the imposition of Unilateral Coercive Measures (MCU) that violate the human rights of the Venezuelan population, and the special situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic are incorporated into the elements. 19, which has required a rethinking and rearrangement of planning and State administration to face the critical situation and the post-2020 recovery scenario.</p>
<p>In this sense, Venezuela presents its contributions in adaptation and mitigation, encompassing actions and policies towards fair and sustainable development. These contributions have been advanced voluntarily and without international financing. They had not been updated, until now, due to the illegal application of the Unilateral Coercive Measures (MCU) that violate the human rights of the population and the health circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Said update is framed in the Economic and Social Development Plan of the Nation, which establishes the priority of the fight against Climate Change within the framework of an integral, humanist and eco-socialist development oriented to Good Living in harmony with Mother Earth. </p>
<p>For each commitment, a brief description of the context is included with reference to the circumstances of the corresponding sector or strategic area, followed by a summary table that includes the commitment to its goal, the governing entity, the type of commitment, preliminary indicators and the SDGs to which they contribute. The description of each commitment is complemented by a brief indicative reference regarding the operational aspects related to the means of implementation, its potential for integration, adaptation - mitigation and culminating with a statement of long-term ambition.</p>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of the decisions under the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela presents here the update of its Nationally Determined Contribution (CND) for the fight against Climate Change and its effects.</p>
<p>This update of the Contribution must be examined in light of the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities, which implies, among other elements, that in order to materialize the commitments expressed by developing countries, the financial resources provided for are required to support actions in developing countries, as well as technology transfer and capacity building, which developed countries must increasingly contribute, in accordance with their obligations established in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ) and the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Finally, this update of the CND is part of a national process of collective construction of a proposed Law on Climate Change for the country, which involves different actors and sectors, organized communities and social movements, and which aspires to adopt in the legislative period from 2021 to 2026.</p>
<h3>2. BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>As part of the obligations assumed before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela accepted the commitment to inform everything relevant to the contents, which by mandate of the Convention is established to the preparation of National Communications on Climate Change. Venezuela's political commitment is of a high level in the fight against Climate Change, as expressed by President Nicolás Maduro Moros, during the intervention at the 75th General Assembly of the United Nations Organization, held in October 2020. , namely:</p>
<p>We must all work for the salvation of our Planet. We call for the highest political commitment to combat climate change, which is a reality: to combat climate change as an urgent priority. We recognize the importance of strengthening mitigation and adaptation actions, in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. We reaffirm, then, the importance of the means of implementation so that developing countries can carry out their climate actions. Noam Chomsky warned him recently: “there is not much time left”.</p>
<p><a>Reiterating in this way the great political commitment at the highest level in the fight against climate change.</a></p>
<h3>2.1. THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC)</h3>
<p>This instrument was approved in 1992 and ratified by Venezuela in 1994, through the Official Gazette of the Republic of Venezuela No. 4,825 Extraordinary of December 27, 1994.</p>
<h3>2.2. THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h3>
<p>Approved and published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No.</p>
<p>38,081 of December 7, 2004. This protocol establishes commitments and goals on emission reductions for Annex I countries, and voluntary reductions for Non-Annex I countries. In it, the Ministry with environmental competence, presented an Account Point to the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in which the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol in our country is limited, specifically the sections related to the flexibility mechanisms provided for in this Protocol, called Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) . This presidential decision not to resort to the Clean Development Mechanisms will later be reflected in the National Government Plans, First and Second Plan of the Homeland.</p>
<h3>2.3. THE DOHA AMENDMENT TO THE KYOTO PROTOCOL</h3>
<p>This amendment was approved at COP-18 in Qatar in 2012, and ratified by Venezuela in 2017, which establishes the subsequent commitment period for Annex I countries after 2012, and is increased to eight years the second period (2012 - 2020).</p>
<h3>2.4. THE RATIFICATION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
<p>At COP-21 of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Venezuela adopts the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on December 12, 2015.</p>
<p>In April 2016, Venezuela signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change at the United Nations (UN) in the commemorative act of Earth Day, on April 22.</p>
<p>On July 21, 2017, Venezuela completes the steps required for the ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, with the deposit of the instrument of ratification before the depositary at the UN.</p>
<p>At that time, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela becomes a State Party to the 154th Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in July 2017. The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela empowers the Executive to adopt international agreements, Article 236 on the Attributions of</p>
<p>President of the Republic: “4. Direct the foreign relations of the Republic and celebrate and ratify international treaties, conventions or agreements.”</p>
<h3>2.5. THE LEGAL CONTEXT OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
<p>The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a legal instrument for the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), therefore the principles and provisions of the Convention prevail and guide the implementation of said agreement. </p>
<p>The previous work of elaboration and discussion of the Contribution planned and determined at the National level of Venezuela was advanced, by the then Ministry of Popular Power for Ecosocialism and Water (MINEA), in the previous years 2013 and 2014, today the Ministry of Popular Power for Ecosocialism (MINEC), compiling the contributions obtained through inter-ministerial consultations. Its delivery was formalized in the plenary for the adoption of the Paris Agreement at the XXI Conference of the Parties (COP-21), in December 2015.</p>
<p>In this order of ideas, Venezuela formalized its Nationally Determined Contribution (CND) before the Executive Secretariat of the CMUNCC, based in Bonn, Germany, and later formally delivered it in February 2018, before the Executive Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
<h3>3. DESCRIPTION OF THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE CND - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CONVENTION AND THE PARIS AGREEMENT</h3>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has a high political commitment, within the framework of the Paris Agreement, adopted through decision 1/CP.21, which addresses crucial areas necessary to combat climate change.</p>
<p>Therefore, the general objective of the NDCs for Venezuela is to implement policies, actions and efforts that promote the reduction of greenhouse gases and the increase in resilience and decrease in vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change in the prioritized sectors. These actions and efforts will be directed through the strategic lines and measures identified in the subsequent sections of the document.</p>
<p><strong>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ratifies its commitment to reduce its GHG emissions by 20% by the year 2030 in relation to the inertial scenario. To this end, the country contemplates activities in various sectors, including adaptation and mitigation actions, with adaptation being the national priority. The degree to which this goal is achieved will depend on the fulfillment of the commitments of the developed countries regarding the provision of financing, technology transfer and capacity building in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.7 of the Convention.</strong></p>
<p>In this sense, the country bases compliance with its CND, as a priority for the fight against poverty and its right to development, under the principles contemplated in the UNFCCC and other current and relevant international instruments, including the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.</p>
<p>Ambitious implementation of NDCs is essential to ensure that near-future global emissions peaks and climate risks are reduced, so that development co-benefits can be simultaneously achieved. The Paris Agreement calls for each country to outline and communicate its post-2020 climate actions; and thus implement their determined contributions at the national level. Here are some of these key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-term temperature objective</strong> (article 2) The Paris Agreement, in seeking to strengthen the global response to climate change, reaffirms the objective of limiting the increase in global temperature very below 2°C, while efforts continue to limit it to 1.5°C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peak and climate neutrality</strong> (Article 4) In order to achieve this temperature target, the Parties aim to reach the peak of global GHG emissions as soon as possible, and to recognize that that point maximum will take more time for developing country Parties to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHGs in the second half of the century.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong> (Article 4) The Paris Agreement establishes binding commitments by all Parties to prepare, communicate and maintain a CND and apply national measures to achieve them. It also establishes that the Parties will communicate their nationally determined contributions every five years, and will provide the necessary information for clarity and transparency. To set a firm foundation for higher ambition, each successive Nationally Determined Contribution will represent a progression beyond the previous one, and will reflect the highest possible ambition. Developed countries should continue to take the lead by setting absolute economy-wide reduction targets, while developing countries should continue to intensify their mitigation efforts, while being encouraged to move towards achieving the economy-wide targets. economy over time, in light of different national circumstances.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sinks and reservoirs</strong> (Article 5) -The Paris Agreement also encourages Parties to conserve and enhance, as appropriate, the GHG sinks and reservoirs referred to in paragraph d ) of Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, including forests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voluntary Participation / Market and Non-Market Approaches </strong> (Article 6) The Paris Agreement recognizes the possibility of voluntary participation between Parties to enable greater ambition and establishes principles - including integrity transparency, and sound accounting - for any cooperation that involves the international transfer of mitigation results. It establishes a mechanism to contribute to the mitigation of GHG emissions and support sustainable development, and defines a framework for non-market approaches to sustainable development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptation</strong> (article 7). The Paris Agreement sets a global goal on adaptation, namely increasing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change in the context of the Agreement's temperature target. Its goal is to significantly strengthen national adaptation efforts, including through international support and cooperation. The Agreement recognizes that adaptation is a global challenge facing everyone. All Parties should engage in adaptation, including through the development and implementation of national adaptation plans, and should submit and regularly update an adaptation communication outlining their priorities, needs, plans and actions. The adaptation efforts of developing countries should be recognized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loss and damage</strong> (Article 8) The Paris Agreement recognizes the importance of avoiding, minimizing and addressing loss and damage related to the adverse effects of climate change , including extreme weather events and slow onset events, and the contribution of sustainable development to reducing the risk of loss and damage. Parties should strengthen understanding, action and support, including through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, in a cooperative and facilitative manner with respect to loss and damage related to the adverse effects of climate change. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial, technological and capacity-building resources</strong> (Articles 9, 10 and 11) The Paris Agreement reaffirms the obligations of developed countries to support the efforts of the Parties that are developing countries to build a clean and climate-resilient future, while for the first time encouraging other Parties to provide or continue to provide such support on a voluntary basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Resource provision should also aim to strike a balance between adaptation and mitigation. In addition to reporting on funding already provided, developed country Parties undertake to provide information</p>
<p>transparent and indicative information on future support for developing country parties, including expected levels of public funding.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement also provides for the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, including the Green Climate Fund, which will serve the Agreement. International cooperation in the development and transfer of climate technology is also strengthened, as well as the strengthening of institutional capacities in the Parties of the developing world through the necessary ad hoc institutional agreements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Education, training, public awareness and participation and public access to information on climate change</strong> (Article 12). They should also be strengthened under the Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency (article 14), implementation and compliance</strong> (article 15). The Paris Agreement is based on a robust system of transparency and accountability to provide clarity on actions and support by Parties, with flexibility for the different capacities of Parties. In addition to submitting information on mitigation, adaptation and support, the Agreement requires that the information submitted by each Party be subject to an international review by technical experts. The Agreement also includes a mechanism that will facilitate enforcement and promote compliance in a non-adversarial and non-punitive manner, and will report annually to the CP/RA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>World balance</strong> (article 14). A "global stocktake", which will take place in 2023 and every five years thereafter, will assess collective progress towards achieving the Agreement's goals in a comprehensive and facilitative way. It will be based on the best available science and its long-term global goal. Its result will serve as a basis for the Parties to update and improve their measures and support and increase international cooperation in the fight against climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK</h3>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms its commitment to the construction of an alternative model of development, a geopolitics of respect for peoples, for identity; a coexistence policy; a policy of peace with justice, with equality; a policy that rejects any attempt to impose the will of one country on another; either through threats and the use of force, or through financial, economic, cultural and political means.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic, approved in a popular referendum in 1999, consecrates Environmental Rights and is a pioneer in establishing that:</p>
<p>It is a right and a duty of each generation to protect and maintain the environment for the benefit of itself and the future world. Every person has the right individually and collectively to enjoy a safe, healthy and ecologically balanced life and environment. The State will protect the environment, biological diversity, genetic resources, ecological processes, national parks and natural monuments, and other areas of special ecological importance. The genome of living beings may not be patented, and the law that refers to bioethical principles will regulate the matter. It is a fundamental obligation of the State, with the active participation of society, to guarantee that the population develops in an environment free of contamination, where the air, water, soil, coasts, climate, ozone layer, living species, are specially protected in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Developing constitutional principles, Venezuela has reviewed, updated, and strengthened its legal framework, promoting equitable, just, and effective socio-environmental management.</p>
<h3>4.1. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT</h3>
<p>The purpose of the CNDs is to comply with the provisions established in the Paris Agreement, as well as to promote adaptation and mitigation in our country in the face of the challenge of climate change. To better focus efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit by 2020 long-term development strategies with low greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>In this sense, on January 16, 2019, the Ministry of People's Power for Ecosocialism (MINEC), as the National Environmental Authority, created in its organizational structure the "General Directorate for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation" whose The objective is to promote participation, awareness, systematization and consolidation of actions for conservation and protection against the effects of Climate Change, through the design and implementation of policies and guidelines applied at the national level, in terms of adaptation, mitigation and associated losses and damages. </p>
<p>This General Directorate is the Technical Focal Point before the UNFCCC, and also seeks to strengthen Ecosocialism as an axiological value of environmental management in the fight against Climate Change, deepening the sustainable political, economic and social model, assumed collectively and responsibly with nature.</p>
<p>To implement these tasks, the General Directorate was structured into four Line Directorates: Climate Change Adaptation Directorate; Climate Change Mitigation Department; Directorate of Policy Formulation, Monitoring and Control of Climate Change; and the Directorate of Losses and Damages due to Climate Change.</p>
<p>The creation of this institutionality allows laying the foundations for permanent inter-institutional coordination with other sectors on Climate Change matters. Likewise, it seeks the coordination of actions with the bodies and entities in charge of territorial planning and disaster management.</p>
<p>The MINEC, through the "General Directorate for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation", will be in charge of consolidating national information on Climate Change and coordinating the preparation of national reports in the context of the UNFCCC and its related instruments </p>
<h3><a>5. ON THE GOVERNANCE OF CLIMATE FINANCE</a></h3>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has adopted institutional arrangements for access to climate financing, through the appointment of the "Ministry of Popular Power for Ecosocialism as the National Authority designated before the Green Climate Fund"<strong>,</strong > with the powers inherent to the aforementioned position of Minister, according to Decree No. 4,585 dated September 21, 2021, published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No. 42,217 of the same date.</p>
<p>By Presidential Decree the "Presidential Commission called the National Committee of the Green Climate Fund" is created, according to Decree No. 4,586 dated September 21, 2021, published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No. 42,217 on the same date, as a permanent advisory body to the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which will have the following functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Collective prioritization of projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, for his approval, the investment plans and projects that will be executed within the framework of the Green Climate Fund.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a>These arrangements determine the coordination relationships between the different instances of the National Executive. This Presidential Commission will be in charge of leading, coordinating and approving the strategies and public policies necessary to prevent and respond to the impacts of climate change, as well as enforcing the appropriate legal and institutional framework for such purposes.</a></p>
<h3>6. UNILATERAL COERCIVE MEASURES</h3>
<p>The environmental sector from the perspective of Ecosocialism, as an axiological value of environmental management assumed by the Venezuelan State, does not escape the effects</p>
<p>negatives generated by the imposition of Unilateral Coercive Measures (MCU), and other restrictive or punitive measures against our country; in an international context that requires the execution and follow-up of agreed agreements to deal with Climate Change and the responsible management of environmental problems capable of degrading the environment of urban and rural systems.</p>
<p>The MCU, translated into economic sanctions, embargoes, blockades and restrictions have a negative impact on the enjoyment and full enjoyment of the Fundamental Human Rights of citizens, including: the right to life, food, to health and medical care, education, work, clothing, housing, public services and the full exercise of human dignity.</p>
<p>On September 26, 2014, the Human Rights Council approved Resolution 27/21 and Corr.1, on human rights and MCU, which emphasizes that such measures are contrary to international law, humanitarian law international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations between States, and insists that, in the long term, such measures can cause social problems and pose humanitarian difficulties in the States to which those that apply.</p>
<p>There is currently an international consensus on the negative effects on human rights in the civilian population of the country, subject to said sanctions and their incidence in the poverty of broad sectors of the population, especially affecting vulnerable groups such as: women, girls and boys, peasants, the elderly and the disabled, among others.</p>
<p>In the context of the evaluation of the main impacts of the MCUs in the competences of the MINEC, a descriptive analysis has been included in this report in the following areas: international environmental policy, comprehensive waste management, waste management, hospital medical waste, inspection and control of environmental impacts of activities likely to degrade the environment, climate change, the commitments of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and Recreational Parks as a public service.</p>
<p>In the international arena, even when our country participates in at least 74 multilateral environmental spaces, to which this institution constantly reports the progress of the commitments acquired, the MCUs have restricted the participation of Venezuela in some of the meetings, where the host governments have not responded to the visa request of the officials who should attend. This situation constitutes a clear violation of the norms of Public International Law.</p>
<p>Regarding the mobilization of resources, to facilitate the effective implementation of environmental policies, the MCUs have prevented the institution from accessing multilateral banks, such as the IDB; to the Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund; as well as reduce the possibility of receiving financing to strengthen SOUTH-SOUTH cooperation, and the programs and projects that this institution came from</p>
<p>executing with the countries of the region. This is how the MCUs influence the implementation of the CNDs, which once again diminishes the action of the Paris Agreement, by affecting the sectors involved in said CNDs.</p>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, like a large part of the countries in the region, is subject to vulnerabilities to climate change, which is why, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, it is responsible for complying with actions that contribute to the fight against Climate Change.</p>
<p>In this sense, it is worth mentioning that the MCUs go against the provisions of the Paris Agreement, since they reduce the capacity and effectiveness of the actions necessary to adapt to the adverse effects of Climate Change, also having a negative impact in Post COVID-19 sustainable recovery plans, as well as actions in the event of eventual climate-related disasters in the region.</p>
<p>In summary, the following elements must be considered to enable compliance with the CND:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multilateralism must respect International Law, including human rights, environmental Law and the right to sustainable development of nations, including the right to self-determination, and not interfere in the multilateral rules of international trade.</p >
</li>
<li>
<p>MCUs ignore not only legal norms, but are also in flagrant violation of ethical principles and can be seen as a crime against humanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MCUs are discretionary actions contrary to International Law, to subdue those who transgressed the hegemonic ideological imperatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MCUs place the population in a fragile situation, the infrastructure and institutions are affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a direct impact of MCUs on people's basic rights such as water or a healthy environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a deep link, although with an indirect impact, between Climate Change and MCUs, because they affect a country's ability to respond to the Climate Change crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MCUs have a tremendous impact on climate action: adaptation, mitigation, acquisition of technologies and promotion of technological adaptation for efficient transformations in sectors such as: energy, transportation, water supply, healthy environment, among others. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the application of the MCU is particularly immoral in the midst of the crisis we are experiencing from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financing and provision of means of implementation for Climate Change is one of the crucial issues for implementation, and MCUs imply the exclusion or discrimination of some countries from the international financial system, even for accreditation options.</ p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Climate action demands not only leadership, but also solidarity and coherence in actions related to “climate justice” in the Climate Change discussion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. SITUATION - COVID 19</h3>
<p>In addition to the national situation generated by the illegal application of the MCU, the effects produced by the health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic are added, which demand the immediate adoption of measures for the protection of the Venezuelan people. As has been recognized by ECLAC (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean), the pandemic made visible the structural problems of the economic model system, and the shortcomings of the social protection system in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Regarding the estimates of the impact of the health crisis in the years 2020 and 2021, ECLAC has indicated that for the Latin American and Caribbean region it represents a setback of a decade in the fight against poverty reduction, which implies that this will affect the plans already planned by the countries on climate change, leading to the necessary prioritization of measures aimed at adaptation and loss and damage.</p>
<p>The pandemic crisis, together with the illegal MCUs, are a call to reflect on the importance of human health and its interrelationship with the health of the planet.</p>
<h3>8. POLITICAL VISION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY</h3>
<h3>8.1. PLAN OF THE COUNTRY 2019 - 2025.</h3>
<h3>The Homeland Plan: "Third Socialist Plan for Economic and Social Development of the Nation of Venezuela" is a medium-term plan for the period 2019 - 2025, which contains general guidelines for its implementation.</h3>
<p>This instrument provides for 5 Historical Objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Defend, expand and consolidate the most precious asset that we have reconquered after 200 years: National Independence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue building the Bolivarian socialism of the 21st century, in Venezuela, as an alternative to the destructive and savage system of capitalism and thereby ensure the "greatest amount of social security, the greatest amount of political stability and the greatest amount of happiness" for our town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert Venezuela into a powerful country in the social, economic and political spheres within the Great Rising Power of Latin America and the Caribbean, which guarantees the formation of a zone of peace in Our America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute to the development of a new International Geopolitics in which a multicentric and pluripolar world takes shape that allows achieving the balance of the Universe and guaranteeing planetary Peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute to the preservation of life on the planet and the salvation of the human species.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following are indicated as important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Material bases for the humanly rewarding transition towards socialism, transformation of the oil rentier culture into an inclusive, efficient and fair productive economic model, freeing the productive forces, in order to satisfy the needs of our population by promoting new management methods socialist and a productive fabric that breaks the metabolism of capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New economic and financial scaffolding of society: Breaking the moorings of the colonial, expoliative commercial model, focusing on the development of the support structure of the productive model. International commercial and financial mechanisms are particularly addressed, to strengthen the sovereign functioning of the national economy, stimulating new geopolitical mechanisms, cryptocurrencies and alternative financial architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National strategic resources, guaranteeing the preservation of hydrocarbon, mining and aquifer resources as heritage of present and future generations, as well as the role of Venezuela as a world energy power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social protection of the People, justice, the conception of services as necessities and not merchandise, guaranteeing their efficiency and sustainability, as well as the expansion, in the dialectical satisfaction of needs, of the system of missions and great missions. The constitutional programmatic development of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental rights is assumed as human rights of the population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decolonization as a fundamental component of the historical rupture, founded on the bases of indigenous, feminist, Afro-descendant, our American and deeply rooted Bolivarian national roots or the revolutionary transformation of the State, for the definitive irruption of the popular, participatory and communal State, guaranteeing popular control and the transfer of powers to combat inefficiency, bureaucracy and corruption, from the full participation of the organized people in planning, action, monitoring, control and joint management of the people-Government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demographic dividend and the historical potential of youth as a transversal strategy, with sectoral and spatial direction in the new national productive matrix and especially, through the development of knowledge and technology in the process of import substitution and promotion of the country's prioritized productive economic engines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National territorial system and the system of development plans for its decolonization and direction with full national development. The development of the spatial dimension of socialism from systemic, geohistorical and functional regionalization, the urban-regional system and the development of infrastructure, services and mobility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The socialist city, breaking the capitalist schemes of social and economic inequality of space, reorganizing with justice criteria the dynamics of land rent, economic specialization of the city and its urban sectors, equipment, infrastructure and public space , as well as an integrated system of land use and transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The graft of the productive system and the economy of maintenance. The Plan for the Homeland develops specific policies for the rupture of the metabolism of capital and the promotion of a new system of actors and economic dynamics to meet the social demands of the system of missions and great missions and the social protection of the People. As well as the specific policies aimed at the economy of maintenance, from the maxim of doing more with less and better as an economic and cultural doctrine of the Venezuelan State and society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ecosocialism as a revolutionary doctrine and historical social model based on respect for the rights of Mother Earth and the right to live well for our people, developing the principle of unity within diversity, an integral and systemic vision, participation popular, the role of the Nation State, the incorporation of technologies and forms of organization of production, distribution and consumption, which aim at the rational, optimal and sustainable use of natural resources, respecting the processes and cycles of nature.</p >
</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. INTEGRATION OF THE OVERVIEW OF THE 2030 AGENDA - SDG - LONG-TERM STRATEGY</h3>
<p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, includes 17 Goals and 169 targets, presents an ambitious vision of sustainable development and integrates its economic, social and environmental dimensions, being the expression of the wishes, aspirations and priorities of the international community for the next 15 years.</p>
<p>This is a transforming agenda, which places equality and dignity of people at the center and calls for a change in our style of development, while respecting the environment. It is a universal commitment made by both developed and developing countries, within the framework of a strengthened global alliance, which takes into account the means of implementation to carry out the change and the prevention of disasters due to extreme natural events, as well as the mitigation and adaptation to Climate Change.</p>
<p>In this sense, the voluntary national presentation goes beyond the fulfillment of a formality before a multilateral organism, which constitutes for Venezuela an expression of political will regarding the elevation of the standard of living of the people, and guarantees in its fundamental objective the historical construction of Socialism, guided by the premise of achieving the Greatest Sum of Happiness Possible.</p>
<p>Venezuela observes that the construction of Socialism in which it finds itself is perfectly compatible with the progress of the SDGs, in fact it is an opportunity for its practical implementation and momentum, while it aspires to give greater depth and coherence to joint work with international cooperation to finance and strengthen the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs, in accordance with national plans, and contributing to the sustainability and strengthening of the 15 Productive Economic Engines that were established for the economic boost of the country. For this, cooperation is required in the development of capacities to guarantee the comprehensiveness and intersectorality of public policies and their indicators.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SDGs aim to stimulate sustainable economic growth through increased levels of productivity and technological innovation. Developing these aspects is not an easy task, however, the country is committed to the development of policies that stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit of its citizens and communities, as well as the creation of jobs for the development of its population and promoting full employment. and productive.</p>
<p>The Homeland Plan is in line with the SDGs, so it is assumed to expand the time horizon of the Plan and the National Human Rights Plan until 2030 through its link with the Sustainable Development Agenda 2015 - 2030 </p>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela considers as Good Practices, four interrelated motors that were established as keys to progress:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The political commitment at the highest level for the adaptation of the bodies and entities of the Public Administration in their operational plans for the implementation of the SDGs and accountability for it under the supervision of the Council of Ministers of the six Sectoral Vice Presidencies for monitor the implementation of the SDGs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The launch of a process to enrich the general framework of public policies established in the National Development Plan 2013 - 2019 based on the content of the 2030 Agenda;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The instruction intended is the National Institute of Statistics (INE) to disaggregate the respective data and make visible the information on the most vulnerable sectors: children and adolescents, Afro-descendants, indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, the elderly and women, among others, under the principle of "Leave no one behind" and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The active incorporation of political, protagonist and co-responsible participation through consultation with social movements, non-state actors, productive sectors, academics and the People's Government Councils as a basis for the appropriation of the 2030 Agenda "from below, towards up.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This political commitment, assumed at the highest level, is visible in the political instruction of President Nicolás Maduro Moros for the collective appropriation of the SDGs, announced in the Council of Ministers on September 29, 2015, which has been followed by the institutional and legal arrangements: People - State - People, aimed at the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, together with the National Development Plan: Plan de la Patria 2013 - 2019.</p>
<p>These priorities are based on the development policy guidelines of the Venezuelan State established constitutionally, on our national vision of sustainable development with special emphasis on the social dimension, with public policies with a focus on human rights and on the lessons learned in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). The approach to these priorities is carried out from a comprehensive perspective, the Ecosocialist dimension of the national model expresses the political will for the simultaneous promotion of the social, environmental and economic dimensions on which the 2030 Agenda is based.</p>
<p><a>In summary, the Venezuelan State has repeatedly expressed its commitment to sustain the levels of social investment made in recent history as a mechanism to protect the people and advance in the achievement of Supreme Social Happiness, the highest goal of the construction of Bolivarian Socialism perfectly aligned with the SDGs.</a></p>
<p>10. GUIDELINE 1. MITIGATION</p>
<p>The specific objective of the CND in terms of mitigation is to contribute to global efforts to reduce GHG by identifying sectors, measures and lines of action that contribute to the mitigation of Climate Change in the country. Through these actions, it is intended to implement literal a) of article 2 of the Paris Agreement, which stipulates as one of the objectives of the Agreement: "Maintain the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 ºC with respect to the pre-industrial levels, and continue efforts to limit this temperature increase to 1.5ºC, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.”</p>
<p>Venezuela's emissions (0.24 Ggton CO2eq/year) only represent 0.49% of global GHG emissions. However, as part of the policies established in the country's economic and social development plan, which proposes to implement a National Mitigation Plan in conjunction with a National Adaptation Plan.</p>
<p>It is clear, however, that the actions and policies of a single country are not enough. Only if the countries that have historical responsibilities fully assume these responsibilities through ambitious mitigation targets (between 50 and 70% reduction of current emissions according to the IPCC in its 5th. report, estimated that it will probably increase as knowledge improves). ) and the reliable, sufficient and predictable provision of means of implementation (financing, technology transfer and capacity building) to developing countries; we can aspire to a real, just and lasting solution to the problem of Climate Change.</p>
<p>This involves the establishment of global goals for all means of implementation, monitoring, reporting and verification systems for their compliance by developed countries.</p>
<p>The means of financing must come from public funds and be administered under the Convention according to the priorities and needs established nationally by each country. Technology transfer must be oriented towards the "development and improvement of the endogenous capacities and technologies of the Parties that are developing countries" (Art. 4.5, UNFCCC) considering mechanisms for the flexibility of intellectual property rights that make this possible. </p>
<p>The Paris agreement must guarantee the implementation of the Convention under its principles and provisions; as well as promoting ways to settle the climate debt of developed countries.</p>
<h3>10.1. ACTIONS AND PROGRAMS WITH IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ITS EFFECTS</h3>
<p>Venezuela has developed a series of programs within which it has undertaken important actions, contributing to the fight against Climate Change and its effects from a perspective of justice and social inclusion. These programs could be deepened and multiplied by fulfilling commitments to provide means of implementation by developed countries under the UNFCCC.</p>
<h3>10.2. PROPOSALS BY SECTORS</h3>
<p>The proposals by sectors related to Actions and Programs with an Impact on Climate Change Mitigation and their effects in the case of Venezuela have been categorized into five large sectors, indicated below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Energy Sector.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Electric Power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil: Petróleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation Sector (Terrestrial and Underground, Water and Air).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industry Sector.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>General Directorate of Environmental Quality Management (FONDOIN).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forest Sector (General Directorate of Forest Heritage - Misión Árbol Foundation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waste Sector.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The update of the CND for 2021 was carried out based on the review of the previous CND, as well as the sectoral structural policies considering the evaluation, fulfillment of goals and projection to 2030.</p>
<p>Taking into account the Katowice Rules (Decision 4/CMA.1), for the review and updating of the CNDs, each government entity reformulated and/or updated the policies, programs and lines of action within their Sectoral Plans, that contribute to mitigate or reduce GHG emissions.</p>
<p>In this sense, the most relevant considerations that were taken into account when reviewing and updating the CNDs are mentioned below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Base year; start of implementation of climate action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application deadlines; it will be estimated at 5 or 10 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Range and coverage; identifying if the action is local, regional or national.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planning processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methodological approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimate of anthropogenic absorption; where the contribution of negative GHG emissions will be projected when applying climate action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considered reasons for your contribution to be fair and ambitious.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the CND formulation process, the mitigation component addressed the five prioritized sectors, namely:</p>
<h3>10.2.1. Energy Sector</h3>
<h3><a>Electric Power</a></h3>
<p>The analysis of the effects of Climate Change on planet Earth, from a critical and complex vision, shows that one of the causes that originates said event is the exacerbated emanation of carbon dioxide, product of the combustion of fossil fuels, required for the maintenance of the prevailing economic model of capitalism. Within the framework of this socioeconomic model and the logic imposed by the great powers, who are directly and indirectly responsible for the degradation and ecological and environmental imbalance of the planet.</p>
<p>Climate variation is a natural phenomenon in terrestrial dynamics; However, the problem facing humanity is the accelerated variation of the climate, as a consequence of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In this sense, Latin America and specifically Venezuela does not escape this reality, which causes severe droughts, which produce an alarming reduction in the levels of our rivers and reservoirs, on which 70% of the National Electric System depends, as well as the deforestation in the hydrographic basins that supply these reservoirs.</p>
<p>The structural response to the problem raised focuses on changing the prevailing global social economic model for an emerging one, which is supported by sustainable development and humanist social values for social transformation. In correspondence with the Plan de la Patria 2019 - 2025, within the framework of the transversal axes assumed by the Bolivarian Government of President Nicolás Maduro Moros, it proposes ecosocialism as the way to "Strengthen the National electricity sector".</p>
<p>Electric power generation is 79.73% from hydroelectric power plants, the remaining 20%, in thermoelectric power plants, as well as a use of wind power and small renewable energy generation systems using solar, wind power and micro hydroelectric power plants , in isolated, indigenous and border communities. Thermoelectric generation is carried out with fossil fuels, being 96.13% with Natural Gas, 3.65% with Diesel and 0.21% with Full Oil. The Venezuelan state guarantees the supply of electricity through the National Electricity Corporation (CORPOELEC), an entity attached to the Ministry of Popular Power for Electricity. The National Electric System interconnects the 131 hydroelectric, thermoelectric and wind generation plants, with the 885 substations and transmission and distribution systems. The Maximum Demand in 2021 is 12,839MW.</p>
<p>That is why this document presents a series of actions derived from the National Program for Energy Education and Energy Efficiency (PNEDUCEEE), which was designed considering the fundamental references of government policy regarding rational and efficient use of energy, as a transversal axis for the development of the country, such as: the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the horizons set out in the Plan de la Patria 2019 - 2025, the Organic Law of the Electric System and Service, Law of Rational and Efficient Use of Energy and Regulations related to the matter, Organic Regulation of the Ministry of Popular Power for Electric Energy, as well as the Guidelines of the Minister and the Office of the Vice-Ministry for New Sources and Rational and Efficient Use of Electric Energy. </p>
<p>The PNEDUCEEE, as the Structuring Program of the Plan de la Patria 2019 - 2025, reflects the steps for the implementation of the Structuring Policies: "Intensify the Rational and Efficient Use of Electric Power and the progressive inclusion of communities", and Promote a Change in the Matrix of Electricity Generation Sources, which favors the use of renewable energies.</p>
<p>The PNEDUCEEE is inspired by the precepts of the Homeland Plan 2019 - 2025:</p>
<p>This plan is to make a qualitative leap in the construction of a new historical time, in the transition to socialism... using as a guideline the navigation chart built with the pioneer Constitution, which opened the paths and was established as the road map on structural issues, for the definitive transformation of society.</p>
<p>This Plan is absolutely consistent with our historical line, from the Blue Book of Commander Chávez. It is a deepening of the Plan de la Patria 2012 - 2013 to 2018. Its architecture, its historical objectives are the same, marked by radicalization in the construction of Chavista and revolutionary thought, from historical directionality to socialism.”</p>
<p>In the case of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Rational and Efficient Use of Electric Energy is considered a matter of public interest, with the MPPEE being responsible for implementing policies to advance towards energy efficiency. The Vice Ministry for New Sources and Rational Use of Electric Energy, through the General Directorate of Rational and Efficient Use of Energy and the General Directorate of Alternative Energies, are responsible for promoting, through this Program and the National Program of Alternative Energies (PNEA), the necessary policies to contribute to the conscious and efficient use of Energy.</p>
<p>The PNEDUCEEE is the instrument that manages to contain the Programs, Projects, Activities focused on efficient energy management and has among its purposes: to design and coordinate the implementation of five (5) Programs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Energy Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardization and Labeling of Energy Efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy Efficient Buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sectoral: Residential, Public and Private.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Energy Efficiency in the National Electric System. The PNEA aims to promote the development, use and exploitation of alternative energies, favoring the generation of the use of renewable sources for the sustainable development of productive sectors, proposing the following specific objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diversify the electricity generation matrix with the development of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro and biomass, among others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote training and dissemination programs on renewable energy sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consolidate a technical and legal regulatory framework to regulate the development and use of renewable energy sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote International Cooperation in renewable energies promoting financing schemes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote national financing in renewable energies by promoting financing schemes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide advice and technical assistance to public and private initiatives in renewable energy projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within this context, a set of actions focused on the Rational and Efficient Use of energy are presented as policies framed in the CND based on what was agreed under the UNFCCC. The Electricity Sector through the governing body of the MPPEE committed to the construction of an eco-socialist productive economic model, presents here some of its contributions in this matter. These actions are articulated within the framework of the Economic and Social Development Plan of the Nation, in which the deepening of ecosocialist policies with a high social, economic and environmental impact in terms of Climate Change is proposed.</p>
<p>The MPPEE presents ambitious contributions in mitigation, encompassing actions and policies towards fair and sustainable development. Below is a list of climate policies contained in the official document of the Nationally Determined Contributions of Venezuela, presented in 2017, which must be applied to the previous criteria, as well as to the new policies outlined in the La Patria Plan. corresponding to each government entity. Table 01 shows the CND corresponding to the Energy Sector and Table 02 presents them for the Alternative Energies Sector.</p>

<h3><a>Oil: Petróleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA)</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Popular Power for Petroleum, through its company Petróleos de Venezuela PDVSA, directs the nation's oil production policy. In this sense, as a Venezuelan state company, in perfect alignment with the guidelines of the national government, it reaffirms its commitment to maintaining the 14,423 hectares of carbon sink forests constituted by the compensatory plantations required in the environmental authorizations associated with investment projects. and of the environmental protection forests under the custody of the oil industry. Similarly, and with the strategic vision of reducing the burning and venting of natural gas in PDVSA's operational areas, projects will be carried out to take advantage of this valuable energy resource in line with the provisions of the Plan de la Patria 2019 - 2025. </p>
<p>The strategy to be followed by the Venezuelan oil industry will be redefined considering the double challenge that is presented to us, as the first challenge, we have the goals established in the determined national contribution and in parallel, we must stand up to the unilateral coercive measures imposed against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by those nations that have historically been the ones that have had the greatest negative impact against the climate, basing their economic development on the capitalist accumulation model.</p>
<p>The unilateral coercive measures have had a substantial negative impact on PDVSA's income and productive capacities, forcing it to allocate resources to core elements of the company to maintain its operations, however, beyond considering these restrictions a permanent condition in The corporation's ability to address environmental aspects becomes an element that forces us to restructure the action mechanisms based on the commitment of the workers and the creative force of the communities where it is expected to continue with the reforestation programs. forest maintenance and the execution of projects to minimize the burning and venting of natural gas.

<h3><a>Transportation</a></h3>
<p>Venezuela has a network of highways and highways of more than 96,000 km, which cover most of the national territory. It is one of the most developed networks in Latin America. The density of roads is higher in the central-northern region of the country, where the majority of the population is concentrated.</p>
<p>Currently, transportation activities are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of People's Power for Transportation, an institution focused on optimizing land, air, and water transportation services, road infrastructure, and related services. A fundamental tool to achieve this objective was the creation, in 2014, of the Transport Mission, which has achieved numerous achievements.</p>
<p>The country has urban land and underground transportation systems, created or significantly expanded in recent years, which include the Caracas Metro, Maracaibo Metro, Valencia Metro, Los Teques Metro, and metrocables (in various areas of difficult to access) and bus systems with exclusive use routes (Trolebús Mérida, Bus Caracas, TransMaracay, TransBarca, TransCarabobo, TransFalcón and TransAnzoátegui).</p>
<p>Regarding water transport, Venezuela has a series of ports in the Caribbean Sea, among which Amuay, Bajo Grande, El Tablazo, La Guaira, La Salina, Maracaibo, Puerto Cabello, Puerto La Cruz, Puerto Sucre, Guanta stand out , Punta Cardón and Punta de Piedras. In addition, there are important river ports such as Puerto Ordaz, Palua and Matanzas, located on the Orinoco River.</p>
<p>It also has 127 airports with paved runways (air transport), fifteen of them with runways longer than 2,500 meters. These include the international airports of Maiquetía, Valencia, Punto Fijo, Porlamar, Maracaibo,</p>
<p>Barcelona, Barquisimeto, San Cristóbal, Ciudad Guayana, Maturín, Cumaná and San Antonio del Táchira.</p>
<p>Regarding railways, Venezuela has 447 km of expanding railway lines. Below is Table 04 referring to the CND of the Land and Underground Transportation Sector - Trolebús Mérida, CA -Tromerca; in Table 5 the Land and Underground Transportation Sector - Yutong Venezuela, SA Bus Plant; in Table 6 for the Terrestrial and Underground Transport Sector - José Antonio Anzoátegui Socialist Transport System” SA - TRANZOATEGUI; in the Table for the Land and Underground Transportation Sector – Metro de Caracas, CA; in Table 8 for the Water Transport Sector - Corporación Venezolana de Navegación, SA (Venavega); and in Table 9 Air Transport Sector - National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (INAC).</p>

<h3>10.2.2. Industry Sector</h3>
<h3>General Directorate of Environmental Quality Management (FONDOIN)</h3>
<p>The role of the State as a regulatory entity in the industrialization of the country is very important. Among the entities in charge of the regulation, formulation and monitoring of policies, planning and carrying out activities in the field of industries, there is the Ministry of People's Power of Industries and National Production.</p>
<p>Given the progressive depletion of the ozone layer caused by the worldwide use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), the Venezuelan State, in observance of a policy that is respectful of the conservation of the environment and especially of the ozone layer, it became a Party in 1987 to the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer as well as its Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, two years later. Recently, the National Assembly approved in second discussion the incorporation of the Kigali Amendment, in October 2021.</p>
<p>The legal regime created through these international instruments indicates criteria that seek to achieve a gradual reduction in the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances, with the ultimate goal of eliminating them. Taking into account the provisions of the Vienna Convention and the control provisions on substances that deplete the ozone layer (ODS) contained in the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, as well as the decisions taken at the international meetings of said agreements. </p>
<p>In this sense, a National Plan for the Progressive Elimination of Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was developed in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in which activities associated with awareness-raising, training and reconversion of the use of these substances have been carried out. substances (HCFC hydrochlorofluorocarbons) to non-exhausting alternatives. Among the activities that have been carried out, the following can be mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support and technical assistance to strengthen the legal framework to discuss the import ban, control of new installations with refrigeration and air conditioning equipment that use HCFCs and HFCs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update of training material on good practices for refrigeration to address three levels of basic, intermediate and advanced training according to the level of training of the technician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution of informative game material, informative and educational material on best practices to refrigeration technicians; the ozone layer and the climate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of the Zero Leaks Program in the hospital and food preservation sectors and private service companies. Training in equipment and refrigerant conservation, and technical assistance to large end users on equipment inventory and evaluation, equipment repair (leaks), development of equipment and refrigerant performance indices. The program was able to help 40 different facilities; This program encourages avoiding leaks, one of the main causes of ozone depletion and global warming, and encourages reconversion to natural substances. The project is currently being disseminated in the state of Mérida.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informative campaign to promote eco-energy technologies with low global warming potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconversion in the Caricuao Maternal and Child Hospital, the project began in 2018 executing the first phase, which consisted of installing an ice water system consisting of a "chiller" with a capacity of 5 tons of refrigeration and which uses R-290 (propane) as a refrigerant and which supplies fresh air to the pediatric ward B. During 2019, the planning was structured, associated with the execution of the second phase of the project, which consists of the reconversion and repowering of three (3) 20 Tr "chillers", which currently contain R-22 and which will use R-290, once the work is done. The hospital areas benefited from this project were: Operating room A, Operating room B, Recovery room, Corridor connecting operating rooms A and B and the Recovery room, Office areas 20, Delivery and pre-delivery room.</p >
</li>
<li>
<p>In the area of air conditioning, the Puerto Escondido Inn, located in Cepe, Aragua state, was converted using R-290, into twelve (12), window air conditioners with capacities between 10,000 and 12,000 BTU/h, this being an example that the HC refrigerant can be applied safely in this type of equipment, as long as they comply with the safety regulations and with the maximum refrigerant charges established in the UNE-EN-378 standard.</p >
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the reduction percentage, before the emergence of the Kigali Amendment, the options or alternatives provided for the replacement of ODS were hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).</p>
<p>According to our progressive elimination schedule, we have reduced the consumption of substances that deplete the ozone layer by more than 35%. This reduction is based on the reduction of imports and production of the substances.</p>
<p>Currently, through FONDOIN, Venezuela is in a campaign to promote the use of natural alternatives such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, hydrocarbons such as R-290, R-600 and R-600a in the refrigeration sector, which do not deplete ozone and do not contribute to global warming.</p>
<p>Regarding Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), they correspond to substances used as substitutes for ODS, which do not deplete the Ozone Layer but have negative impacts on the environment due to their high global warming potential ; This inclusion makes clear the recognition and co-responsibility of the Parties in assuming control of these substances whose use has increased exponentially due to the global and progressive elimination of ODS.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Venezuelan State is committed to the construction and promotion of the eco-socialist productive economic model, based on a harmonious relationship between human beings and nature, which guarantees the rational, optimal and sustainable use and exploitation of natural resources. , respecting the processes and cycles of nature, within the framework of the 5 Historical Objective of the Homeland Plan that establishes: "Contribute to the preservation of life on the planet and the salvation of the human species", has historically assumed international commitments environmental, which include the protection of the ozone layer.</p>
<p>In this way, in October 2016, the 28th Meeting of the Parties (MOP28) held in Rwanda Kigali -Decision XXVII/1.-, approved the amendment that includes the control of HFCs in the mentioned protocol. In it, it is agreed to regulate the consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which leads to assuming new challenges and commitments.</p>
<p>The MINEC has carried out commemorative activities on the International Day of the Ozone Layer such as: the use of bicycles to promote mobility and the change of modes of transport for a more sustainable one and dance therapies, puppet shows, conferences reforestation, beach cleaning, awareness workshops on the ozone layer).</p>
<p>The MINEC developed a street operation, through the Territorial Units aimed at companies in the maintenance sector that provide services in the installation or repair of air conditioners, in order to provide guidance on the safe handling of exhausting substances of the ozone layer and with a high potential for global warming, as well as to require their registration in the register of activities capable of degrading the environment.</p>
<p>The MINEC, hand in hand with FONDOIN, has carried out training workshops to strengthen the control mechanisms for the trade in substances and equipment that use HCFCs and HFCs, with the participation of SENIAT and the Bolivarian National Guard, managing to train government officials.</p>
<p>As part of the Play Learning Program carried out by FONDOIN, with the cooperation of the children's museum, a display of activities was developed such as: Friends of the Earth Routes, “Friends of the Earth” Ecological Practices Workshops and the Institutional program of FONDOIN.

<p>FONDOIN is currently in the process of obtaining accreditation from SENCAMER, in order to give more strength to the training program for refrigeration technicians at its various basic, intermediate and advanced levels, in order to continue training and raising awareness of good practices and avoiding gas leaks.</p>
<p>Likewise, within the framework of promoting the use of hydrocarbons as alternative refrigerants, we are working together with the Directorate of Emissions and Effluents, FONDOIN and SENCAMER on the COVENIN Venezuelan Standard Project called Guide for the Safe Use of Flammable Refrigerants in Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Systems, as a measure as well as in a special program for the handling and use of hydrocarbons in refrigeration systems, much more demanding due to the risks associated with the substance.</p>
<p>In the framework of the schedule for the elimination of Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), substances listed in Group I of Annex C of the Montreal Protocol, the General Directorate of Environmental Quality Management through the Directorate of Emissions and Effluents has designed different strategies taking into account the country's commitments to eliminate HCFCs. Among them, it is imperative to update the current regulatory framework, to continue guaranteeing compliance with the commitments acquired by the country within the framework of the Montreal Protocol.</p>
<p>In this context, the regulatory framework has been essential to support the strategies proposed and advanced in the country, in terms of controlling the consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), in which the line was established. country consumption base, controlled substances, phase-out schedule, and trade control measures to comply with HCFC phase-out schedules.</p>
<p>There is currently a proposal to update Decree No. 4335 hand in hand with FONDOIN and which is mainly related to the commitments assumed at the Nineteenth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, held from 17 to 21 of September 2007, in which Decision XIX/6 was prepared on adjustments to the aforementioned Protocol in relation to controlled substances in Group I of Annex C (Hydrochlorofluorocarbons).</p>
<p>In this provision, the Parties agree to accelerate the production and consumption of HCFCs, making an adjustment in accordance with paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, prior to the approval of the Kigali Amendment, once again demonstrating its commitment to environmental issues, promulgated in 2015 Resolution 227 related to the "Standards on the Control, Importation and Management of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)”, Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No. 40,693 dated July 1, 2015 and for which there is currently an update proposal.</p>
<p>It is estimated that by the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022 the proposed standard will already be published, likewise, anticipating that this standard will be reviewed every two years by virtue of the dynamics of the Montreal Protocol and the Amendment from Kigali.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is currently a Technical Standards Committee (CT25) chaired by SENCAMER and in which state institutions binding on refrigerant gases are a part. Said committee is currently preparing the following proposals for technical standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Substances to be used as refrigerants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detection and Control of Refrigerant Leaks in Industrial or Commercial Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Systems.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the plan is fundamentally based on reducing the consumption and imports of ODS refrigerants and with warming potentials above 500GWP. So it must be based firstly on a robust refrigeration training program accompanied by the certification program and secondly on having an updated regulation up to the Kigali provisions, which is enforced with a post control program to follow up on the products that go on the market.</p>

<h3>10.2.3. Forest Sector (General Directorate of Forest Heritage - Misión Árbol Foundation)</h3>
<p>The country's forest heritage covers all the ecosystems and forest resources included in the national territory, including natural forests, forest plantations, trees outside the forest, as well as forest lands and associated non-tree vegetation forms or not to the forest.</p>
<p>Much of the surface of Venezuela is covered by an enormous variety of tropical forests, very complex and biodiverse mosaics, which vary from forests just a few meters high and with a single layer, to large, multi-layered forests , between 40-50 m or more in height; There are also forests dominated by practically a single species (contemporary), alongside forests with 150 to 200 tree species per hectare (heteroetaneous). Forests in Venezuela tend to grow in all terrestrial and floodplain environments of the low, medium, and highlands, up to an approximate elevation of 3,000 m asl in the Andes region (the vast majority between 0 and 2,500 m asl, that is, , the macrothermal and mesothermal zones of the country). Even above this general limit of trees, there is another type of forest, the chiribital, which forms very isolated and small tree communities in surface area and in heights up to 3,800 / 4,200 m asl</p>
<p>Among the main forest formations of Venezuela we have: humid forests, dry forests, cloud forests, evergreen forests, mangrove forests and palm forests.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Ministry of People's Power for the Environment, today MINEC, published the vegetation cover map of Venezuela, at a scale of 1:2,000,000, presenting the updated cartography of the country's vegetation cover, in 75 letters on a scale of 1:250,000.</p>
<p>A good proportion of this Venezuelan forest heritage is under the ABRAE category, which represents 67.52% of the total land area of the country, where the functions of protection and conservation of biological diversity assigned to forests represent 37.26%; the function of forest production under management plans represents 17.7% and the remaining 19.11% is given by the multiple use function of the forest. This protection condition includes the country among the ten nations with the largest extension of forests designated for the protection of soil and water (FAO, 2016).</p>
<p>Deforestation in Venezuela, for the decade 1990-2000 was 288,000 ha/year and for the following decade 2000-2010 it was 164,600 ha/year, reducing the loss of forest cover by 42.9% (MPPA, 2010).</p>
<p>Forest plantations for commercial purposes have been developed mainly by the public sector with a participation of 72.7%; only 27.24 corresponds to the private sector. By 2013, the planted forest area reached 557,000 ha (Forest Statistics, 2009 - 2013. Ministry of People's Power for the Environment).</p>
<p>In the framework of the new national forest policy and the current forest law (2013), the orientation of the use of the national forest patrimony entails substantive changes in terms of management and the model of forest development to follow. Currently, the Forestry sector constitutes one of the development engines of the Bolivarian Economic Agenda to strengthen the ecosocialist productive model. Below is Table 14, referring to the CNDs, presented by the Forest Sector (General Directorate of Forest Heritage) and Table 15 for the Forest Sector (Misión Árbol Foundation).</p>

<h3>10.2.4. Waste Sector</h3>
<p>The coverage of solid waste collection services reached 85% of the country for the year 2010, an increase of 11% in relation to the year 1999. On the other hand, the amount of solid waste generated had increased from 7 million tons per year in 1999 to 10 million in 2010, and the daily generation per person from 0.79 to 0.98 kilos in the same period.</p>
<p>The collection of municipal solid waste by state is proportional to the number of inhabitants, with the states of Zulia, Miranda, Carabobo, Anzoátegui and the Capital District being the states with the largest amount of waste collected. Most of the waste goes to landfills with varying levels of control and management. Table 16 is presented below, referring to the CND corresponding to the Waste Sector.</p>

<h3>11. GUIDELINE 2. ADAPTATION</h3>
<p>Article 4 of the Framework Convention establishes that the Parties must formulate, apply, publish and regularly update national and, as appropriate, regional programs that contain (...) measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change.</ p>
<p>With the Paris Agreement, the adaptation approach is strengthened; specifically in its article 2, literal b, which raises the need to increase the capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and promote climate resilience and development with low GHG emissions; Similarly, Article 7 establishes a global adaptation goal, recognizing that the current need for adaptation is considerable, and that a lower level of mitigation will increase the need for additional adaptation efforts.</p>
<p>Both legal frameworks on climate change (UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement) guide the preparation and content of the Adaptation Communication.</p>
<p>The Report of Group I on the Physical Basis of Climate Change (2021), from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), concludes that warming in the climate system is a reality and that changes are being observed that they are unprecedented. Significant changes in weather variables, particularly precipitation and temperature, jeopardize the normal development of society in many countries, and especially the low-income population of so-called developing countries, who will suffer the most negative effects due to its greater vulnerability.</p>
<p>In September 2015, the UN approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, together with an Agenda that includes 17 SDGs and 169 goals to be achieved by countries in the period 2016-2030 in order to move towards a more sustainable world. sustainable. Goal 13 of the SDGs is aimed at: "Adopt urgent measures against climate change".</p>
<p>In turn, this objective presents five goals that include, among others: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to risks related to climate and natural disasters in all countries; incorporate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and plans; and improve education, awareness, and human and institutional capacity in relation to climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.</p>
<p>Article 127 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (CRBV) determines that the enjoyment of a safe, healthy and ecologically balanced life and environment is an individual and collective right. Likewise, the CRBV article 55 prescribes that</p>
<p>…everyone has the right to protection by the State through citizen security bodies regulated by law, in the face of situations that constitute a threat, vulnerability or risk to the physical integrity of people, their property, the enjoyment of their rights and the fulfillment of their duties.”</p>
<p>With respect to the legislation that may be relevant to the processes of adaptation to climate change, the Organic Law of the Environment of 2006, in its Article 23 includes as part of the guidelines for environmental planning the insertion in them of risk prevention systems.</p>
<p>In terms of law, Venezuela has a substantial legal and regulatory framework that regulates the implementation of policies, programs, plans, and projects, and bases the actions of the State aimed at adapting to the effects of climate change, to face the conditions of vulnerability.</p>
<p>In the first instance, there is the Plan for the Homeland 2019 - 2025, now converted into law, which develops five historical objectives, being the 5th Historical Objective: Contribute to the preservation of life on the planet and the salvation of the species which expresses the guidelines and mandates related to the environmental issue and specifically to climate change in the national objective 5.4.</p>
<p>Likewise, in Venezuela the disaster prevention and care guidelines of various international bodies have been adopted, such as the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction - EIRD.</p>
<p>In the framework of the ISDR, Venezuela participated in the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, held in 2005 in Kobe - Japan. In said event, the Hyogo Framework for Action - MAH, 2005 - 2015 was adopted, whose general objective is to increase the resilience of nations and communities in the face of disasters by achieving, by 2015, a considerable reduction in losses caused by disasters, both in terms of human lives and in terms of the social, economic and environmental assets of communities and countries.</p>
<p>From the perspective of shared but differentiated responsibilities, Venezuela has been developing State policies in correlative actions to adaptation to Climate Change and the commitments assumed in the framework of the UNFCCC.</p>
<h3>11.1. INFORMATION ON THE IMPACTS, RISKS AND VULNERABILITY REGARDING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
<p>Venezuela's vulnerability to climate change was pioneered by those developed within the framework of the Pan-Earth Project (Harwell, 1993), which allowed the generation of the first Climate Change scenarios for Venezuela, based on atmospheric circulation models. . Subsequently, various studies were carried out on possible impacts on the agricultural sector, on coastal areas and on water resources (Acevedo et al, 1995; Maytin et al, 1995; Olivo et al, 2001).</p>
<p>More recently, and as mentioned above, the First National Communication on Climate Change (MARN, 2005) was published, which in addition to including a Second National Inventory of GHG Emissions, carried out in 1999, presents the results of the studies carried out in Venezuela, to determine the climatic vulnerability of the country, the associated impacts and adaptation measures.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provides for the management of risks and emergencies as powers of the National Public Power, as well as the Law of the National Organization for Civil Protection and Disaster Management, where a multidisciplinary process is being developed and multisectoral to incorporate risk management and disaster reduction into economic and social development planning.</p>
<p>The ministries related to the matter participate in this process (Environment, Science and Technology, Education, Culture and Sports, Higher Education, Agriculture and Land, Energy and Mines, Health and Social Development, Interior and Justice, and Foreign Affairs) , in addition to companies linked to specific sectors, such as the water sector (HIDROVEN) and the oil sector (PDVSA), as well as other related academic organizations and institutions, such as the Simón Bolívar Geographic Institute of Venezuela and universities.</p >
<p>At the Andean regional level, Venezuela participates in the Andean Committee for Disaster Prevention and Response (CAPRADE), where the Andean Strategy for Disaster Prevention and Response has been formulated.</p>
<p>Coordination efforts at the national level are carried out through the National Coordinating Committee for Civil Protection and Disaster Management, which is made up of all offices of the National Executive and groups the sectors and levels of government, with the participation of the representation of state governors, mayors and non-governmental organizations, as well as the National Coordination of Firefighters and civil emergency management organizations. Within the Committee, the constitution of sectoral technical subcommittees and specialized work teams for actions and measures in the field of civil protection and disaster management is also foreseen.</p>
<p>In compliance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic and the general lines of Foreign Policy, the country has adopted the guidelines for disaster prevention and care of various international instances, such as the International Strategy for the Reduction of Disasters - ISDR.</p>
<h3>11.2. NATIONAL ADAPTATION TARGET</h3>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela assumes the political commitment at the highest level for the adaptation of all the organs and entities of the Public Administration in their operational plans for the implementation of the SDGs.</p>
<p>To achieve success in adaptation, it is necessary to add continuous efforts from all social actors, since a profound change is required in production models, patterns of use of natural resources and in the consumption of goods and services. </p>
<p>In this sense, the objectives should be achieved as appropriate:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduce vulnerability to the effects of climate change by building adaptive capacity and resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation, in a coherent manner, into relevant new and existing policies, programs and activities, in particular development planning processes and strategies, across all relevant sectors and across the different levels.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>11.2.1. Transversal Approaches that guide Adaptation</h3>
<p>Venezuela presents ambitious contributions in adaptation, encompassing actions and policies towards fair and sustainable development. These contributions have been advanced voluntarily and with their own financing, framed in the Economic and Social Development Plan of the Nation (Plan de la Patria), which establishes the priority of the fight against Climate Change within the framework of a development integral, humanist and ecosocialist oriented to Good Living in harmony with Mother Earth.</a></p>
<h3>11.2.2. Actions and Programs with Impact on Adaptation</h3>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela presents through this document, its Nationally Determined Contributions (CND), through actions and programs with an impact on Adaptation, for the fight against Climate Change and its effects, taking into consideration the provisions of decisions under the UNFCCC, 1992, the Paris Agreement 2015.</p>

<h3>11.3.1. Agriculture Sector (Food Safety)</h3>
<p>The agricultural sector is one of those that presents the greatest risk in the face of climate change, coupled with anthropogenic processes, the more drastic the climate changes, the greater the challenge for farmers or producers, in terms of the conditions for the production and benefits derived from the activity.</p>
<p>However, a large part of the greenhouse gases worldwide come from this sector, mainly due to the intensive use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, the digestive process of ruminants, the excessive use of fossil energy and the management and use Inadequate soil (erosion, contamination), therefore agricultural activity has a great responsibility in climate change, but it is also one of the most affected by it.</p>
<p>Various alternatives have been generated worldwide to remedy this situation. Agroecology emerges as a type of alternative and ancestral agriculture, to face conventional practices, by promoting sustainable practices such as the production and use of bio-inputs, cover crops, as well as the combination between crops and livestock, agroforestry, among others, that allow greater carbon sequestration; in it, the materialism of conventional agriculture is replaced by a vision that is more respectful of the environment and seeks to coexist with the environment without harming it, and as an added value to minimize environmental impact and food safety.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that climate change affects the phenology patterns of crops and yields, which is why the Ministry of People's Power for Productive Agriculture and Land (MPPAPT), through the National Institute of Comprehensive Agricultural Health (INSAI) ), its bioinputs laboratories provide farmers with biological agricultural inputs, in order to reduce the toxic load and carbon footprint, reduce production costs and have more resilient and sustainable systems.</p>
<p>In addition to these policies, INSAI has carried out recruitment, training and accompaniment activities for agroecological or organic production to producers (small, large, rural, urban, among others) at the national level, in which they are trained in the artisanal production and use of agroecological inputs (biols, slurry, organic fertilizers, green fertilizers, mineral mixtures, etc.), with the purpose of making them appropriate these technologies and this will allow them to make changes and adjustments in the face of changes climatic.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to highlight that in recent years the efforts made have been undermined by the impact of the coercive and unilateral measures to which the country has been subjected and the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing productive capacity of the bioinputs laboratories and the number of recruitment, training and accompaniment activities for agroecological or organic production to producers.

<p>Sustainable cocoa production is essential to improve the quality of life of our cocoa farmers, however, within the consumption of natural resources, as already mentioned, there are forms of production that wear out and degrade these resources, agriculture being one of the of the activities that, when improperly applied, contribute to this problem. Despite the cocoa crop has some particular characteristics that make it a sustainable system of agricultural production, cocoa plantations are founded on agroforestry systems that maintain synergies between its components, allowing the use of litter from forest trees and cocoa to contribute organic material to the soil, in addition to creating a plant cover that protects the soil from abiotic factors, in this sense within this system a microclimate is created for plants such as heliconias that serve as a niche for cocoa pollinating insects. These are just some of the interactions provided by this type of system, which are recognized as ecological and conservationist. For these reasons, the agricultural production of cocoa is a modality of sustainable consumption.</p>

<p>Urban Agriculture is a factor that plays an important role in relation to food security, with more than one hundred (100) million people involved in urban horticulture, this organic and community practice is growing exponentially. Where urban agriculture contributes to both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. For this reason, it is among the most adopted current instruments to create resilient food systems.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector is a major source of pollution, being responsible for between 20% and 30% of carbon emissions worldwide.</p>
<p>Urban agriculture, on the other hand, is usually characterized by the use of sustainable practices, which are beneficial to the soil. Also, instead of requiring massive amounts of clean water, innovative systems can be adopted to recycle gray water. This can be done by diverting rainfall in the rainy season or storing used water in the home, to later water plants. Likewise, urban waste management programs can transform organic matter into natural fertilizers, which will later be used in Urban Agriculture projects.</p>
<p>These Fertilizers replace chemical fertilizers made from petroleum and reduce methane emissions in dumps. These practices not only reduce the use of harmful agricultural inputs, but also decrease urban pollution and thus mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The local character of urban agriculture can drastically decrease the contribution that conventional agriculture makes and contributes to ameliorating climate change.</p>
<p>Buying local food significantly decreases “food mileage”, that is, the distance that goods travel to reach consumers. It also reduces carbon emissions, related to transportation.</p>
<p>Urban agriculture contributes to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change with the production of good quality food, minimizing the anticipated drastic effects on the supply and demand of food generated by environmental changes. In this context, urban and peri-urban agriculture can increase the production of fresh and nutritious food in a city. Therefore, urban agriculture not only helps mitigate climate change, but also helps build more resilient food systems and improve food security.</p>
<p>Because guaranteeing the right to food is a complex task that depends on many factors, it should not be the sole responsibility of the national government. On the contrary, citizens, in the private sector and municipal and state governments, who can and should play an active role.</p>
<p>Strategies:</p>
<p>To increase food security and sovereignty at the local and national levels, local actors can implement strategies and policies with a view to creating a just and sustainable food system. In this sense, it is considered essential to complement the traditional food production and supply systems, promoting urban and peri-urban agriculture, through the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establishing an action plan to face the effects of climate change, which integrates different entities and government levels, adapted both to different forms of agriculture and to different climatic zones of the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying areas susceptible to fires, floods and other severe weather events in both urban and rural areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating contingency programs, such as the activation of the P (Production) of the Claps, of 10,000 Claps through planting and breeding to produce some 270,000 tons of food to cover some 500,000 families.</p >
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing and/or subsidizing natural conservation practices, to build resilience to climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing support funds to farmers, interested in making a transition from inputs, with petroleum derivatives and synthetic fertilizers, towards natural methods for pest control and soil fertility recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating training programs, crop rotation to mitigate the spread of pests and the impact of climate change.</p>

<h3>Water Sector</h3>
<p>Venezuela is positioned among the first 11 nations with proven reserves of fresh water on the planet, a unique and limited natural resource, essential for the life and development of the Nation. As a people, we assume the task of managing water in a context of multiform war against our country, in the midst of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, facing climate change, and as part of the construction of our Bolivarian Socialism as only alternative to the capitalist debacle and its effects.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of water for life, sovereignty and peace, on June 15, 2018 the Ministry of Popular Power for Water Attention was created by instruction of our President Nicolás Maduro, marking a historic milestone by creating For the first time in our Republic, a scientific-technical entity that exclusively assumes the powers assigned by the National Executive for the eco-socialist management of waters, based on the sustainable administration of the 16 hydrographic regions to ensure the protection and safeguarding of the sources, fair and equitable access to water for its different uses and sanitation, under a public, democratic, participatory and protagonist management scheme.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela establishes in its article 304 that “all waters are assets of the public domain of the nation, irreplaceable for life and development. The law will establish the necessary provisions in order to guarantee its protection, use and recovery, respecting the phases of the hydrological cycle and the criteria of territorial planning”.</p>
<p>Based on the constitutional mandate, on April 6, 2019, the National Consultation for the preparation of the National Water System Plan was held, bringing together different actors with competencies related to the sector, resulting in 6 vertices of action whose strategic lines and actions were updated collectively by the water worker people in August 2020.</p>
<p>The first vertex is the Popular Government of Waters and includes the strengthening and development of Technical Water Boards, Community Water Management Rooms, community Brigades, community information networks, massive reporting systems, the registry of public distributors and private water companies, a new legal framework for water and the execution of community projects to improve the drinking water and sanitation service.</p>
<p>The second vertex of action refers to the Strengthening of the National Water System</p>
<p>More Water for the People! and contemplates actions for the financial sustainability of the service, development of the map of solutions for the national water system, electric self-generation in the systems, recovery of the vehicle fleet and heavy machinery, communications system in facilities of the water system and sovereign production of substances and reagents chemicals.</p>
<p>The third vertex corresponds to the Integral Security of the Water System and seeks to guarantee and strengthen physical, technological and industrial security in all processes of the national water system, in coordination with the different State security bodies.</p>
<p>The fourth vertex refers to Education, Technological Innovation and Productive Chain through the development of educational programs, communication campaigns, undergraduate and postgraduate courses on water, alternative collection and purification techniques, preservation of ancestral knowledge, design of prototypes of parts and pieces, comprehensive study of hydrographic basins and everything related to the implementation of the National Water Industry.</p>
<p>The fifth vertex corresponds to the Comprehensive Transformation of the Management Model and groups actions for the strengthening of water stewardship mechanisms and the revolutionary transfer of the service to organized communities, in addition to actions for recruitment, training and attention integral part of the water worker town.</p>
<p>The sixth vertex groups actions for the Sowing and Harvesting of Water that include strategies for the protection and recovery of water at the source, a network for monitoring water quantity and quality, institutional organization through the Councils of Hydrographic Regions and Councils of Hydrographic Basins, administrative control of the use of water at the source, storage in reservoirs, control and management of groundwater, in addition to the comprehensive management of risks of floods, droughts and structural failures of dams and complementary works that may negatively affect the people and their property.</p>
<p>So, we have a strategic plan to continue advancing together in the comprehensive management of water, in line with our Plan for the Homeland 2019 - 2025 and in order to comply with SDG 6 of the UN 2030 Agenda and of the different international agreements.</p>
<p>Within this context, File 04 is presented below, referring to the Policies of Nationally Determined Contributions presented by the Water Sector.</p>

<p>In our country, 10.6 billion cubic meters of raw water are extracted annually, of which 54% is used for electricity generation, 35% for human consumption, 6% for agriculture, livestock and forestry, and 5% for the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the coverage of the drinking water service, it should be noted that <strong>Venezuela reached in 2007 (eight years before the agreed date) the millennium goal established in the UN Agenda</strong>, by achieve access to drinking water for 96% of the population, in a process that involves more than 2,023 installations, more than 32,000 kilometers of pipes and more than 18,000 deep wells nationwide. On the other hand, we have also managed to collect 70% of the sewage.</p>
<p>In heroic action of resistance, <strong>the water workers increased the production capacity of drinking water</strong> to 134,400 liters per second in the year 2020, all amid the aggression of the United States of North America and the European Union through unilateral coercive measures, within the framework of the recovery of the National Electric System after the systematic criminal attack carried out in 2019, which has conspired against the efficiency and quality of water service provision potable since 95% of the systems require electricity to operate; and also facing strong periods of drought from 2013 to 2017 and during 2019 and part of 2020.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have made progress in the <strong>popular organization with a view to the revolutionary transfer of the service</strong>, reaching 4,670 active technical water tables in 2020 with the participation of 11,124 spokespersons in addition to the formation of Community Brigades for the repair of minor breakdowns and for the protection and safeguarding of sources.</p>
<p>On the other hand, legal stewardship over water in all its forms, today does not respond to a single and uniform <strong>legal regime</strong>, but rather is dispersed in various regulatory bodies. In this sense, on June 8, 2021, the proposal presented by the Permanent Commission of Administration and Services of the National Assembly that will unify the Water Law and the Provision Law in a single body was unanimously approved in First Discussion. of the Drinking Water and Sanitation Services.</p>
<p>Regarding the <strong>awareness of the use, protection and exploitation of water,</strong> promoting the recovery of ancestral practices and knowledge, the “Water Program” has been implemented in more than 2,750 educational institutions. in our Lives” that seeks to sensitize children and adolescents through different recreational-pedagogical tools, among which is the Video Game “Caminos del Agua”, an application for Android and Canaima 4.0 onwards, developed within the framework of the TECNI-CIENCI-ANDO project.</p>
<p>The awareness and promotion of a new culture of water is promoted in all areas and levels. Technical training is added to school training through the Comprehensive Management of Water Resources Diploma issued together with the Fundación Escuela Venezolana de Planificación; the Chair for Alternative Water Planting, the Trainer of Trainers diploma and the accreditation of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees through the Simón Rodríguez National Experimental University; the cohorts of Assistant and Higher Technician in Water Engineering and PNF of Water Engineering together with the Territorial Polytechnic Universities.</p>
<p>Regarding the <strong>protection and preservation of water in sources</strong>, as one of the actions for adaptation to climate change, we continue to carry out dredging, removal of bora, cleaning of discharge channels , reservoir rehabilitation and maintenance works, flood control works and updating and characterization of the well network. In addition, we have the National Fund for Integral Water Management (FONAGUAS), the Strategic Security Plan for the National Water System and the National Security Plan for the Reservoir System of Venezuela.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Global atmospheric circulation climate models (GCMs) are an important tool for assessing climate change risks under different development scenarios. However, its application at the regional and country scale is difficult due to the spatial scale and the different assumptions under which they are elaborated, which do not necessarily respond to certain regional characteristics. Thus, its application requires a performance evaluation for the selection of the models to be regionalized through rescaling. The results of the regional Climate Models under different future scenarios will allow the elaboration of the lines of action to be considered within the plan and the adaptation strategies for Climate Change, allowing adaptation planning in sectors such as health, especially in the case of vector-borne diseases; the energy sector, given that the generation of electricity in our country is highly vulnerable to extremes of drought; the water and food sector; biodiversity and ecosystem conservation; among others. They will also allow the development of studies for the inventory of greenhouse gases and have precise technical information for voluntary mitigation.

<h3>11.3.7. Basic Education Sector</h3>
<p>Environmental problems and disasters have become one of the greatest political, economic, scientific and educational concerns worldwide, on whose solution depends, to a large extent, the existence of life on earth. It is necessary to work steadily for the protection of the environment and reduce the risks of disasters, as well as prepare to act in emergencies and simultaneously work to achieve world harmony, eradicate hunger, terrorism, wars and attend to the health of the human being. </p>
<p>In this sense, since the Constituent process initiated in 1999, the need to establish the guidelines that would allow the promotion of comprehensive measures to face the challenges of climate change was envisioned, for which the new Magna Carta includes in its article 107 the obligatory nature of Environmental Education in the levels and modalities of the educational system, as well as in non-formal citizen education.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Organic Law of the Environment (2006) defines Environmental Education as the continuous, interactive and integrating process, through which the human being acquires knowledge and experiences, understands and analyzes them, internalizes them and translates them into behaviors, values and attitudes that prepare them to take a leading role in environmental management and sustainable development (art. 3); which aims to promote, generate, and consolidate in citizens knowledge, skills and attitudes to contribute to the transformation of society, which will be reflected in alternative solutions to socio-environmental problems, thus contributing to the achievement of well-being social, integrating into the management of the environment through active and leading participation, under the premise of sustainable development (art.34).</p>
<p>Similarly, the Organic Law of Education of 2009 contemplates as one of the purposes of education to promote the formation of an ecological conscience to preserve biodiversity and socio-diversity, environmental conditions and the rational use of natural resources (art. 15.5).</p>
<p>Since 2007, the Ministry of Popular Power for Education (MPPE), responding to the need to strengthen the educational system, has prepared a curricular proposal that contains theoretical orientations, objectives, integrating axes, and profiles of students and teachers , in addition to the functional orientations (relationships in practice between teachers, learning areas, curricula, learning experiences and evaluation).</p>
<p>Among the integrating axes of the Bolivarian National Curriculum of the Basic Education Subsystem, we have "Environment and Integral Health" aimed at promoting the development of harmonious relationships between human beings and nature (environment), highlighting the importance of seeing the whole , Planet Earth as an integrated system; where human beings are immersed; where we must learn to take advantage of and make rational and conscious use of natural resources.</p>
<p>In addition, it promotes the understanding of comprehensive health, from all aspects (sexual reproduction, risk management, recreation, nutrition, among others), thus minimizing threat scenarios, natural physical risks and social impacts, which lead to the strengthening of a culture of prevention, contributing to the full development of the human being and living well.</p>
<p>In this sense, the environmental contents are not reduced to simple studies of the biotic and abiotic elements, but also with the multiple interrelationships between these elements and the social, economic, political and cultural aspects of the environment; where the socio-environmental problems related to comprehensive health, consumption and poverty that affect environmental quality and the social well-being of citizens originate.</p>
<p>Contemplating the new dynamics and goals that emerged within the framework of the SDG 2030, the Curricular Transformation process launched as a result of the National Consultation for Educational Quality (2015) incorporated as a fundamental guideline that in secondary education schools and the rest of the educational levels, programs dedicated to the preservation of the environment and risk prevention are organized, as well as the formation of volunteer ecological brigades for risk mitigation.

<h3>11.3.8. University Education Sector</h3>
<p>University Education, aware of the importance of knowledge about climate change, has been aligning itself from the academic sector in response to the need to make Venezuelan society aware of the problem of climate change.</p>
<p>The Cátedra Libre de Cambio Climático (CLCC), through the development of educational activities framed in the CMNCC, aspires to continue contributing to the construction of a society with greater awareness of the causes and consequences of climate change and to contribute to the control of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to contribute at the national level to the central objective of the current stage in the management of climate change in the world: the definition of adaptation measures that make society less vulnerable to the challenges imposed by climate change.</p >
<p>In the same way, Venezuelan University Education institutions have implemented socio-environmental training actions, offering subjects directly or indirectly related to the environment within their programming. In some cases, they introduce the subject of Environmental Education as a compulsory subject within the introductory courses, before starting the professional cycles.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Venezuelan State has founded Institutions of University Education throughout the country, achieving in this way that university education will cease to be a privilege of few to be a right of all Venezuelans; Some of these institutions offer training in the environmental area, at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, with the purpose of developing responsible environmental management.</p>
<p>In this sense, the environment involves the natural and the sociocultural in all its dimensions and manifestations; with diversity as a fundamental principle and is one of the privileged areas where the priority areas of attention converge with greater relevance.</p>
<p>For the new University, the environment demands to be considered within the framework of organizational and curricular changes that make possible the opening of new paths oriented towards the conjunction of scientific-technological processes; also including the integral assessment of the human being as a transforming agent of his reality through his knowledge and his actions.

<p>11.3.9. Gender Sector (Women and Gender Equality)</p>
<p>The political participation of women in Venezuela, since the end of the 20th century, has become evident in the occupation of a greater number of women in institutional positions, ministries and collective organizations, the aforementioned document also states that women have led four of the five public powers (all except the Executive). Five out of six directors of the Supreme Court of Justice are women, just as 14 of the 32 magistrates are women. Similarly, the number of women representatives in Venezuela has almost tripled in the last decade.</p>
<p>At the regional level, the participation of women in governorships, mayors' offices, and comptrollerships is equally evident. For such purposes, since 2009, the Ministry for Women of Venezuela, founded in 2008, under the direction of the National Institute for Women, acquired budgetary autonomy and its name changed to Ministry of Popular Power for Women and Gender Equity. in 2009, an institution that since its creation has been oriented towards promoting favorable policies for women. It is important to point out that it is recognized that the Venezuelan woman has managed to occupy a significant space in the national public sphere, however, equity is based on the principles of social justice and human rights where opportunities are offered to both men and women. women, instruments, access policies in an equitable manner, prevailing within that condition of equality, criteria according to gender needs.

<p>11.3.11. Mining Sector</p>
<p>A mining system is made up of a network of operators and institutions from the public and private sectors whose activities establish, execute, control, produce, transform and market mineral resources, in their pure state, after adding value and transformation into intermediate and final goods.</p>
<p>It is then a set of interrelated agents, institutions and practices that constitute, execute and participate in mining activity processes. In the case of the National Ecological Mining System, this is characterized by the incorporation of the vision of ecological mining; This statement derives from the proposal for an economic model to be developed by the Bolivarian Revolution, which states "the need to build an eco-socialist economic model, based on a harmonious relationship between human beings and nature", for which it is necessary “to ratify the defense of the sovereignty of the Venezuelan State over vital resources”.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vision of ecological mining development</p>
<p>The Ministry of Popular Power for Ecological Mining Development (MPPDME) is the governing body for mining activity in the country and the National Ecological Mining System, in charge of ensuring compliance with the political guidelines issued by the Bolivarian Government for the sovereign, ecological and efficient use and exploitation of mining resources, through the development of productive chains and added value within the mining sector at the scales of small, medium and large mining, based on ecological mining that allows us to overcome dependence on income oil company, generate sources of employment and a new stage of the sustainable national productive economy, without establishing a new mining rentism.</p>
<p>The challenge that is assumed with the formulation and subsequent concretion of this Mining Sector Plan, is to develop a mining that is capable of promoting and diversifying the country's economy, while maintaining a balance between the environment and the human being and thus be able to extract , transform and give added value to mineral resources, but under the maxim of rational control, which guarantees that minerals, ecosystems and biodiversity will be there for the use and enjoyment of future generations.</p>

<p>Actions, Policies, Measures and Strategies to be Implemented to Mitigate the Effects of Climate Change Derived from the Development of Mining Activity:</p>
<p>The construction and formulation of these proposals and guidelines to undertake measures in environmental matters were elaborated with the purpose of generating a comprehensive solution, in line with the aforementioned values of an Ecological Mining Management, for its adherence to the national document to be presented before the corresponding international instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compensatory Actions, Policies, Measures and Strategies to be Implemented:</p>
<p>Eco-mining technical provisions in the reforestation of areas affected by mining and related activity in the National Ecological Mining System: the existence of forested areas in Venezuela is a contribution to the mitigation of action against the climate, due to the fact that the vegetal layer helps to capture from the atmosphere the main greenhouse gas that is CO2, in this sense, the Ministry of Popular Power of</p>
<p>Desarrollo Minero Ecológico, through MISSION PIAR, is working hand in hand with MINEC, in order to identify and diagnose the impact of mining activity at different mining scales.</p>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela demonstrates its firm commitment, implementing a defined and coherent roadmap, to contribute to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Change Climate in relation to the Nationally Determined Contributions (CND). In the same way, the Ministry of Popular Power for Ecological Mining Development, in the mining sector has developed and executed plans in environmental matters applying eco-socialist productive economic models, based on our capacities and potential for adaptation to Climate Change and its effects.

<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is a country vulnerable to different natural phenomena, earthquakes, floods, mass movements, tropical storms and hurricanes, tsunamis and technological events, such as fires, explosions, spills and others. The record of historical events reflects that the highest incidence and impacts, 71% of them, occur as a result of events triggered by rain.</p>
<p>Disasters have usually been defined as “unexpected” situations that cause serious effects on the population of climate-related impacts, giving rise to the widespread confusion between the terms: “natural phenomenon” and “natural disaster”, therefore that the magnitude of damage and human losses associated with disasters that have occurred in Latin America in recent decades and the visualization of the multiple conditions of vulnerability of the affected sectors of the population, especially the poorest, has led experts to find a broader explanation of disasters, associating the degree of destruction and losses with the vulnerability of the population and the socio-natural construction of risk.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Office of the Vice Minister for Risk Management and Civil Protection was created and the Law for Comprehensive Management of Socionatural and Technological Risks was promulgated, promulgated according to the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No. 39,095 dated 09 January 2009.

<p>Climate Change represents a risk to human health, due to the increase in environmental health factors (physical, chemical and biological), for example: heavy rainfall and flooding, increased temperatures and relative humidity, favor the appearance of vectors and reservoirs of parasites or viruses that cause metaxenic diseases, contamination of water supply sources, affecting their quality, greenhouse gas emissions, among others.</p>
<p>The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela turns out to be highly vulnerable to the incidence of diseases produced by vectors that are sensitive to climatic changes, because it is located in the tropical zone. In this situation, the State maintains cutting-edge policies attached to the principles and methods of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), based on Integrated Vector Management, where local knowledge, risk microstratification, intersectorality and community participation converge in the management of control programs. prevention of metaxenic diseases.</p>
<p>The Ministry of People's Power for Health (MPPS), as rector in the monitoring and control of water quality for human consumption, works with prevention actions in diseases of water origin, to guarantee the quality of water, through periodic monitoring; likewise, the identification of incinerators located in the health sector, through national censuses, in order to know the conditions and establish technical guidelines on the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>Before the Bolivarian Revolution in 1999, more than 60% of the people who lived in popular sectors had never gone to a doctor for a general check-up. In 2015, it will be 12 years since the creation of Barrio Adentro, an unprecedented mission that allows access to high-tech health services free of charge to significant sectors of the population. Barrio Adentro is responsible for at least 704 million 958 thousand free medical consultations in the last 12 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barrio Adentro was created in 2003 with the help of the Cuban government, to offer health services to the Venezuelan population in small clinics built and equipped with medical supplies in previously neglected areas. Later, Barrio Adentro II was created to expand medical services, with the construction of larger clinics, and then in 2005 Barrio Adentro III, through which 600 comprehensive Diagnostic Centers and 600 comprehensive Rehabilitation Rooms were built. In 2006, Barrio Adentro IV began with the inauguration of specialized centers such as the Children's Cardiology Hospital in Caracas.</p>

<h3><a>11.3.15. Labor Sector (Social Justice)</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/convsp.pdf">Climate change</a> is one of the most important challenges that must be addressed in the coming years in the workplace, worldwide and therefore in Venezuela, the <a href="http://www.oit.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_098486 .pdf">International Labor Organization</a> (ILO), warns that the phenomenon is producing, in the short, medium or long term, a serious disruption of economic and social activity in many sectors on all continents.</ p>
<p>Latin America and the Caribbean are particularly exposed to the effects of climate change, among which the high vulnerability of some sectors such as: water, biodiversity, tourism, agricultural activities, forests and health stand out.</p>
<p>In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, environmental protection has a significant connotation and that is how the 1999 Constitution establishes Environmental Rights in Chapter IX and specifically in Article 127 states that:</p>
<p><i>“It is a right and a duty of each generation to protect and maintain the environment for the benefit of itself and the future world. Every person has the right individually and collectively to enjoy a safe, healthy and ecologically balanced life and environment. The State will protect the environment, biological diversity, genetic resources, ecological processes, national parks and natural monuments, and other areas of special ecological importance.</i></p>
<p>Similarly, it is highlighted in Article 128. "The State will develop a land management policy taking into account the ecological, geographical, population, social, cultural, economic, and political realities, in accordance with the premises of sustainable development, that includes information, consultation and citizen participation.”</p>
<p>This synergy of the commitment of the revolutionary Government with the protection of the environment is materialized in the Plan for the Homeland, since it establishes in the 5 Great Historical Objective called "Contribute to the preservation of life on the planet and the salvation of the human species", where the fundamental premise is not only to fight against climate change, but to advance in the development of an "ecosocialist doctrine" as a construction of harmonious ways of life and respect for the rights of the land and of all its inhabitants.</p>
<p>In order to comply with these legal precepts, today more than ever it is necessary to have a working and business class committed to ecology and the conservation of healthy work environments, which undertakes the fight towards the installation of new production models , with low greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>All work entities, regardless of their economic activity, are exposed to the effects of climate change, where serious consequences are evident in terms of direct and indirect job losses, in this sense, to address these effects, the organizations of workers and workers; (Workers Productive Committee (CPT), Prevention Delegates, Unions, Worker Councils, among others), must develop actions to mitigate and adapt to it.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, for the next few years, ecosocialism and employment must go hand in hand towards mitigation, adaptation and reduction of risks due to climate change, for which education, information and guidance on environmental matters is essential to try to reach higher levels of awareness in relation to this issue.</p>
<p>The objective situation that is pursued is to position in our country, in the discussion that has been taking place in the world, regarding the design of an environmentally responsible policy, whose purpose is to raise awareness of the human being in their levels of well-being and social equity , while significantly reducing environmental risks and damage to nature. We believe that our societies must change and that this transformation can only occur from a perspective of justice and social inclusion. Below is File 17 of the Labor Sector (Social Justice).</p>

<h3>11.3.17. Ecosystems Sector (Coastal Zone, Territorial Planning, Mountains, Wetlands)</h3>
<p>In the country, climate variability and the occurrence of extreme events have been more prone in recent years, in the same way it is difficult to forecast precise effects of climate change; However, recent studies warn about the potential impacts on humans due to floods, storms, droughts and heat waves, with predictions of a lack of drinking water and possible conflicts by increasing competition for water resources, as well as large changes in the conditions for food production.</p>
<p>Climate change has a clear impact on the supply of water, affecting ecosystems (in low-altitude areas, island areas, low-lying coastal areas, arid and semi-arid areas, areas exposed to flooding, drought and desertification, and areas with fragile mountain ecosystems) and agriculture.</p>
<p>This vulnerability has become evident in a series of emergencies and natural disasters with severe effects on housing, food production, electricity generation and biological diversity, among others.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, Venezuela has taken large-scale measures that have made it possible to care for and protect the affected population, promote the resilience processes of ecosystems considered strategic for the conservation of biological diversity and the generation of sustainable socio-productive processes. or environmentally responsible, reduce damage and reduce the vulnerability of the Nation to Climate Change.

This is how the implementation of this plan generates a decrease in the vulnerability of the population and socio-productive activities in the processes of spatial occupation in the face of Climate Change in the next 20 years, especially when contemplating within its conception the variable risk and participation of the Popular Power organizations.</p>
<p>2. Planning Plan and Integrated Management of Coastal Zones (POGIZC) of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela:</p>
<p>The POGIZC is in the final evaluation process for its subsequent approval by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, however, since its preparation it has become the spatial and temporal reference framework that guarantees the conservation, the sustainable use and exploitation of coastal areas and allows raising the quality of life of its inhabitants, being the same a fundamental contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). To this end, it defines 10 Programs for the Integrated Management of Coastal Zones:</p>
<p>The POGIZC has served as the basis for the generation of a series of relevant technical documents to support decision-making in matters of adaptation to Climate Change:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Policies Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Coastal Zones of Venezuela (2010).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implications of Climate Change in the Coastal Zones and the Aquatic Area of Venezuela (2011).</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Reactivation and active participation in various spaces for the creation of Alliances (2018 - Current): Redparques, Ramsar Convention, UNDP, UNEP, WCPA, GEF, PPD, Inparques, Mintur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Orinoco Oil Belt Land Management Plan Project "Hugo Chávez Frías" (National Strategic Development Zone - ZDEN):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This draft Decree will be submitted to a Public Consultation process, after having been built collectively with the institutions and other key actors in the Zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a regional planning instrument that guides development based on the country's main industry, which is oil, in harmony with other economic-productive sectors of the Nation under an environmentally responsible approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By identifying threats, especially those of a technological nature, research programs and monitoring of industrial processes are proposed within the framework of the plan, particularly those that could increase Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.</ p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Areas Under the Special Administration Regime (ABRAE) and their Management Plans and Use Regulations (PORU):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Territory management instruments that identify areas of strategic value for the country in terms of Preservation, Protection, Production and Geostrategic actions, for which planning units are identified and uses and activities are established according to their objectives of creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, work is being done to reach the Ecosocialist Agenda of the "Plan 200 Carabobo", instructed by the Citizen President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in which the presentation of a group of instruments for ordering of the territory, among which stand out the declaration of new National Parks and other categories of Areas Under Special Administration Regime (ABRAE), as well as the adjustment in the polygons and the updating of Management Plans and Use Regulations (PORU), Estimating a number that can exceed 20 cases that includes National Parks, Natural Monuments, Wildlife Reserves, Protected Zones and the novelty of the declaration of Special Aquatic Habitats, the latter promoting Sustainable Development Goal 14, Life Underwater.</ p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. State Land Management Plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Following the hierarchical system of territorial planning instruments, six (6) plans of federal entities have been addressed considering the risk variable for the analyzes and assignments of use, among which the states are approved: Falcón (2004 in the process of updating), Táchira (2005), Barinas (2011), Cojedes (2011), Miranda (2011), Trujillo (2017) and without approving the corresponding to the state of La Guaira and Sucre (2019 - 2020)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating the risk variable in the rest of the State Land Management Plans, as well as those generated at the municipal, urban, local and community level will reduce the vulnerability of the population and its socio-productive activities in the face of Climate Change </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Actions and programs with an impact on adaptation or mitigation of Climate Change and its effects:</p>
<p>6. Soil Conservation, Desertification and Drought:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since the 80s of the last century, Venezuela has identified the need and importance of soil conservation to address the issue of agri-food security, and in recent times as part of the contribution to address related issues to Climate Change, since the increase in the organic content of soils mitigates this process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this sense, the Ministry of People's Power for Ecosocialism, within the framework of the National Action Program to Combat Desertification and Drought Mitigation, has revitalized soil management and conservation policies, through guidelines for the preservation, reduction, rehabilitation or recovery of land degradation, through the approach of sustainable development within the framework of a humanistic and self-managed economy, a supportive and equitable social environment and participatory democracy from the ecosocialist approach, in accordance with the guidelines of national development as well as community socio-environmental conditions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This instrument is structured into 5 Strategic Lines, namely: sustainable development of areas affected by processes leading to desertification and the effects of drought; Education, training and awareness as fundamental elements of development; scientific research and technological innovation, as the foundation of scientifically argued local development; Institutional Strengthening; and Intra and International Cooperation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was determined in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, goal 15.3, its Indicator 15.3.1 "Proportion of degraded land in relation to the total land area", with its three sub-indicators 1) Land Cover (Trends in land use / land cover); 2) Land Productivity (Trend of Land Productivity); and 3) Soil Organic Carbon (carbon stock on the surface and in the soil). Establishing the Land Degradation Neutrality (NDT) Working Group, which, with the participation of researchers, academics and other key stakeholders, was validated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Drought Strategy was prepared, which identifies the vulnerability to extreme drought events in the various productive sectors of the country (Agriculture, Water, Socio-Economic, Electricity, Hydrocarbons, and Environmental), as well as the national development objectives set out in the Plan de Patria Law 2019 - 2025 by Development Goals. Determining the national strengths to face it. It was prepared with the participation of more than 150 people, coming from national and international scientific, educational institutions, and environmental movements, who represented about 32 national organizations including ministries, organizations, universities, and research centers, as well as the presence of authorities national and international.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formulation of the proposed Action Program with Perspective and Gender Equity in the Fight Against Desertification and Drought in synergy with Climate Change and Biological Diversity, with the purpose of identifying strategies that contribute to leading participation in decision-making in attention to environmental problems; and provide capacity building, among others, which will therefore have a positive impact on lifestyles, benefiting the Venezuelan population in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The document called Dry Zones of Venezuela: Area and Population is being prepared, which is based on:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, among the achievements of its implementation, the following stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internationally, there is a perception that Venezuela does not have dry lands, because it is within the tropical zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was unknown how many drylands, at a national level, Venezuela has and how many people live in these spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification requested member countries to quantify drylands with arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid climates (according to Thornthwaite).</p>
<p>The need to spatialize and direct the efforts indicated within the National Drought Strategy (MINEC, 2019).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>7. National Policies for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of Coastal Zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Article 23 of the Decree with Force of Law on Coastal Zones (2001) states: "In coastal zones, the National Public Power is responsible for: Formulating conservation and sustainable development policies...". Likewise, the Third Transitory Provision establishes: "Within a period of one (1) year, counted from the publication of this Decree Law in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources should submit for consideration by the Council of Ministers, the national policies for conservation and sustainable development of coastal areas...”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In response to this, the Ministry of Popular Power for the Environment, currently the Ministry of Popular Power for Ecosocialism, developed the proposal for National Policies for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of Coastal Zones (RBV - MINAMB, 2010).</p >
</li>
<li>
<p>These are the result of the articulation of the contents of the state documents for the Integrated Management of Coastal Zones (Phases I and II). The environmental problems identified by the Working Committees of the Coastal Zones at the State Level (CTZCNE) were taken as a starting point for its elaboration, which allowed the construction of the document of National Policies for Conservation and Sustainable Development of Coastal Zones from local and regional management levels up to the national level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The construction of the proposal became an interesting exercise of confrontation of the current problems of the coastal zones and their solution options, with the guidelines, directives and actions contained in the Decree with Force of Law of Coastal Zones, to reach conclusions about the validity and relevance of the latter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Policies for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of Coastal Zones represent the guidelines for implementing and executing a dynamic process for strengthening institutional capacity, optimizing planning, and coordinating competencies for the integrated management of this space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the National Policies for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of Coastal Zones is to establish the provisions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Give priority attention to environmental problems identified in coastal areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote the protection of coastal zones and rehabilitate degraded areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide actions in decision-making, regarding the development prospects for the coastal areas of Venezuela.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer an adequate frame of reference to support the development of Planning and Integrated Management Plans for Coastal Zones at different scales.</p>
</li>

<h3>11.3.18. Biodiversity Sector (Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity)</h3>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Climate change has a clear impact on biodiversity. This is constituted as a threat to individuals, species and ecosystems; on the other hand, the affectations of biodiversity can alter the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and their interactions with biological, geochemical and hydrological cycles (IPCC, 2007).</p>
<p>A determining factor is any natural or anthropogenic factor that causes, directly or indirectly, a change in an ecosystem or in biodiversity. In those that influence explicitly they are direct determinants. Among them are changes in land use, climate change, the presence of invasive species, the overexploitation of natural resources and pollution.</p>
<p>It should be noted that indirect determinants operate in a diffuse manner, affecting one or several determinants. Among the indirect factors that affect biodiversity are changes in human populations, changes in economic activity, demographic, socio-political, cultural and religious changes; and scientific and technological change (MEA, 2005).</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has taken large-scale measures that have made it possible to care for and protect the affected population, reduce damage, and reduce vulnerability.

<p>1. Holding of workshops on review and evaluation of the implementation of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity 2010-2020 (ENCDB). Within the framework of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity 2010 - 2020 (ENCDB) and its National Action Plan (PAN), among the actions that contribute to minimizing the effects of climate change is keeping ecosystems in good working order. of the country, which includes conserving the wild populations of the fauna and flora species that inhabit them, as well as their habitats. The programs for the conservation of endangered species and the sustainable use of biological diversity that MINEC has been developing through the General Directorate of Biological Diversity have the objective of protecting, conserving and reinforcing the populations of species of wild fauna and flora, in order to to increase the population abundance of these species, for which in situ and ex situ conservation actions are carried out. This is how it counts with:</p>
<p>National Program for the Conservation of Threatened Species Conservation of Continental Turtles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conservation of Sea Turtles (Dermochelys coriacea, Chelonia mydas, Eretmochelys imbricata, Caretta caretta and Lepidochelys olivácea).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservation of the Arrau Tortoise (Podocnemis expansa) and other continental turtles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservation of the Orinoco Caiman (Crocodylus intermedius)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservation of the Caracas Walnut (Juglans venezuelensis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservation of non-timber flora species (moss, orchids, bromeliads, mangroves, morichales, among others).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>National Program for the Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use of slime (Caiman crocodilus).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Chigüire (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Parrots.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the Caracas Walnut (Juglans venezuelensis) Conservation Program, an endemic species of the Coastal Range, developed by the Ministry of People's Power for Ecosocialism (MINEC), through the General Directorate of Biological Diversity, With the participation of Misión Árbol and the National Parks Institute (INPARQUES), in the period 2017-2020, approximately 500 specimens of this species were planted, cultivated in institutional nurseries of MINEC, INPARQUES, CONARE and Misión Árbol , in order to reinforce the natural populations in the Waraira Repano National Park, also increasing the vegetation cover and thus contributing to the mitigation of Climate Change.</p>
<p>It is estimated that from 2017 to 2020, the development and implementation of these programs for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, at the national level, have contributed 5% to the minimization of vulnerability to the adverse effects of Change Climate. However, to strengthen these programs, personnel and financing are required to monitor the conservation and sustainable use of wild flora and fauna species, specifically with regard to population studies of the species of interest and their contribution to the adaptation and mitigation to climate change.</p>
<p>How many training workshops were held in the period 2017 -2020?</p>
<p>In 2017-2020, the General Directorate of Biological Diversity held 25 training workshops for officials, communities, students and teachers, within the framework of the conservation of biological diversity, within the framework of compliance with international commitments and one on adaptation to climate change within the framework of the ecosocialist week against climate change. It is planned to carry out a series of training workshops on the conservation of biological diversity with a focus on Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change for the period 2021 - 2030. For this, the participation of professionals and technicians specialized in Climate Change and funding to teach these courses.</p>
<p>1. Program for the release of specimens of threatened species.</p>
<p>During the period 2017 -2020, 834 specimens of Orinoco caiman, 57,780 sea turtles (including cardon, hawksbill and loggerhead turtles) and 83,054 specimens of Arrau turtle were released in their distribution areas. Supporting the strengthening and conservation of their natural populations.</p>
<p>1. Methodology established for the release and obtain expected results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monitoring and safeguarding of the reproductive season of threatened or endangered wild species, in priority breeding areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captive breeding of specimens from priority breeding areas, for a period of one year until they reach a suitable size that makes their release into the wild feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release into their natural distribution area of specimens of wild species threatened or in danger of extinction, coming from priority breeding areas, from captive breeding or rehabilitated in rescue centers and zoos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Censuses of the populations of threatened or endangered species with specimen release programs to measure their effectiveness in the recovery of these populations. In terms of carrying out censuses, it has been hampered by a lack of technical personnel, as well as financial resources to carry out follow-up, specifically with regard to population studies of these species.</p>

<h3>12. SUPPORT AND IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen and continue promoting policies and the implementation of prioritized actions in terms of adaptation and mitigation to Climate Change, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela requires sufficient financial resources, as well as technical assistance and technology transfer aimed at fighting climate change. Climate Change and its effects, as well as to increase the resilience of its natural and human systems.</p>
<p>Access to climate financing represents a challenge for the country, which is currently subjected to the cruelest Unilateral Coercive Measures (MCU) that violate the fundamental Human Rights of the population. Said financing is considered important for the achievement of the objectives of this CND and to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Updated CND projects challenges in terms of financing, technical, technological, scientific capacities, institutional and governance transformation. Although there are initiatives and alliances in the country between the different institutions of the public and private sectors, academia and non-governmental organizations, capacity building and access to non-reimbursable financial resources from international cooperation are required for compliance.</ p>
<p>It is important to point out that an assessment of support and implementation needs is required in accordance with the guidelines and methodologies, which allow quantifying the needs for the execution of adaptation and mitigation measures to climate change framed in the Paris Agreement and in the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>Some of the barriers and challenges for Venezuela, in relation to the implementation of adaptation, mitigation and losses and damages due to climate change revolve around implementation at the sectoral, territorial and local level, among which the following stand out:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Update the legal framework to integrate climate change into future development planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the available climate projections and low territorial coverage related to the analysis of vulnerability to the effects of climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand training and capacities to develop climate risk analysis (under the conceptual and methodological framework of the IPCC) at the sectorial, territorial and local level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update information on the impacts of climate change on the marine-coastal region, mountain areas, and the country's biological diversity, among others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>ANNEX: PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (CND)</h3>
<p>The update of the Nationally Determined Contribution (CND) of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was carried out through a broad, systematic and multisectoral participatory process for the joint construction and validation of sectoral commitments, Led by MINEC through the General Directorate for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, as Technical Focal Point before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p>In order to ensure the participation of all the key sectors of Venezuela in the update of the second CND, the MINEC designed an action plan with execution activities in the years 2020-2021; carrying out the following actions, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Workshop was held in the context of unilateral coercive measures and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, Coronavirus type 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome) or COVID 19, represent for Venezuela to respond in this context to the commitments assumed for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adaptation to climate change, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inter-institutional coordination and articulation with the different sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inter-institutional link was established for the collection of information and interaction with each sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>26 work meetings were established with external sectors and 11 work meetings with the internal substantive Directorates of Minec, which allowed a thorough review of the needs and barriers to be overcome for the implementation of the CNDs. It is important to note that, in compliance with the mobility and biosafety restriction measures due to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the sessions were mostly held online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raising the CNDs in the different sectors and advancing in their implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process was coordinated by the Management team of the General Directorate for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation as speakers/facilitators, and had the methodological support and guidance derived from international forums and workshops in which our country in virtual mode.</p>
<p>The collaborative work consisted of: (1) bibliographic review and analysis of political and national development priorities; (2) preliminary preparation of possible commitments on climate change and their prioritization; (3) successive work meetings of the technical teams until a consensus is reached regarding the scope, structure, follow-up mechanisms, among other operational aspects of each commitment; (4) various consultations via telephone, email, via zoom for each sector to expand actions to address the climate crisis; (5) space for socialization and feedback through meetings; (6) technical-political approval process for all parties involved. The photographic record of the meetings held to prepare the update of the CND by its acronym in English of the Country is detailed below.</p>
