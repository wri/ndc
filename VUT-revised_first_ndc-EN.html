  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Vanuatu submits this updated and enhanced nationally determined contribution (NDC), in which our political leaders, technical experts and civil society have considered how our nation can move to a global net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions society (Article 4.1) whilst being resilient to the unavoidable impacts of climate change (Article 7.1), minimising, averting and addressing loss and damage (Article 8) in the context of the long-term temperature goal (Article 2), while determining our financial needs (Article 9) that shall be provided by developed country Parties in continuation of their existing obligations under the UNFCCC.</p>
  <p>Vanuatu is already a carbon-negative country. With forests covering 70% of its islands, and its maritime jurisdiction comprising 98% of the nation, the big ocean state of Vanuatu is already a carbon sink - absorbing more carbon dioxide than it produces - thus freely providing a critical environmental service to carbon emitting countries around the world. Moving beyond our current Net Zero status, this NDC recommits Vanuatu to rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, deeply decarbonising and transitioning completely to a circular economy.</p>
  <p>Pursuant to Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, and to demonstrate that Vanuatu is an action-focused leader in its calls for all Parties to make ambitious commitments to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, Vanuatu’s NDC reflects the highest ambitions on adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage. As per Decision 4/CMA.1, Vanuatu’s information provides clarity, transparency and understanding.</p>
  <p>This updated and enhanced NDC contains 20 Mitigation commitments, 116 Adaptation commitments, 12 Loss & Damage commitments and is based on the ambitions, policies and workplans of Vanuatu's frontline sector agencies.</p>
  <p>Targets and commitments are conditional upon international finance, action, support, technology and capacity development. The approximate conditional cost of achieving Vanuatu’s Revised and Enhanced NDC is USD 1,214,350,000.</p>
  <h3>Vanuatu’s Science-Based Commitments</h3>
  <p>The international climate regime, including the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, is built upon a clear understanding of the threats posed by, and the causes of, climate change. More than a century and a half of industrialisation, along with the clear-felling of forests and certain farming methods, has led to increased quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>The Paris Agreement set out a global commitment to limiting warming to well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Vanuatu bases its nationally determined commitments on the best available science, which confirms the existential nature of the current climate crisis and the urgency with which we, and all nations, must act.</p>
  <p>The Republic of Vanuatu signed the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 21 September 2016. The Government of the Republic of Vanuatu is fully committed to effective and transparent implementation of the Agreement and submitted its declaration, which reads, in part:</p>
  <p>“…the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu declares that, in light of the best scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts, it considers the emission reduction obligations in Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol, the Doha Amendment and the aforesaid Paris Agreement to be inadequate to prevent global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial levels and as a consequence, will have severe implications for our national interests...”</p>
  <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that to limit global warming to 1.5°C, global emissions need to be roughly halved by around 2030 (compared to 2018) and reach net zero around 2050. Net zero refers to the situation in which emissions reduce to almost zero, and any remaining emissions are removed from the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>The IPCC AR6 report suggests that under all scenarios examined, Earth is likely to reach the crucial 1.5º warming limit in the early 2030s unless deep cuts are made to CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change and its consequences are already being felt. Beyond 1.5º, the situation will rapidly deteriorate.. This expected increase of the global mean temperature is associated with rising sea levels, rapidly changing ecosystems and more extreme and slow-onset events such as heat waves, storms and flooding. The impacts undermine global efforts for development and prosperity everywhere, and particularly in small island developing states like Vanuatu.</p>
  <h3>Long Term Vision on Climate Change</h3>
  <p>The Republic of Vanuatu’s long term vision on climate change and aspirations are embedded within the fundamental duties defined under its constitution: “to protect the Republic of Vanuatu and to safeguard the national wealth, resources and environment in the interests of the present generation and of future generations” and guided by its National Vision - “A stable, sustainable and prosperous Vanuatu”, under the National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2016–2030 also called Vanuatu 2030: The People’s Plan.</p>
  <p>The Republic of Vanuatu’s long-term climate action vision is governed by the Vanuatu Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy 2016-2030 (CCDRR Policy – to promote good governance and establishes priorities and strategies for future climate actions; and Meteorology, Geological Hazards and Climate Change Act No. 25 of 2016 (Climate Change Act), that provides institutions (governance and administrative provisions), transparency and roles and responsibility for departments of meteorology, geological hazards and climate change and for related purposes.</p>
  <p>In May 2022, the Parliament of the Republic of Vanuatu Declared a Climate Emergency, reaffirming that climate change is the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of the peoples of Vanuatu, and decided to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Respond to the climate emergency in ways that emphasize equity, self-determination, culture, tradition, democracy, and the protection of fundamental human rights.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Submit a new and enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution which demonstrates global highest levels of ambition with targets on Vanuatu’s sector priorities in adaptation and loss & damage.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pursue all suitable avenues under international and domestic law to prevent harm resulting from climate change, including protecting the rights of present and future generations, including, by seeking an Advisory Opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States under international law to protect the rights of present and future generations against the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Further engage the public and civil society in climate-emergency and climate justice related deliberations.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>NDC Enhancement</h3>
  <p>Pursuant to Articles 4.2 and 4.11 of the PA and Decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 23, the Republic of Vanuatu, taking into account its national circumstances and capabilities, hereby communicates its revised and further enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution under the agreement for 2021–2030. The Government of the Republic of Vanuatu notes with great concern that the objective of the agreement can only be achieved by intensifying the level of action significantly, complemented by international support, to achieve conditional contributions, as reflected in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).</p>
  <p>In that spirit, the Republic of Vanuatu presents its enhanced NDC for 2021–2030 and calls on all Parties to increase their ambitions in line with the best available and most recent science and obligations under the Agreement.</p>

  <h2>Mitigation Contribution</h2>
  <h3>Vanuatu’s INDC 2016 (Mitigation)</h3>
  <p>Vanuatu submitted its initial NDC to the UNFCCC on 21st September 2016. The main mitigation contribution under the initial submission was to achieve the outcomes and targets under the National Energy Road Map (NERM) and Second National Communication (SNC) extended to 2030. The mitigation contribution for the Vanuatu INDC submission was a sector specific target of transitioning to close to 100% renewable energy in the electricity sector by 2030. This target would replace nearly all fossil fuel requirements for electricity generation in the country and be consistent with the National Energy Road Map (NERM) target of 65% renewable energy by 2020. This contribution would reduce emissions in the energy sector by 72Gg by 2030. Emissions in this sector were around 130 Gg in 2010 but are expected to rise to 240 Gg by 2030 (3% per annum). Vanuatu’s INDC mitigation contribution would thus reduce business as usual (BAU) emissions in the electricity sub-sector by 100% and in the energy sector by 30%. The target was conditional, depending on funding commensurate with putting the transition in place being made available from external sources. In addition, the transition to renewable energy-based electricity could be accelerated through the review of agricultural (coconut oil sector) national policy. Opportunities for reducing the high emissions levels in agriculture were to be simultaneously pursued through cooperative programmes with nations having similarly high emissions in this sector. The forestry sector mitigation was to be treated as part of the existing REDD+ programme. The Government was also aware that waste management required further attention.</p>

It is to be noted that GHG mitigation potentials for some of the measures identified for the waste sector are not estimated due to lack of data or methodology. However, the cumulative impact of the additional measures will result in higher GHG emissions reductions from waste sector.</p>

  <h2>Adaptation Contribution</h2>
  <h3>Vanuatu Enhanced NDC (Adaptation)</h3>
  <p>Vanuatu has prioritised transformative adaptation action in its National Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy, with a strategic goal of resilient development, including implementing activities that enable Vanuatu to absorb and quickly bounce back from climate shocks and stresses.</p>
  <p>The following Adaptation Targets have been defined in an inclusive, participatory and decentralised way by the sectors that are themselves implementing and planning for a resilient future. For each target, the specific policy reference is provided, as well as the link to Vanuatu’s National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP), the most relevant Global Sustainable Development Goal (SGD), the level of conditionality of finance required from developed country Parties, and the overall financial envelope to successfully meet the target by 2030.</p>
  <p><strong>AGRICULTURE</strong></p>
  <p>Sixty per cent (60%) of Vanuatu’s population relies on agriculture as the basis of household incomes and livelihoods, and it accounts for around 23% of GDP. Much agriculture activity is micro-scale subsistence, for household consumption or sale at local markets, and dependent on rainfall, making the sector extremely vulnerable to climate impacts, loss and damage. Adaptation in the agriculture sector is one of the government’s highest priorities, with a goal of agriculture’s ability to support household income and food needs in a changing climate.</p>

  <p><strong>BIOSECURITY</strong></p>
  <p>In the context of a changing climate, Vanuatu must continue to protect its borders against the introduction and spread of foreign pests and diseases that could affect crops, animals, humans and the environment, and, to enhance trade of Vanuatu’s products. Biosecurity is crucial to maintain good health, wellbeing and progress in the life of our climate resilient community. The increased impact of pest damage to crops and the environment due to climate change poses a great threat to the livelihood of Vanuatu citizens.</p>

  <p><strong>FISHERIES</strong></p>
  <p>Vanuatu recognises the severe adverse impacts of climate change on Vanuatu fisheries and marine ecosystems and the need for the fisheries sector to urgently adapt and address the loss and damage from climate-related disasters. 61% of households in Vanuatu regularly go fishing. The direct and indirect effects of climate change are expected to reduce the productivity of coastal fisheries in Vanuatu by 20– 50% by 2100.</p>

  <p><strong>FORESTRY</strong></p>
  <p>Impacts of climate change on the people and forests of Vanuatu are diverse and cross-sectoral, including inundation of forested land in low-lying areas, increased incidence of pests and diseases, prolonged periods of drought and flood conditions, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, salinisation of forested land close to the coasts and the penetration of saltwater into the subterranean freshwater resources, adversely affecting forests and trees. Changing temperature and precipitation regimes are influencing the productivity of forested land and require the adaptation or introduction of new trees and silvicultural production systems. The combined impacts of climate change, population growth and soil fertility declines will exert a growing and cumulative pressure on the remaining lowland forests of Vanuatu to be converted to agricultural land. On the other hand, Vanuatu’s forests offer opportunities for climate change mitigation through carbon conservation (SFM, protected areas, reducing of deforestation and forest degradation), carbon sequestration (afforestation and reforestation), and carbon substitution (replacement of carbon intensive products and fuels through wood products).</p>

  <p><strong>LIVESTOCK</strong></p>
  <p>Vanuatu requires a livestock sector that is modern, sustainably managed to benefit all its stakeholders, contributes to greater socio-economic development, and ensures sound environmental and climate resilience practices. Despite successes on climate change adaptation, farmers do not yet have sufficient knowledge or skills on breeds, farming systems or other methods to cope with the negative impacts of climate change. All too often animals become the victim of environmental disasters and adverse climatic conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>WATER</strong></p>
  <p>Vanuatu recognises that Climate Change vulnerability significantly impacts the safety, security and availability of water; and so aims to strengthen coordination with other sectors and partners to understand, predict, design and invest to secure Vanuatu’s water future. Currently, limited freshwater is available due to small water catchments. Some of the most profound impacts of climate variability and change will be felt in the water sector, particularly in water scarce areas and small islands that depend entirely on rainwater. In Vanuatu, both ground and surface water are used for domestic purposes. In urban areas the main water source is shallow aquifers whereas in rural areas various sources are used such as bores, wells, springs, rivers and rainwater catchments.</p>

  <p><strong>HEALTH</strong></p>
  <p>Vanuatu, like other countries in the region, faces a “triple health burden”: communicable diseases such as dengue, combined with increasing rates of non-communicable diseases and the effects of climate change. Vanuatu is vulnerable to climate change natural disasters which create public health emergencies, such as water and food contamination and other emerging diseases. Climate change related events will continue to threaten Vanuatu with the potential to impact on health service planning and delivery.</p>

  <p><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>
  <p>The key challenge facing Vanuatu in the context of environmental management and development planning is climate change. Vanuatu’s diverse ecosystems are being threatened by climate change as are the livelihoods and wellbeing of the ni-Vanuatu people who rely on them for income and food. Ecosystems provide cost- effective adaptation services, and effective natural resource management can minimise the risks of climate change and disasters while enhancing livelihoods resilience. Vanuatu’s environmental goals include climate resilience and nature-based solutions to achieve a strong and resilient nation in the face of climate change and disaster risks. The focus of Vanuatu’s conservation efforts is on the needs and interests of people, including resilience to climate change. Climate change related loss of biodiversity affects the livelihoods of rural and urban populations. In Vanuatu, biodiversity is our food, our culture, our tradition, our money, our medicine, our shelter, our fresh air (oxygen), our firewood, our coastline stabiliser, our protector against storm surge, protector of our freshwater systems, our carbon sequestration sink and our ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change. Our biodiversity is vital for our survival.</p>

  <p>Vanuatu is a Big Ocean State. Planning and management for use of marine resources, particularly living marine resources, must be able to respond to considerable climate uncertainty. Beyond planning for uncertainty, understanding the impacts and effects of climate change and other stressors, such as cyclones, coastal flooding, is also key to maintaining a healthy environment. This will influence how we use and value our coasts and seas both now and in the future. Adaptation of management, including in the marine environment, is necessary to deal with the potential impacts of these changes, many of which are already in train.</p>

  <p>WASTE</p>
  <p>Vanuatu has uniquely fragile marine, aquatic and terrestrial resources due to its size, lack of natural storage, competing land uses and vulnerability to climate change. Pollution due to settlements and other developments can have a significant impact on public health, quality of life, the environment and on economic development. The main types of pollutants threatening Vanuatu include increased loads of nutrients, sediments and pesticides in sewage and storm water runoff and in agricultural runoff. Climate change is putting further pressure on natural resources, threatening the long-term viability of communities and islands.</p>

  <p>Increasing access to ICTs for Vanuatu citizens is transforming government services and public administration, as well as supercharging advances in the socio-economic development of the nation and its resilience to climate change. While there are risks and downsides of the increased use of and dependence on ICTs, the country is working to empower users with tools and services, and enhancing relevance of ICTs by promoting the availability of local content and through capacity building programmes. ICTs unleash creative collaborations and climate-focused actions of various public and private entities, academia, civil society and the public in general, especially through online platforms for multi-stakeholder and multi-sector coordination and collaboration.</p>

  <p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></p>
  <p>Infrastructure is the foundation for climate resilient development in urban and rural areas, operating industries and commerce, improving living standards, delivering community services and driving economic growth. Vanuatu has made substantial progress in providing infrastructure, and planning for further investment is underway in individual sub-sectors. However, the current stock of Government of Vanuatu (GoV) supported infrastructure assets remains compromised by climate change, despite recent climate proofing efforts, due primarily to inadequate resources for operation and maintenance once they are deployed. As climate extremes become more intense and change in frequency, there are ever more critical challenges for developing public infrastructure in Vanuatu, particularly in remote outer islands.</p>

  <p><strong>PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</strong></p>
  <p>Planning for disaster risk reduction and climate change resilience must include persons with disabilities at the national, provincial and community levels. Evidence from Vanuatu indicates that persons with disabilities experience greater risk in a disaster. They are less likely to evacuate safely and without injury due to a lack of accessible information regarding evacuation processes, and limited availability of accessible evacuation shelters. Persons with disabilities are not always included adequately in community or national disaster risk reduction planning and response processes or structures such as Community Disaster and Climate Change Committees, and Clusters.</p>

  <p><strong>GENDER AND SOCIAL INCLUSION</strong></p>
  <p>Climate vulnerability and its consequences not only reflect existing gender inequality, they also reinforce and exacerbate socially constructed relations of power, norms, and practices that constrain progress toward gender equality in Vanuatu. This includes culturally influenced gender roles and responsibilities that confine women’s activities and mobility to the home; traditions that limit women’s access to natural, financial, and social capital, and thus their ability to cope with climate shocks and to adapt to climate change; and norms that inhibit women’s ability to access information, knowledge, skills, and capacity building that could be lifesaving during and after a weather-related disaster. As a result, women and girls in Vanuatu experience heightened social, economic, and health impacts of climate change. More women than men (49% and 41% respectively) are involved in the subsistence economy in Vanuatu, which makes them more susceptible to climate change, disasters and other livelihood stresses.</p>
  <p>When age is added to considerations of gender - that is, if the focus is specifically on girls - there is another layer of vulnerability and impact through which climate change intersects. After climate events, adolescent girls are at additional risk of being pulled out of school to help alleviate extra domestic burdens, like fetching water, that are shouldered by women in households under climate-related stress. Leaving school also makes girls less likely to be informed about climate change and further increases their vulnerability. Such circumstances put into play the early onset of key life transitions, including early pregnancy, that function to direct girls into a cycle of intergenerational poverty, vulnerability, and marginalisation.</p>
  <p>Despite the potential for exacerbated vulnerability, women and girls are highly impactful agents of change in Vanuatu, holding important traditional decision-making roles in their families, communities and schools. Women and girls have unique abilities as drivers of solutions when they are empowered, as men and women have different coping mechanisms, capacities and experiences in the face of climate change. Women and girls play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation because of their roles in core climate change sectors: agriculture, livestock management, energy, disaster risk reduction (DRR), forestry, water management and health. Increasingly, women are entering, but still under-represented in, renewable energy and mitigation activities in Vanuatu. Women’s local and environmental knowledge and survival strategies are major ingredients for recovery and resilience.</p>
  <p>Based on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is evident that people who are already most vulnerable and marginalised will experience the greatest impacts of climate change. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual and ally (LGBTQIA+) community is one such group, which, because of its social vulnerability, is a hidden victim of climate change to a wide extent. LGBTQIA+ individuals are uniquely vulnerable to exclusion, violence and exploitation because of the cumulative impacts of social stigma, discrimination and hatred. The social stigma around the LGBTQIA+ community also makes several social opportunities and infrastructure unavailable to them. The roots of climate change are tied with the roots of multiple oppressions.</p>

  <p><strong>HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE JUSTICE</strong></p>
  <p>Climate change can and does have differing social, economic, public health, and other adverse impacts on underprivileged populations. Global warming is an ethical and political issue, not purely environmental or physical in nature. In Vanuatu, the government recognises the need to relate the causes and effects of climate change to concepts of environmental justice and social justice. There are real concerns about the inequitable outcomes for different people and places associated with vulnerability to climate impacts, loss and damage. Climate change is fundamentally an issue of human rights that connects the local to national to the global, with those who are most affected having contributed least to climate change. Climate change is one of the greatest threats to human rights of our generation, posing a serious risk to the fundamental rights to life, health, food and an adequate standard of living of individuals and communities across Vanuatu.</p>

  <p><strong>INDIGENOUS PEOPLE</strong></p>
  <p>Vanuatu’s hundreds of unique indigenous cultures manage livelihood risks in a changing climate with traditional knowledge and solutions that deserve greater attention and consideration within national and global climate action arenas. Vanuatu’s indigenous peoples’ traditional ecological knowledge is based on a life lived in marginal and challenging environments, already implementing mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage strategies as part of traditional natural resources management.</p>
  <p>Climate induced loss and damage threatens the survival of this traditional knowledge, and destroys records relating to personal identification, ownership of assets and land. Traditional knowledge is the practices, systems, skills and “know-how” developed by a community and passed on from one generation to another, forming part of the spiritual and cultural identity of the group.</p>

  <p><strong>YOUTH</strong></p>
  <p>Children and future generations are bearing, and will continue to bear, the brunt of the impact on a polluted, degraded planet. Climate change and its effects on ni-Vanuatu youth is fast becoming a critical issue. Some of the leading killers of children worldwide are highly sensitive to climate change. Higher temperatures have been linked to increased rates of malnutrition, cholera, diarrhoeal disease and vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria. Children’s underdeveloped immune systems put them at far greater risk of contracting these diseases and succumbing to their complications. Additionally, the loss of a parent or home due to a climate change-induced natural disaster certainly changes a child’s world but it also can jeopardise their development.</p>

  <p>COLLABORATION</p>
  <p>Climate adaptation action in Vanuatu can only be met if we work together. International investment, action and support are critically needed to ensure innovative and resilient development. Putting this NDC into effect will necessitate a transformative shift from business as usual. Working through a whole of government approach across the three pillars of sustainable development will need a renewed focus on building and strengthening institutional capacity. It also requires strong coordination of the partnerships with business, civil society, development agencies and donors, aligning their contributions to our national climate priorities and ensuring programme delivery takes place through national systems. To build a better and more resilient Vanuatu, we need to be supportive, empathetic, inventive, passionate and, above all, cooperative.</p>

  <p><strong>DECENTRALISATION</strong></p>
  <p>Decentralisation brings government closer to the people by providing citizens with greater control over decision-making processes and allowing their direct participation in public service delivery. Urban areas on several islands are growing rapidly, and thus hold the key to successful national emission reduction and development of adaptative capacities. Vanuatu’s urban and peri-urban residents are increasingly vulnerable to multiple climate change risks and these risks are especially critical for the urban poor and marginalised populations. There is a need to 1) devolve decision-making authority, functions and resources for more effective delivery of climate related services; 2) design and implement mechanisms to ensure a “bottom up” flow of integrated and resilient development planning and budgeting from the Area Councils (ACs) to the National Government, and 3) enhance political and administrative authority in order to effectively and efficiently deliver climate action and services to the grassroots level.</p>

  <p><strong>CLIMATE POLICY AND PLANS</strong></p>
  <p>The National Policy on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction 2016-2030, provides the framework to ensure that our communities, environment and economy are resilient to the impacts of climate change and disaster risks. The policy ensures that risks are identified, assessed, reduced and managed. It was formulated following a risk governance assessment to analyse Vanuatu’s climate change and disaster risk governance capacity and needs at both national and local levels. The policy applies six principles: 1) accountability, 2) sustainability, 3) equity, 4) community focus, 5) collaboration, and 6) innovation. It aims to be implemented by all Government agencies and non-Governmental stakeholders. The policy takes a practical approach regarding Vanuatu’s resources, exposure to risks, and demographic situation. It seeks to strengthen existing capacity at national, provincial and area council levels, drawing on the country’s rich heritage, traditional knowledge, and the lessons learned from the broad range of initiatives regarding climate change and disaster risk reduction.</p>

  <p><strong>METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATE INFORMATION SERVICES</strong></p>
  <p>Meteorology and climate services must reach all end-users, and play a central role in effectively helping people manage and adapt to climate variability and change in Vanuatu. The production and dissemination of climate data and information, an integral part of what can be referred to as a Climate Early Warning System (CLEWS), are an essential part of Vanuatu’s adaptation strategy. The goal of Vanuatu’s CLEWS is for it to be integrated with other hazard warnings as a Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for the benefit of all ni-Vanuatu society.</p>

  <p><strong>TOURISM</strong></p>
  <p>Vanuatu is the 8th most tourism dependant country in the world, and is seeking to address its dependencies on tourism while supporting its people to stay strong and resilient in the face of future challenges. Sustainable tourism relies on the actions of people, cooperation between the public and private sector and consideration of rural communities. Therefore, increasing rural involvement in the tourism industry is prioritised through enhancing quality of services and improving infrastructure in rural areas, increasing sustainable local and foreign investment partnerships, diversification through agritourism and providing better access and marketing of all provinces. Tourism contributions to the economy are significant and the continued integration into the overall economy (both urban and rural) is critical to continued economic growth.</p>

  <p><strong>FINANCE</strong></p>
  <p>With hardly any global carbon budget left, there can be no delay in action. Transformational action on emissions reduction must occur as fast as possible in rich countries, followed by unprecedented rapid reduction rates in low emission countries like Vanuatu – enabled by significantly enhanced finance and support from richer countries for climate mitigation, resilience building, adaptation and Loss and Damage provisions. As developing countries like Vanuatu have contributed little to present day emission levels, the Paris Agreement clearly articulates the role developed countries play in efforts to both reducing emissions and supporting the mitigation and adaptation efforts of developing countries. As such, many of Vanuatu’s most ambitious commitments are conditional upon receiving international support (finance, technology transfer and capacity building).</p>

  <h2>Loss and Damage Contribution</h2>
  <h3>Vanuatu Enhanced NDC (Loss and Damage)</h3>
  <p>Through no fault of its own considering its negligible contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (0.0016%), Vanuatu is already experiencing devastating effects of climate change manifested as loss and damage. Vanuatu annually suffers irrecoverable loss and damage from climate change events, including for example over 600 million USD (more than 60% of GDP) as a result of one storm, Cyclone Harold in 2020, and billions more over the last decade from slow onset impacts like ocean acidification killing our coral reefs, and sea level rise eating away our coastlines.</p>
  <p>Loss and damage from climate change impacts is included in Vanuatu’s National Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy (CCDRR) which also outlines concrete actions. National stakeholders have identified irreversible loss and damage resulting from all climate hazards, including from floods, storms, cyclones, salinisation, sea level rise and more. The most challenging issues include addressing loss and damage from slow onset events and addressing non-economic losses and damages. Action and support for addressing loss and damage is urgently required, including finance, technology and capacity building.</p>
  <p>Vanuatu has championed the right to compensation for climate loss and damage in all avenues, particularly as States and corporations fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and continue to expand the exploration, extraction and use fossil fuels. Vanuatu will continue to push for the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage, and the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage to step up and provide finance, action and other urgently needed support to small island developing states like Vanuatu. Where UN mechanisms are unable to provide adequate relief from loss and damage resulting from the negligent actions of fossil fuel-related companies and the states that subsidise them, Vanuatu will seek redress elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Vanuatu calls for the establishment and rapid mobilization of a Loss and Damage Finance Facility under the UNFCCC in order to fill critical financial gaps experienced already by our most vulnerable communities, and to address loss and damage through constructive multilateral process and thereby avoid costly legal pathways.</p>
  <p>In this context, when the Republic of Vanuatu deposited its Paris Agreement instrument of ratification on 21 September 2016, the compendium declaration reads, in part:</p>
  <p>“…the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu declares its understanding that ratification of the Paris Agreement shall in no way constitute a renunciation of any rights under any other laws, including international law, and the communication depositing the Republic’s instrument of ratification shall include a declaration to this effect for international record.”</p>
  <p>The following Loss and Damage Targets have been defined in a decentralised way, by the sectors that are themselves implementing and planning for a resilient future.</p>

  <h2>Means of Implementation</h2>
  <p>In total, the approximate cost of achieving Vanuatu’s Revised and Enhanced NDC is USD 1,214,350,000.</p>
  <p><img width="658" height="306" alt="image" src="img/VUT-NDC1-17.png"></p>
  <p>Vanuatu’s conditional mitigation targets are estimated to cost USD 315,600,000. This cost estimate does not cover the costs of existing measures i.e. measures included in the first NDC of Vanuatu, since these measures are under implementation and already budgeted under NERM 2016–2030. Furthermore, the costs for additional measures are tentative and based on similar international experiences, national circumstances of Vanuatu and other assumptions. A detailed scoping and feasibility study of enhanced NDC measures will be conducted under the NDC implementation roadmap development to determine the exact additional investment requirements.</p>
  <p>The approximate cost of achieving Vanuatu’s conditional adaptation targets is estimated to be USD 721,080,000 and loss and damage targets are estimated to cost USD 177,670,000.</p>
  <p><img width="658" height="350" alt="image" src="img/VUT-NDC1-18.png"></p>
  <p>These figures represent the highest priority placed by Vanuatu on resilience, and the extremely high costs associated with the limits to adaptation, as exemplified by the devastating financial, social and environmental losses and damages experienced already and expected to increase exponentially as climate change accelerates. The costs for these measures are tentative and based on similar international experiences, national circumstances of Vanuatu and other assumptions. Finance, technology and capacity are urgently required to undertake detailed scoping and feasibility studies of the enhanced NDC to determine the exact additional investment requirements.</p>
  <p>To achieve all mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage conditional targets, Vanuatu anticipates financial, technological and capacity building support from global funds such as the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund; and bilateral/multilateral agencies and development partners. These funds will be used to bolster limited national resources and technical capacities for scaling up climate action.</p>
  <p>The activities will be implemented over a period of 10 years (2021–2030) by integrating them under the government’s recurrent budgets as various subsidy policies, projects or programmes. As these targets are well aligned with the country’s existing policies and plans, they will have high ownership and will be implemented in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>Vanuatu has the institutional structure for implementation of the enhanced NDC. The National Advisory Board on Climate Change & Disaster Risk Reduction (NAB) is the supreme policy making and advisory body for all disaster risk reduction and climate change programmes, projects, initiatives and activities in Vanuatu. The NAB develops Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change policies, guidelines and positions, advises on international and regional DRR and CC obligations, facilitates and endorses the development of new DRR and CC programmes, projects, initiatives and activities, acts as a focal point for information sharing and coordination on CC/DRR, and guides and coordinates the development of national climate finance processes.</p>
  <p>The Ministry of Climate Change Adaptation (MoCC), Meteorology and Geo-Hazards, Energy, Environment and National Disaster Management is the nodal agency as part of the Government’s efforts to streamline Vanuatu’s climate change natural disaster responses and sustainable development of the environment. The Department of Climate Change (DoCC), within the Ministry of Climate Change, is mandated to ensure that high quality services are provided in relation to climate change in Vanuatu. The Ministry and the National Advisory Board (NAB) are mandated with coordinating all government and non-government initiatives addressing climate change and disaster risk reduction in the country.</p>
  <p>The Vanuatu revised and enhanced NDC will be implemented in close coordination with other line ministries including, but not limited to, the Ministries of Lands, Infrastructure and Public Utilities, Education, Health, Agriculture, Justice and Community Services, Foreign Affairs, Finance, etc., and other government departments including the Department of Climate Change (DoCC), Department of Energy (DoE), Department of Environment, Utilities Regulatory Authority (URA), public and private sector mainly UNELCO Engie (UNELCO), Vanuatu Utilities and Infrastructure Limited (VUI), and other private sector service providers; donor agencies and development partners and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>

      <td>
        <p>As per paragraph 31(c) of decision 1/CP.21, Vanuatu is not including all IPCC sectors, sub-sectors and categories. Regardless, Vanuatu’s NDC target constitutes the highest possible ambition, in the context of our national analyses of mitigation potential.</p>
        <p>According to national circumstances that Vanuatu is a small-island state, with limited technical, financial and skilled resources to collect data, process and analyse data, Vanuatu has decided that at this time, other sources and sinks of emissions (most of negligible relevance for Vanuatu) would not be included in this updated NDC.</p>
        <p>Note that all key categories and gases identified as relevant for Vanuatu have been included in the NDC. Furthermore, Vanuatu is willing to include other remaining categories of anthropogenic emissions or removals (as may become applicable) in its future nationally determined contributions.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu aims to extend the scope of the coverage of its NDC over time to all categories of anthropogenic emissions and removal, as more robust data, finance, technical support and capacity becomes available. This approach is in line with the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.”</p>
        <p>Vanuatu plans to demonstrate leadership among developing countries by continuing to enhance its mitigation efforts and to move towards economy-wide emissions limitation or reduction targets over time.</p>
        <p>In keeping with Article 2 of the UNFCCC, Vanuatu demands that emission stabilisation should be achieved globally, and domestically by all countries within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.</p>

      </td>
      <td>
        <p>The majority of Vanuatu’s adaptation and loss and damage commitments contain mitigation co-benefits. In many cases (for example in infrastructure, forestry and waste adaptation targets), it is difficult to classify a target as primarily adaptation or purely mitigation.</p>
        <p>Some of the co-benefits expected for specific activities are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Carbon sequestration by developing and implementing better practices in agricultural, livestock and forestry production;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Climate proofing buildings and infrastructure often involves using more fossil fuel efficient designs and lowering emissions profiles</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Reduced emissions from implementing fuel efficient technologies for aquaculture and fishing operations;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Reduced emissions from wastewater management and introduction of renewable energy technologies in the Water sector;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Reduced emissions from implementing resilient ecosystem and environmental activities to better manage the available ecosystem services and resources.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions contained within this NDC were not quantitatively evaluated due to a lack of quality data and technical resources. However, Vanuatu will soon begin efforts to develop its NAP, including a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan which will focus on tracking the implementation of the cross-sectoral measures with mitigation co-benefits. This tool will monitor and evaluate adaptation, and to some extent, mitigation actions on climate change implemented in Vanuatu and include new or additional information as part of the NAP iterative process.</p>
        <p>The mitigation co-benefits from forest sector interventions cannot be included at this point due to ongoing negotiations on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, in conjunction with Vanuatu’s rollout of a national REDD+ programme.</p>

        <p>The Republic of Vanuatu’s NDC has been through two iterations from 2021–2022, with the primary purpose of making it more ambitious by including sector-led adaptation and loss and damage commitments.</p>
        <p>Both iterations of the revised and enhanced NDC have been developed through an inclusive and participatory process, with a series of public and in-person consultations.</p>
        <p>The mitigation enhancement process was led by the Department of Climate Change (DoCC) under the guidance of the Ministry of Climate Change Adaptation, Meteorology, GeoHazards Energy, Environment and Disaster Management (MoCC).</p>
        <p>The stakeholders of all line ministries and departments of Government of Vanuatu engaged in the mitigation revision included the Department of Energy, Department of Environmental Protection and Conservation, Department of Forests, Department of Meteorology, Department of Geological Hazards, Department of Fisheries, Department of Livestock, Department of Biosecurity, Department of Strategic Planning and Aid Coordination, Department of Women’s Affairs gender policy, etc., also participated in the NDC enhancement process. The private sector including utility companies, energy sector vendors, development partners and NGOs were engaged and consulted during the NDC revision process.</p>
        <p>On 27 May 2022, the Parliament of the Republic of Vanuatu officially Declared a Climate Emergency including the decision to submit this revised and enhanced NDC before COP27 as per obligations under the COP26 Glasgow Pact.</p>
        <p>The adaptation and loss and damage enhancement process involved stakeholders from the Departments of Climate Change, Environment, Energy, Environment, Water, Meteorology/Geohazards, Strategic</p>
        <p>Policy Planning/Aid Coordination, Local Authorities, Finance, Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries, Biosecurity, Foreign Affairs, Public Works, Women’s Affairs, State Law, Disaster Management, Education, Tourism and Statistics. In addition, the following representatives from private sector and non-government organizations provided expert guidance and input: Vanuatu Climate Action Network, Vanuatu Association of NGOs, Vanuatu Climate Adaptation Project, Save the Children, Live and Learn, Global Green Growth Institute, UK High Commission, Vanuatu Business Resilience Council, UN Development Programme, Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, the Pacific Community, German Agency for International Cooperation, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the Pacific NDC Hub.</p>
        <p>Consultations were carried out at the national level for mitigation given the small size and population of Vanuatu and COVID-19 emergency measures, while adaptation and loss and damage consultations also reached the largest province of SANMA. However, the government departments, private sector participants, NGOs and development partners are also involved with projects and programmes at subnational level and thus adequately represented subnational level stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Gender equality and the inclusion of women, youth, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups was an integral part of the NDC enhancement process. A gender expert within the Department of Climate Change Team reviewed the gender-responsive considerations in the enhanced NDC. n addition, a gender analysis was commissioned by the Pacific NDC Hub and provided recommendations on the gender- sensitive implementation of this revised and enhanced NDC.</p>
        <p>The enhanced NDC actions/measures comply with key issues and requirements of gender sensitive design as per the national policies and ‘Gender Analysis and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)’ guidance. None of the enhanced NDC actions are expected to impact negatively on gender equality and women’s rights, or limit women’s access to and control over natural resources and the goods and services covered under the enhanced NDC.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, all targets and commitments align with the requirements under NSDP, CCDRR Policy and NERM. These policies extensively promote gender responsive, youth-specific needs and roles on green employment, awareness and capacity building.</p>
        <p>The enhanced NDC actions/measure will contribute positively on gender, youth and other vulnerable group-specific needs and will provide these demographics the opportunity to play a more active role in design and implementation.</p>
        <p>All targets have undergone scrutiny by experts and leaders through a series of internal and external consultation carried out during the NDC enhancement process and several national level public consultations to receive the comments and feedback.</p>
        <p>Further, the enhanced/revised NDC has been endorsed by the Vanuatu’s National Advisory Board on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (NAB – the supreme policy making and advisory body for all disaster risk reduction and climate change programmes, projects, initiatives and activities in Vanuatu) and Council of Ministers (CoM), Government of Vanuatu.</p>

        <p>Geography: The Republic of Vanuatu is an island nation located in the Western Pacific Ocean. Vanuatu is an archipelago of over 80 islands stretching 1,300 kilometres from North to South in the Western Pacific Ocean. Vanuatu is located between latitude 12º to 23º South and longitude 166º to 173º East.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu’s terrain is mostly mountainous, with narrow coastal plains with a total land area of 12,336 km2 and a maritime exclusive economic zone of 680,000 km2. Almost 74% of the land area in Vanuatu is covered by natural vegetation, with around one third covered by forest; which is more than 36.1% (440,000 hectares covered by tropical forest).</p>
        <p>The largest island is Espiritu Santo, while the island of Efate is home to the capital, Port Vila and the central Vanuatu Government. From largest to smallest, the islands are Espiritu Santo, Malekula, Efate, Erromango, Ambrym, Tanna, Pentecost, Epi, Ambae or Aoba, Vanua Lava, Gaua, Maewo, Malo, and Anatom or Aneityum. The two largest islands, Espiritu Santo and Malekula, comprise nearly 50% of the total land mass. Larger islands are characterised by rugged volcanic peaks and tropical rainforests. The highest peak, Mount Tabwemasana on Espiritu Santo, is 1877m above mean sea level and the total coastline is about 2,528 km long.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu is geographically located in the “ring of fire” and the “cyclone belt” of the Pacific. The island nation is located in a seismically and volcanically active region and has high exposure to geologic hazards, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and landslides. Almost 81% of its landmass and 76% of its population is exposed to two or more potential hazards including volcanic eruptions, cyclones, earthquakes, droughts, tsunamis, storm surges, coastal and river flooding and landslides.</p>
        <p>Climate: Vanuatu is situated in a tropical maritime climate with characteristic uniform temperature, high humidity and variable rainfall. The tropical climate is moderated by southeast trade winds that occur from May to October. There are two main seasons, hot and wet from November to April, and cool and dry from May to October. Being an equatorial country, Vanuatu has relatively uniform temperature throughout the year with daily temperature ranging from 20°C to 30°C. Temperatures in the warmest months (January- February) are about 4°C higher than those in the coolest months (July-August).</p>
        <p>Population: According to the most recent National Population and Housing censuses (NPHC) of 2020, Vanuatu's population was 300,019 compared to 272,459 in 2016's mini census and 234,023 in 2009's census. Vanuatu's population is largely based within rural areas ~77.7% as per 2020 NPHC.</p>
        <p>Economy: Vanuatu is traditionally known for its strong cultural heritage, traditional activities and subsistence farming. The four mainstays of Vanuatu’s economy are agriculture, tourism, offshore financial services, and raising cattle. Exports include copra, kava, beef, cocoa, and timber, and imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, and fuel.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Vanuatu’s economy grew by 4.4% with a strong performance over the last three years. Subsequently it was further projected for the economy to grow by 3.4% in 2018 from 2017 growth levels. Growth was primarily driven by construction activities related to the on-going infrastructure development projects and reconstruction projects from category 5 tropical cyclone Pam in 2015.</p>
        <p>In early 2020, category 5 tropical cyclone Harold struck multiple islands in Northern Vanuatu causing losses and damages of over 60% of GDP. Soon afterward the COVID-19 lockdowns took a serious toll on tourism and other service sectors. With no income tax revenues, the Government has maintained budget flows through its citizenship by investment programmes. Overall, the economy has stagnated since 2020 requiring extensive government subsidies and private sector support programmes.</p>

        <p>In addition to the planning process discussed in section 4 (a) (i). The Government of Vanuatu has taken a one-of-a-kind initiative to identify the circular economy options for Vanuatu and constituted the metabolic analysis of its economy and economic sectors.</p>
        <p>A metabolic assessment has been conducted to define a resource efficient and low-carbon future for Vanuatu. The metabolic assessment observed that the average material uses and per capita GHG emissions in Vanuatu is low in comparison to the global average. The existing consumption-based resource footprint of Vanuatu is 58%, which is already relatively circular, meaning that 58% of the materials used in the country is relying on secondary or renewable materials and energy sources.</p>
        <p>The remaining 42% of material use is not circular and can be characterised as following a linear ‘take-make-waste’ trajectory. These 42% of materials are mostly of foreign origin and undermine the development ambitions of the country since they create issues with waste disposal and the deterioration of natural assets as a result of the pollution of soils, surface waters and marine environments. The circular economy analysis identified some of the opportunities which contribute to the domestic and transboundary (international) GHG emission reductions. Some of the key circular economy actions (CE strategies) identified by the metabolic assessment have been included in Vanuatu’s enhanced NDC.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Government of Vanuatu has also developed and implemented an Integrated Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) Tool for the Energy Sector (currently being enhanced to cover additional mitigation sectors according to the updated NDC) and a Monitoring, Reporting Verification Tool for NERM 2016–2030. Vanuatu’s integrated MRV Tool is a first of Its kind initiative to integrate most of the domestic and international climate action monitoring, tracking and reporting requirements. Further, it supports government agencies, development partners, and NGOs towards evidence-based decisions and data insights reporting. Vanuatu’s integrated MRV Tool has been customised to track, monitor and report data critical for climate actions and sustainable development goals.</p>
        <p>One of Vanuatu’s most advanced and transformative best practices is the establishment of the National Advisory Board on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction which achieves two goals: 1) the merging of resources to address both climate and non-climate disasters into a single institutional framework and 2) providing a single entry point for climate change policy and governance which embodies a range of ministries, sectors and stakeholders. This enhanced and revised NDC would not have been able to include both adaptation and loss and damage without such an integrated and comprehensive institutional structure.</p>
        <p>Another important best practice employed in the development of this NDC is the full reliance and decentralisation of climate action to sectors. Sector agencies and stakeholders know best the ambitions and realities of action and have already codified these into their endorsed and gazetted policies, plans and strategies. Thus, this NDC uses the outstanding work being planned and actioned, without duplicating work or causing consultation fatigue.</p>
        <p>The following are additional best practices that have been identified during the preparation of Vanuatu’s NDC:</p>
        <p>A key component of Vanuatu’s NDC is that it was built upon existing processes, data collection, policies, initiatives, and commitments. In doing so, Vanuatu was able to take advantage of updated inventories, robust data and crosscutting expertise.</p>
        <p>Capitalising on the synergies and timing of the different processes, Vanuatu increased collaboration across Implementing Partners and reduced the need to conduct separate stakeholder consultations on similar issues, therefore reducing stakeholder fatigue. It is essential for Implementing Partners to work together in a seamless manner.</p>
        <p>The engagement of stakeholders from public sector, private sector, academia and civil society was key to ensuring the interest and buy-in to the NDC process and revised targets.</p>

        <p>The majority of households in Vanuatu are located in remote locations with no on-grid electricity access, in fact, most households already rely on renewable energy to meet their basic lighting and cooking needs. Thus there will be minimal consequences for the people of Vanuatu as the nation enables the transition of economies and societies away from fossil fuels and towards a low-carbon future. Rather, the implementation of mitigation policies, programmes and actions “in-jurisdiction” are widely expected to bring adaptation and resilience co-benefits.</p>

        <p>There are multiple projects and project concepts currently underway and already approved by the National Advisory Board on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction which are expected to have mitigation co- benefits from adaptation and loss and damage actions. For example:</p>
        <p>Climate Information Services for Resilient Development in Vanuatu (Van-KIRAP)- including adaptation activities around climate start agriculture, expanded use of renewable energy, climate smart tourism and other adaptation-mitigation initiatives.</p>
        <p>Adaptation to Climate Change in the Coastal Zone in Vanuatu Project (VCAP2) – includes climate smart infrastructure as well as ecosystem-based adaptation (protected forest areas) and other adaptation- mitigation initiatives.</p>
        <p>Blue Carbon Project will focus on protecting and enhancing management of coastal habitats including coral reefs and mangroves and other adaptation-mitigation initiatives.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu Community-based Climate Resilience project will reduce the climate-related vulnerabilities of communities across Vanuatu; increase their resilience to climate variability, extremes and change; and build the adaptive capacity required to ensure communities can maintain sustainable development pathways across a wide range of climate futures.</p>
        <p>As mentioned in 3(d) above, Vanuatu is still in the process of developing additional programming for other priority sectors for adaptation and loss and damage. As the development of the NAP is a continuous and ongoing process, these might, in the future, include projects with mitigation co-benefits on adaptation actions; however, they are not mentioned here as the specific projects could change or additional projects added to the current project portfolios.</p>

      </td>
      <td>
        <p>The Government of Vanuatu is steadfast in its conviction that global mitigation efforts should focus on stabilising global GHG emissions at levels that will limit increases in global average temperatures to well below 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu is a small island developing country, that has an insignificant contribution to global GHG emissions, historically its GHG emissions have been very low: Vanuatu’s total CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent emissions was approximately 0.0011% of the Global GHG emissions for 2015.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu has taken an ambitious target of transitioning to close to 100% renewable energy in the electricity sector by 2030. With this enhanced NDC, Vanuatu is planning to further reduce its national GHG emissions by 2030. Vanuatu’s adaptation and loss and damage targets are some of the most ambitious and comprehensive in the world, highlighting the priority of these two pillars of the Paris Agreement to Vanuatu. Thus, this NDC, and the accompanying information, reflects Vanuatu’s commitment under the Paris Agreement to address climate change.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu’s NDC target constitutes the highest possible ambition, in the context of our national analyses of mitigation potential.</p>
        <p>Vanuatu plans to demonstrate leadership among developing countries by continuing to enhance our mitigation efforts and to move towards economy-wide emissions limitation or reduction targets over time.</p>

This approach is in line with the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.”</p>
        <p>In keeping with Article 2 of the UNFCCC, Vanuatu demands that emission stabilisation should be achieved globally, and domestically by all countries within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.</p>

        <p>It must also be noted that the value of Vanuatu’s forest cover as a carbon sink is recognised, despite the fact that these values are not included in the projections.</p>
        <p>In addition to the sectoral activity-based targets for electricity generation, transport energy efficiency, other livestock, and waste sector, this NDC also includes additional policy targets for sectors where data and/or baseline information is not available such as for livestock, solid waste and wastewater management.

        <p>Vanuatu feels that Article 2 of the convention is closely linked to Article 8 of the Paris Agreement on the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage.</p>
        <p>Sadly, Vanuatu has reached the limits of adaptation in many instances, with climate change already causing loss and damage as exemplified in Article 2, disenabling ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, witnessing threats to food security, and observing devastation to economic development.</p>
        <p>In this context, Vanuatu’s enhanced and revised NDC makes every effort to more comprehensively to undertake adaptation action, while at the same time, calling for increased support to address loss and damage. All three Pillars of the Paris Agreement are critical, and equally addressed in this NDC.</p>
