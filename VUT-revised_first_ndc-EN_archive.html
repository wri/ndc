<h1>Vanuatu’s First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) (Updated Submission 2020)</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction </h2>
<p>The Republic of Vanuatu is an island nation located in the Western Pacific Ocean. Vanuatu is an archipelago of over 80 islands stretching 1,300 kilometers from North to South in the Western Pacific Ocean. Vanuatu’s society, environment and economy are highly vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks. In Vanuatu climate change is likely to impact all sectors especially agriculture, water, coastal and marine resources and infrastructure as well as tourism. The devastating consequences of the category 5 tropical cyclone in March 2015 and the subsequent severe El Nino event highlight country’s risk from natural disasters. Predicted increases in extreme weather from climate change means Vanuatu will face even greater impacts in the future, also living with the constant threat of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis.</p>
<p>Vanuatu has negligible GHG emissions and forest sector act as a net sink; however, the Government of Republic of Vanuatu is fully committed to effective, and transparent implementation of the Paris Agreement (PA). The Government of Republic of Vanuatu notes with great concern that the objective of the Paris Agreement can only be achieved through a significant enhancement of the level of action complemented by international support provided to achieve conditional contributions, as reflected in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In that spirit, the Republic of Vanuatu presents It’s enhanced NDCs for the period 2021-2030 and calls on all Parties to increase ambition and move collectively onto emission reduction pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C warming limit.</p>
<h2 id="vanuatus-long-term-vision-on-climate-change">2. Vanuatu’s Long-Term Vision on Climate Change </h2>
<p>The Republic of Vanuatu’s long term vision on climate change and aspirations are embedded within the fundamental duties defined under its constitution: <em><strong>“to protect the Republic of Vanuatu and to safeguard the national wealth, resources and environment in the interests of the present generation and of future generations</strong>”</em> and guided by its National Vision - <em><strong>“A stable, sustainable and prosperous Vanuatu”</strong>,</em> under the National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2016 to 2030 also called Vanuatu 2030: The People’s Plan. The collective developmental aspirations under the NSDP includes: A vibrant cultural identity underpinning a peaceful, just and inclusive society; Supported by responsive and capable state institutions delivering quality public services, including health and education, to all citizens; Maintaining a pristine natural environment on land and at sea that serves our food, cultural, economic and ecological needs; With enhanced resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change and natural disasters; and A stable economy based on equitable, sustainable growth that creates jobs and income earning opportunities accessible to all people in rural and urban areas.</p>
<p>The Republic of Vanuatu’s long-term climate action vision is governed by the Vanuatu Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy 2016-2030 (CCDRR Policy – to promotes good governance and establishes priorities and strategies for future climate actions; and ‘Meteorology, Geological Hazards and Climate Change Act No. 25 of 2016 (Climate Change Act)’, that provides provisions (governance and administrative provisions), transparency and roles and responsibility for meteorology, geological hazards and climate change and for related purposes.</p>
<h2 id="vanuatus-first-ndc-submission-2016">3. Vanuatu’s First NDC Submission (2016) </h2>
<p>Vanuatu submitted its first NDC to the UNFCCC on 21st September 2016. The main mitigation contribution under this submission is to achieve the outcomes and targets under the National Energy Road Map (NERM) and Second National Communication (SNC) extended to 2030. The mitigation contribution for the Vanuatu INDC submission is a sector specific target of transitioning to close to 100% renewable energy in the electricity sector by 2030. This target would replace nearly all fossil fuel requirements for electricity generation in the country and be consistent with the National Energy Road Map (NERM) target of 65% renewable energy by 2020. This contribution would reduce emissions in the energy sector by 72Gg by 2030. Emissions in this sector were around 130 Gg in 2010 but are expected to rise to 240 Gg by 2030 (3% per annum).</p>
<p>The mitigation would thus reduce BAU emissions in the electricity sub-sector by 100% and in the energy sector as a whole by 30%. The target would be conditional, depending on funding commensurate with putting the transition in place being made available from external sources. In addition, The transition to renewable energy based electricity could be accelerated through review and revision of agricultural (coconut oil sector) national policy. Opportunities for reducing the high emissions levels in agriculture will simultaneously be pursued with cooperative programs with nations having similarly high emissions in this sector. The forestry sector mitigation will be attended to as part of the existing REDD+ program. The Government is also aware that waste management is an other area that need attention.</p>

<p>The stakeholders of all line ministries and department of Government of Vanuatu engaged in the NDC enhancement/revision including Department of Energy (DoE), Department of Environmental Protection and Conservation, Department of Forests, Department of Meteorology, Department of Geological Hazards,</p>
<p>Department of Fisheries, Department of Livestock, Department of Biosecurity, Department of Strategic Planning and Aid Coordination,Department of Women’s Affairs gender policy etc. also participated in the NDC enhancement process.</p>
<p>The private sector including utility companies, energy sector vendors, development partners and NGOs were engaged and consulted during the NDC revision process. The consultation was carried out at the national level given the small size and population of Vanuatu and COVID-19 emergency measures sub-national level consultation could not take place. However; the government departments, private sector participants, NGOs and development partners also involve with the projects and programme at subnational level and adequately represented subnational level stakeholders.</p>
<p>Gender equality and other vulnerable group inclusion was an integral part of NDC enhancement process, the gender expert with the DoCC Team was engaged in NDC enhancement and reviewed the enhanced NDC options to review the gender-responsive considerations. The enhanced NDC actions/measures complies with key issues and requirements of gender sensitive design as per the national policies and ‘Gender Analysis and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)’ guidance.</p>
<p>None of the identified enhanced NDC actions impacts negatively on gender equality and women’s rights, limits access or influence on women’s access to and control over natural resources and the goods and services covered under the enhanced NDC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the align with the requirements under NSDP and NERM; both the policy extensively covers the gender responsive, youth-specific needs and roles; specifically, on green employment, awareness and capacity building.</p>
<p>The enhanced NDC actions/measure will contribute positively on gender, youth and other vulnerable group-specific needs and will provide them opportunities to play actively role in design and implementation.</p>
<p>Series of internal and external consultation carried out during the NDC enhancement process and a national level public consultation conducted to receive the comments and feedback on NDC.</p>
<p>Further, the enhanced/revised NDC has been endorsed by the Vanuatu's National Advisory Board on Climate Change &amp; Disaster Risk reduction (NAB - the supreme policy making and advisory body for all disaster risk reduction and climate change programs, projects, initiatives and activities in Vanuatu) and Council of Ministers (CoM), Government of Vanuatu.</p></th>

<td>The Republic of Vanuatu is an island nation located in the Western Pacific Ocean. Vanuatu is an archipelago of over 80 islands stretching 1,300 kilometers from North to South in the Western Pacific Ocean. Vanuatu is located between latitude 12º to 23º South and longitude 166º to 173º East. Vanuatu’s terrain is mostly mountainous, with narrow coastal plains with a total land area of 12,336 km<sup>2</sup> and a maritime exclusive economic zone of 680,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Almost 74% of the land area in Vanuatu is covered by natural vegetation, with around one third covered by forest; which is more than 36.1% (440,000 hectares covered by tropical forest).</p>
<p>The largest island is Espiritu Santo, while the island of Efate is home to the capital, Port Vila and the central Vanuatu Government. From largest to smallest, the islands are Espiritu Santo, Malekula, Efate, Erromango, Ambrym, Tanna, Pentecost, Epi, Ambae or Aoba, Vanua Lava, Gaua, Maewo, Malo, and Anatom or Aneityum. The two largest islands; Espiritu Santo and Malekula comprise nearly 50% of the total land mass. Larger islands are characterised by rugged volcanic peaks and tropical rainforests. The highest peak, Mount Tabwemasana on Espiritu Santo, is 1877m above mean sea level and the total coastline is about 2,528 km long.</p>
<p>Vanuatu is geographically located in the “ring of fire” and the “cyclone belt” of the Pacific. The island nation is located in a seismically and volcanically active region and has high exposure to geologic hazards, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and landslides. Almost 81% of its landmass and 76% of its population is exposed to two or more potential hazards including volcanic eruptions, cyclones, earthquakes, droughts, tsunamis, storm surge, coastal and river flooding and landslides.</p>
<p>Vanuatu is situated in a tropical maritime climate with characteristic uniform temperature, high humidity and variable rainfall. The tropical climate is moderated by southeast trade winds that occur from May to October. There are two main seasons, hot and wet from November to April, and cool and dry from May to October. Being an equatorial country, Vanuatu has relatively uniform temperature throughout the year with daily temperature ranging from 20°C to 30°C. Temperatures in the warmest months (January - February) are about 4°C higher than those in the coolest months (July-August).</p>
<p>According to the most recent (Mini) census undertaken in 2016, Vanuatu’s population was reported to be a total count of 272,459 compared to a population count of 234,023 in the last 2009 census. Vanuatu’s population is largely based within its’ rural areas – 75% as per 2016 mini census.</p>
<p>Vanuatu is traditionally known for its strong cultural heritage tradition activities and subsistence farming. The four mainstays of Vanuatu’s economy are agriculture, tourism, offshore financial services, and raising cattle. Exports include copra, kava, beef, cocoa, and timber, and imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, and fuel.</p>
<p>In 2017, Vanuatu’s economy grew by 4.4% with a strong performance over the last three previous years. Subsequently it was further projected for the economy to grow by 3.4% in 2018 from 2017 growth levels. Growth was primarily driven by construction activities related to the on-going infrastructure development projects and reconstruction projects from tropical cyclone Pam (VNSO 2019; RBV 2018).</p>

<p>In addition to the planning process discussed in section 4 (a) (i). The Government of Vanuatu has taken one of its kind initiative to identify the circular economy options for Vanuatu and constituted the metabolic analysis of its economy and economic sectors.</p>
<p>A metabolic assessment has been conducted to define a resource efficient and low-carbon future for Vanuatu. The metabolic assessment observed that, the average material uses and per capita GHG emissions in Vanuatu is low in comparison to the global average. The existing consumptionbased resource footprint of Vanuatu is 58% relatively circular. Already for 58% of the materials used, the country is relying on secondary or renewable materials and energy sources.</p>
<p>The remaining 42% of material use is not circular and can be characterised as following a linear ‘take-make-waste’ trajectory. These 42% of materials are mostly of foreign origin and collide with the development ambitions of the country since they create issues with waste disposal and the deterioration of natural assets as a result of the pollution of soils, surface waters and marine environments. The circular economy analysis identified some of the opportunities which contribute to the domestic and transboundary (international) GHG emission reductions. Some of the key circular economy actions (CE strategies) identified by the metabolic assessment have been include in Vanuatu’s enhanced NDC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Government of Vanuatu has also developed and implemented Integrated Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) Tool for Energy Sector (currently being enhanced to cover additional mitigation sectors according to the updated NDC) and a Monitoring, Reporting Verification Tool for NERM 2016-2030.</p>
<p>Vanuatu’s integrated MRV Tool is a first of Its kind initiative to integrate most of the domestic and international climate action monitoring, tracking and reporting requirements. Further, it supports government agencies, development partners, d and NGOs towards evidence-based decisions and data insights reporting. Vanuatu’s integrated MRV Tool has been customized to track, monitor and report data critical for climate actions and sustainable development goals.</p></td>

<h2 id="adaptation-component-of-updated-ndc">5. Adaptation Component of Updated NDC </h2>
<p>As per Article 7.10 and 7.11 of the Paris Agreement, Vanuatu will submit an adaptation communication, which will include its priorities, implementation and support needs, plans and actions through the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The NAP will outline Vanuatu's contribution towards meeting the adaptation goal set out in the Paris Agreement and the required means of implementation to implement that contribution fully. However, in early 2020, with support from the Regional Pacific Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Hub the Vanuatu Government set out to enhance the adaptation component of its NDC. The purpose of that particular process was to strengthen the existing content on adaptation in the NDC by developing quantifiable targets for adaptation that will be communicated to the UNFCCC. The objectives were to do so through developing national quantifiable climate change adaptation targets and indicators for the in two priority sectors: agriculture and water. Further to this, this process aimed to determine how to incorporate climate change loss and damage (L&amp;D) considerations into the development of water and agriculture sector targets and indicators.</p>
<p>Adaptation targets and indicators for the water and agriculture sector were developed with the objectives of maintaining food security, income security and water security. Stakeholders placed high priority on income security by strengthening small-medium enterprises. Such a target has not emerged before in any of the previous policies or strategies. A second area of importance was the production of food for own consumption. The overarching goal for the agricultural sector was identified as: <strong>“</strong><em>Agriculture is able to support household <strong>income</strong> and <strong>food</strong> needs in a changing climate</em>”. To achieve this goal, two targets were established (Annexed):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Ag1:</strong> By 2022, 80% of <strong>agriculture SMEs and private sector operators</strong> are able to generate sufficient income to cover essential household needs and services in <strong>normal and</strong> (climate, disaster and environmentally) <strong>stressed times.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Ag2:</strong> By 2030, 100% of identified measures for enhancing the resilience of subsistence agriculture in a changing climate in the six provinces have been implemented.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The developed targets and indicators for the water sector were broad but with a focus on ensuring water availability during average rainfall amount as well as drought by means of appropriate infrastructure. The overarching goal for the water sector was identified as: <em>"The water management system is able to support water needs for all communities in a changing climate"</em>. In contributing to the achievement of this goal, two targets were established:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Wa1:</strong> By 2030, 100% of water-climate vulnerable rural communities in the six provinces have developed DWSSP and are able to address water needs in <strong>normal and</strong> (climate, disaster and environmentally) <strong>stressed times.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Wa2:</strong> By 2030, 6 <strong>climate-resilient</strong> water protection zones declared and sufficiently provides urban water supply needs in <strong>normal and</strong> (climate, disaster and environmentally) <strong>stressed times.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="loss-and-damage-ld">Loss and Damage (L&amp;D) </h3>
<p>Loss and damage from climate change impact is included in Vanuatu’s National Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy (NCCDRRP) and outlines concrete actions. National stakeholders identified L&amp;D as already occurring, observable and is seen as a future threat, in some instances existential. Stakeholders identified all types of L&amp;D which included, floods, storms, hurricanes, salinisation and slow onset events. Assistance is required in terms of finance and capacity building in order to be able to address L&amp;D. Targets and indicators were developed that are in line with the actions outlined in the NCCDRRP and are based on stakeholders’ responses of what is needed to address L&amp;D.</p>
<p>All targets and indicators for adaptation and L&amp;D that are presented here are country-driven and in line with existing policies and frameworks, allowing for integration of adaptation efforts in already existing national processes. The process applied in this initiative provide a basis to expand adaptation targets and indicators development to other sectors that occur next in the order of priority for Vanuatu such as the fisheries and ocean sector as well as tourism. The same applies to NDC reporting on agriculture and water sectors. Once in-country capacity is increased and improved, adaptation reporting in other sectors can be included.</p>
<h2 id="means-of-implementation">6. Means of Implementation </h2>
<p>The tentative cost of achieving the Vanuatu’s conditional mitigation targets is estimated to be USD $ 173.6 Million. This cost estimation does not cover the costs of existing measures i.e. measures included in the first NDC of Vanuatu); since these measure are already under implementation and already budgeted under NERM: 2016-2030. Furthermore, the costs for additional measures are tentative and based on similar international experiences, national circumstances of Vanuatu and other assumptions. A detailed scoping and feasibility study of enhanced NDC measures will be conducted under the NDC implementation roadmap development to determine the exact additional investment requirements.</p>
<p>To achieve the conditional targets, Vanuatu anticipates financial, technological and capacity building support from global funds such as the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund; and bilateral/multilateral agencies and development partners. These funds will be utilized to bolster limited national resources and technical capacities for scaling up climate action.</p>
<p>The activities will be implemented over a period of 10 years (2021 -2030) by integrating them under the budget as various subsidy policies, projects or programmes. As these targets are well aligned with the country’s existing policies and plans, they will have high ownership and will be implemented in a timely manner. Vanuatu has already in place the institutional structure for implementation of enhanced NDC, the National Advisory Board (NAB), is the supreme policy making and advisory body for all disaster risk reduction and climate change programs, projects, initiatives and activities in Vanuatu. NAB develops Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change policies, guidelines and positions, advises on international and regional DRR and CC obligations, facilitates and endorses the development of new DRR &amp; CC programs, projects, initiatives and activities, acts as a focal point for information sharing and coordination on CC/DRR, as well as guides and coordinates the development of national climate finance processes.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Climate Change Adaptation (MoCC), Meteorology &amp; Geo-Hazards, Energy, Environment and National Disaster Management is the nodal agency as part of the Government's efforts to streamline Vanuatu's climate change natural disaster responses and sustainable development of the environment. The Department of Climate Change (DoCC) within the Ministry of Climate Change, mandated to: ensure that high quality services are provided in relation to climate change in Vanuatu. The Ministry and the National Advisory Board (NAB) are mandated with coordinating all government and non-government initiatives addressing climate change and disaster risk reduction in the country.</p>
<p>The Vanuatu’s enhanced NDC will be implemented in close coordination with other line ministries like Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU), Ministries of Education and Health, Ministry of Finance etc. other government departments specially Department of Energy (DoE),Department of Environment, Utilities Regulatory Authority (URA); Public and private sector mainly UNELCO Engie (UNELCO), Vanuatu Utilities &amp; Infrastructure Limited (VUI) and Other Private Sector Service Providers; Doner agencies and development partners and Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs).</p>
