<h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Samoa is an island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, that is made up of nine (9) volcanic islands &ndash;two of which are Savai&rsquo;i and Upolu. Upolu is the most populated where the capital city Apia is located, and Savai&rsquo;i is the largest of the nine.</p>
<p>Samoa is extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts due to its geographic location, status as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) in the Pacific, and the importance of natural resources to its main economic sectors of fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Samoa is only responsible for an insignificant proportion of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Despite this, Samoa is keen to play its part in global climate change mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>Samoa is experiencing higher average temperatures, greater frequency in extreme daily rainfall events, and sea level rise<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, as well as increases in ocean acidification and coastal erosion<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Changing weather patterns and natural disasters are impacting Samoa&rsquo;s settlements, as 70 percent of the population and infrastructure are located in low-lying coastal areas.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Climate change and variable weather patterns are also impacting the country&rsquo;s primary industries, such as agriculture and fishing.</p>
<p>Predicted increases in extreme weather conditions from climate change indicates that Samoa will face even greater impacts in the future, in addition to living with the constant threat of earthquakes and tsunamis. These impacts, combined with the recent economic shock caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are making the Government&rsquo;s poverty alleviation and national development goals more challenging.</p>
<p>According to Samoa&rsquo;s Second National Communication (SNC) to the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (UNFCCC), Samoa emitted a total of 352.03 Gg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2007. The energy sector accounted for 50 percent of this total, the agriculture forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector accounted for 38 percent, the waste sector accounted for 9 percent, and the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector accounted for 3 percent.</p>
<p>As a leader in climate action and committing to the urgency of the Paris Agreement, Samoa has developed its Second NDC undertaking an inclusive stakeholder engagement process with key national stakeholders, ministries, and departments, with the technical assistance and support of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), in collaboration with the strategic advisory firm Castalia.</p>
<p>Considering its negligible GHG emissions and limited resources, as well as the ongoing disruption and uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC is ambitious and reflects the urgency of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Mitigation</p>
<p>Samoa aims to reduce overall GHG emissions by 26 percent in 2030 compared to 2007 levels (or by 91 Gg CO2e compared to the new reference year<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> once Samoa&rsquo;s GHG emissions inventory has been updated).<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>This economy-wide emissions reduction target comprises the following sector-specific mitigation targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy </strong>- reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> by 30 percent in 2030 compared to 2007 levels (or by 53 Gg CO2e compared to the new reference year once the GHG emissions inventory is updated).<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waste </strong>- reduce GHG emissions in the waste sector by 4 percent in 2030 compared to 2007 levels (or by 1.2 Gg CO2e compared to the new reference year once the GHG emissions inventory is updated).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AFOLU </strong>- reduce GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector by 26 percent in 2030 compared to 2007 levels (or by 35.2 Gg CO2e compared to the new reference year once the GHG emissions inventory is updated).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptation</p>
<p>Samoa&rsquo;s National Climate Change Policy 2020 &ndash; 2030 provides the framework for both national adaptation and mitigation actions through a whole-of-country approach to build resilience to the impacts of climate change. At the community level, Samoa has developed Community Integrated Management (CIM) Plans which identify prioritized adaptation actions by all of Samoa&rsquo;s 368 villages to enhance their climate resilience. This work builds on Samoa&rsquo;s successful implementation of its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2005.</p>
<p>Building on current adaptation actions, Samoa identifies the following quantitative targets that contribute to adaptation in the marine and AFOLU sectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p></a>Marine - expand the area of mangrove forests in Samoa by 5 percent by 2030 relative to 2018.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFOLU - expand the area under agroforestry to an additional 5 percent of agricultural land by 2030 relative to 2018.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFOLU - manage forests sustainably and increase total forest cover by 2 percent by 2030 relative to 2013.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is expected that these adaptation targets will also contribute to mitigation.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Mitigation and adaptation targets are conditional on external financial support.</p>
<h3>2. National Circumstances</h3>
<p>Geographical characteristics</p>
<p>The Independent State of Samoa consists of two main islands, Savai&rsquo;i (1,700 square kilometers) and Upolu (1,100 square kilometers), and eight smaller islands, making up a total land area of 2,900 square kilometers.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The capital, Apia, is located on Upolu. Samoa has an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 120,000 square kilometers.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Samoa has mountainous terrain as well as narrow coastal settlements.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Climate profile</p>
<p>Samoa has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons: a hot and wet season (November&mdash;April) and cool and a dry season (May&mdash;October). Samoa's annual mean rainfall ranges from 3,000 to 6,000 millimeters, with approximately 70 percent of annual rainfall occurring in the hot and wet season. The south to southeast regions of the main islands experience more rainfall than the north to northwest regions. The El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> brings lower than average rainfall for Samoa and is associated with droughts and forest fires. La Ni&ntilde;a <a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> brings above average rainfall, and is associated with flooding of low-lying areas, particularly in and around Apia.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The mean annual temperature ranges from 26 to 31 degrees Celsius.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Humidity is high, at approximately 80 percent. Southeast trade winds dominate Samoa all year round.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Samoa is experiencing greater maximum air temperature, greater frequency in extreme daily rainfall events, sea level rise of 5.2 millimeters (mm) per annum, and maximum hourly sea level increasing at a rate of 8.2 mm per annum,<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> as well as increases in ocean acidification and coastal erosion.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Higher sea-surface temperatures, cyclones, and longer, more frequent droughts are additional climate change-related risks for Samoa.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Samoa is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because about 70 percent of the population and infrastructure are located in low-lying coastal areas,<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and citizens rely on the productivity of primary industries such as agriculture and fishing, which have been adversely impacted by changing weather patterns and natural disasters.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Population profile</p>
<p>Samoa&rsquo;s total population is approximately 202,500.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Of this total, approximately 77 percent live on Upolu, 22 percent live on Savai&rsquo;i, and the remaining population live on the outer islands of Manono and Apolima.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Approximately 19 percent of Samoa&rsquo;s population live in urban areas, while 81 percent live in rural areas.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The country has approximately 340 villages, which are divided into 43 districts. These districts are grouped into four regions: Apia Urban Area (AUA), North-West Upolu (NWU), Rest of Upolu (ROU) and Savaii (SAV).<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Samoa&rsquo;s average population density is 70 people per square kilometer.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Samoa has a relatively young population, with a median age of 22 years.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> More than 57 percent of the population is aged 15-64 years, 37 percent are aged under 15, while only 5 percent are 65 years old and above.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Approximately 23 percent of Samoa&rsquo;s population live below the poverty line, as of 2018.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Poverty rates have fluctuated over the past ten years, largely due to Cyclone Evan (2012), Cyclone Gita (2018), and the measles epidemic (2019). Poverty rates are expected to increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Socio-economic background</p>
<p>Samoa&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year ended December 2020 was US$733 million, with a per capita GDP of US$3,630.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Economic activity declined by 8 percent in the December 2020 quarter, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Before the pandemic, Samoa&rsquo;s GDP for the year ended December 2019 was US$804 million, with a per capita GDP of US$3,970.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The service sector (tertiary sector) is the largest contributing sector, making up approximately 74 percent of total nominal GDP in 2019.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The primary sectors (including agriculture and fisheries) share of GDP has declined in recent years, contributing approximately 10 percent of GDP in 2019.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The total value of Samoa&rsquo;s exports was US$49 million in 2019<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>, made up of approximately 28 percent re- exports, and 72 percent domestically produced exports<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>. The top five exported products (by trade value) are petroleum<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>, fresh fish, taro, crude coconut oil, and beer<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>. Exports are sent chiefly to American Samoa, New Zealand, the United States, Tokelau, and Australia.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Exports are subject to constraints, such as price instability, high transport costs, lack of overseas markets, and harsh weather conditions.</p>
<h3>3. Mitigation</h3>
<p>3.1 Priorities for Mitigation</p>
<p>According to Samoa&rsquo;s SNC to the UNFCCC, Samoa&rsquo;s total GHG emissions was 352.03 Gg CO2e in 2007.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> 50 percent of this total comes from the energy sector, while 38 percent comes from the AFOLU sector. Waste and Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) emit 12 percent of GHGs in Samoa.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>In developing this NDC, Samoa focused on opportunities to reduce emissions in the energy sector (including electricity, land transport, maritime transport, and tourism), the waste sector, and the AFOLU sector. Samoa did not develop a GHG emissions reduction target for the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GHG emissions from IPPU represent only a small fraction (less than 3 percent) of Samoa&rsquo;s total GHG emissions, given the absence of mineral, chemical, metal, electronics, and other manufacturing industries as well as the limited use of lubricants, paraffin waxes, and solvents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a lack of data on emissions from the IPPU sector.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Samoa wishes to communicate the following targets for reducing GHG emissions in the energy, waste and AFOLU sectors, detailed in Table 3.1.</a></p>

<p>Note: Targets are informed by the emissions reduction potential of projects in the NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan (including project pipeline), which has been developed alongside Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC.</p>
<p>3.2 Energy Sector</p>
<p>Targets</p>
<p>Samoa aims to reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> by 30 percent in 2030 compared to 2007 levels<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> (or by 53 Gg CO2e compared to the new reference year once the GHG emissions inventory is updated).<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets</p>
<p>Electricity</p>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions in the electricity sub-sector may be achieved by expanding renewable electricity generation, introducing monitoring and energy efficiency programs, and introducing grid stabilization and network loss reduction programs. Samoa aims to generate 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Samoa will require external financial support to achieve this goal. The successful adoption of energy efficiency programs will require appropriate financing measures to meet greater upfront costs of energy efficient buildings and appliances. These energy efficiency projects will also require external financial support. Grid stabilization and network loss reduction programs will require technology transfer, capacity building, and external financial support.</p>
<p>Land transport</p>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions in the land transport sector may be achieved by initially electrifying a percentage of vehicles in Samoa, with an incremental percentage increase each year. This shall also provide an opportunity for the inclusion of shared electric micro mobility.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The successful adoption of these measures will require further feasibility studies and assessments, public acceptance of changes to transportation modes, technology transfer, capacity building, and external financial support.</p>
<p>Maritime transport</p>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions in the maritime transport sector may be achieved by developing shore side electricity supply for vessels and reviewing the energy efficiency of maritime transport, introducing renewable energy technologies to vessels (solar and biodiesel), and conducting studies to understand viability of low carbon transport options. While energy efficiency reviews and development of shore-side electricity supply can be achieved without external financial support, the development of renewable energy technologies on vessels and the exploration of low-carbon maritime transport options will require technology transfer, capacity building, and external financial support.</p>
<p>Tourism</p>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions in the tourism sector may be achieved by implementing and monitoring energy efficiency programs for appliances. The successful adoption of energy efficient appliances will require appropriate financing measures to meet greater upfront costs, however these could be funded by long-term electricity costs savings. Given the lack of visitors caused by COVID-19, Samoa&rsquo;s tourism sector will require grant funding and external financial support to adopt energy efficient appliances.</p>

<p>Samoa set the target of reducing GHG emissions in the waste sector by 4 percent in 2030 compared to 2007 levels<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> (or by 1.2 Gg CO2e compared to the new reference year once the GHG emissions inventory is updated).</p>
<p>Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets</p>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions in the waste sector may be achieved by installing geomembranes on landfills in Samoa to capture landfill gas (mainly methane from the anaerobic decomposition of organic material). The successful adoption of this measure will require technology transfer, capacity building, and external financial support.</p>
<p>3.4 AFOLU Sector</p>
<p>Targets</p>
<p>Samoa set the target of reducing GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector by 26 percent in 2030 compared to 2007 levels<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> (or by 35.2 Gg CO2e compared to the new reference year once the GHG emissions inventory is updated).</p>
<p>Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets</p>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector may be achieved by improving agriculture practices through improved manure management and fertilizer use, and reforestation, forest restoration, and promoting agroforestry. The success of improving agriculture practices will require public acceptance of changes to business-as-usual practices, external technical expertise, and external financial support. Reforestation, forest restoration, and promotion of agroforestry will require considerable technical expertise and external financial support. At the national level the consent from landowners and various stakeholders is required to determine the land areas that can be used for forest restoration and reforestation that will be monitored by the designated entity.</p>
<h3>4. Adaptation</h3>
<p>4.1 Priorities for Adaptation</p>
<p>Samoa recognizes that climate change will have significant impacts on the country, particularly in sectors including agriculture, health, tourism, forestry, and water as well as coastal infrastructure and marine ecosystems. These sectors and priority areas are highlighted within the Community Integrated Management (CIM) Plans and National Climate Change Policy 2020-2030.</p>
<p>4.2 Overview of Targets, Measures, and Requirements</p>
<p>In addition to building on the activities outlined in its the Community Integrated Management (CIM) Plans and current National Climate Change Policy 2020-2030, Samoa wishes to communicate the following quantitative targets for adapting to climate change in the marine and AFOLU sectors, as detailed in Table 4.1.</p>

<p>It is expected that these adaptation targets will also contribute to mitigation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>4.3 Marine Sector</p>
<p>Targets</p>
<p>Samoa has set the target of expanding the area of mangrove forests by 5 percent by 2030 relative to 2018.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Expanding the area of mangrove forest will help to protect coastal areas and communities against coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and storm surges. It will also provide valuable habitat for fish, help to protect marine ecosystems, and enhance ecosystem services.</p>
<p>Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets</p>
<p>Expansion of the area under mangrove forests may be achieved through a large-scale program to plant and restore mangrove forests. The success of mangrove restoration and planting will require technical expertise, external financial support, and consent from various stakeholders (including coastal villages) in order to determine the areas on which mangroves will be planted and how mangroves will be planted and monitored.</p>
<p>4.4 AFOLU Sector</p>
<p>Targets</p>
<p>Samoa has set two quantitative targets to contribute to adaptation in the AFOLU sector.</p>
<p>Firstly, Samoa aims to expand the area under agroforestry to an additional 5 percent of agricultural land by 2030 relative to 2018.<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Increasing the use of agroforestry is expected to contribute to several important ecosystem services. For example, agroforestry systems help protect crops from cyclone damage, diversify agricultural incomes, and reduce riverine flood risk.</p>
<p>Secondly, Samoa aims to manage forests sustainably and increase total forest cover by 2 percent by 2030 relative to 2013.<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Managing forests responsibly and promoting afforestation is expected to moderate stream flow (reducing the risk of riverine flooding and drought), protect indigenous ecosystems, preserve cultural values, and maintain the supply of non-timber forest products.</p>
<p>Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets</p>
<p>It is expected that expanding agroforestry will be achieved by awareness raising activities that promote traditional knowledge of agroforestry systems and provide targeted support, including providing seedlings to landholders. Samoa can support the expansion of agroforestry without the need for external financial support, however the success of the agroforestry program will require external technical assistance as well as consent from landholders to determine the areas on which trees will be planted and who will be responsible for planting and monitoring the trees.</p>
<p>It is expected that Samoa can manage forests sustainably gradually and increase total forest cover by developing a program for reforestation and forest restoration. Samoa would require external financial support and technical assistance to develop this program. The expansion of forest area would also require consent from various stakeholders in order to determine the areas on which forest will be planted and who will be responsible for planting and monitoring these areas.</p>
<h3>5. Planning Processes</h3>
<p>5.1 Information on the process to prepare the NDC</p>
<p>Several key sectoral policies, plans, and strategies inform Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC. The Strategy for the Development of Samoa (2016) (SDS) and Samoa 2040 (2021) are Samoa&rsquo;s overarching national planning documents. The SDS lays out the strategy for Samoa&rsquo;s overall development based on the four pillars of sustainable development (economic, social, infrastructure, and environment). Samoa 2040 focuses on Samoa&rsquo;s growth, particularly in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>Other key documents include the Samoa Climate Change Policy 2020, the National Environment Sector Plan 2017-2021, the Energy Sector Plan 2017-2022 (2017), the Energy Management Act (2020), the Transport Sector Plan 2013-2018 (2013), and the Agriculture Sector Plan 2016-2020 (ASP), as well as the National Policy for Gender Equality 2021-2031 (2021) and the Inclusive Governance Policy 2021-2031 (2021). A full list of key sectorial plans and strategies is included in Appendix A.</p>
<p>The Government of Samoa has led the development of Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC. Progress towards achieving the targets identified in Samoa&rsquo;s First NDC was reviewed and mitigation and adaptation opportunities to contribute to this Second NDC were identified. Further details of the review of the First NDC is included in Appendix C. The work to identify mitigation and adaptation opportunities for Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC focused on identifying climate change mitigation and adaptation investment projects, which were informed by data sets, academic studies, policies, strategies, and other reports, as well as consultation workshops and meetings with national stakeholders, including government and non-government organizations, the private sector, and civil society. Given the focus on identifying climate change mitigation and adaptation investment projects rather than policy or regulatory interventions, there will likely be other opportunities to reduce emissions in Samoa beyond those used to form the targets in this NDC.</p>
<p>The recommendations from the review of Samoa&rsquo;s First NDC, project scoping exercise, and stakeholder consultations were integrated into the NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan, discussed in section 5.2. The findings were then validated by MNRE and relevant stakeholders through national consultation workshops and meetings. These workshops and meetings were attended by stakeholders from government and private sector. The Second NDC was prepared building on these recommendations and a second validation process was undertaken based on the draft Second NDC. The Second NDC content had then been agreed across ministries and departments.</p>
<p>5.2 Information on implementation plans</p>
<p>The Government of Samoa is currently developing an NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan (including project pipeline). This work has been undertaken in parallel with developing Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC. The NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan informs the targets included in this NDC and will support Samoa in achieving these targets by setting out practical steps and tangible projects to mitigate GHG emissions across the energy (including sub-sectors), waste, AFOLU, and marine sectors.</p>
<h3>6. Fairness and Ambition</h3>
<p>Samoa is a SIDS and its GHG emissions are negligible on a global scale. Samoa is highly vulnerable to climate change, due to its geography (with majority of the population living in low-lying coastal areas), and its reliance on primary industries (agriculture and fishing) which have been particularly impacted by changing weather patterns and natural disasters. Approximately 22.7 percent of Samoa&rsquo;s population live below the poverty line, as of 2018.<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Poverty rates have fluctuated over the past ten years, largely due to Cyclone Evan (2012), Cyclone Gita (2018), and the measles epidemic (2019). Poverty rates are expected to increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the tourism sector.63 Achieving the targets set out in Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC will require investment of large proportions of Samoa&rsquo;s fiscal budget and public service capacity. The country also requires considerable external financial support, capacity building, and technology investment. Accounting for these national circumstances, Samoa considers its NDC to be fair and ambitious.</p>

  <p>Samoa&rsquo;s 2007 emissions inventory did not include data on marine sector emissions and removals, so it was not possible to set a percentage-based target for emissions reductions in this sector. Therefore, Samoa has set an area-based target for mangrove restoration using recent land cover estimates from 2018.</p>

<p>Samoa&rsquo;s first GHG emission inventory was published in 1999, covering the years 1994&mdash;1997. Samoa&rsquo;s second, and most recent, GHG emissions inventory focused on emissions for the years 2000&mdash;2007, and included a revision of the results from the first GHG inventory to allow a complete assessment of national GHG emission trends. Samoa&rsquo;s GHG emissions and removals in 2007 totaled 352 Gg CO2e and 787.07 Gg CO2e respectively. A summary of Samoa&rsquo;s GHG emissions for the years 1994 (base-year), 2000, and 2007 is presented in Table 6.2.</p>
<p>The anthropogenic emissions and removals in Samoa&rsquo;s second GHG inventory were prepared in accordance with the methodologies and common metrics described in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006 IPCC Guidelines). However, although the 2006 IPCC Guidelines provide a comprehensive overview and categorization of all potential sources of GHG emissions, not all of them are relevant to Samoa. In addition, although certain sources are relevant to Samoa, there are insufficient data to include them in the inventory. Samoa therefore also used the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as they better reflected national circumstances.</p>
<p>Samoa is currently updating its GHG inventory, following the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, using the Tier 1 approach and applying default emission factors.</p>

<p>The second GHG inventory estimates removals from the AFOLU sector. However, there was very limited data available to accurately estimate how changing land use patterns may be affecting CO2 emissions and removals. The estimate of CO2 removals from forests are based on 1999 satellite images and expert opinion about the trends in forest area in the years since. The estimates do account for changes in carbon stocks due to logging and fuelwood extraction, but do not account for possible conversions of forest land to grassland or cropland. This can only be done once up-to-date satellite images have been purchased, analyzed, and compared to the 1999 images.</p>
<p>Samoa strives to report anthropogenic emissions or removals from AFOLU, following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, and the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, using the Tier 1 approach and applying default emission factors.

<p>Source: Samoa&rsquo;s National GHG Inventory, 2007</p>
<h4>Appendix C: Review of First NDC (2015)</h4>
<p>Samoa&rsquo;s First NDC focuses primarily on reducing emissions from the energy sector Samoa included the following goal in its First NDC:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Samoa is] committed to reducing its [greenhouse gas] GHG emissions from the Electricity sub-sector through the adoption of a 100% Renewable energy target for electricity generation through to the year 2025&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government is committed to increasing the use of renewables for electricity generation to improve sustainability and strengthen Samoa&rsquo;s energy sector. Reducing the use of fossil fuels can also have a significant economic benefit by reducing expenditure on fuel imports.</p>
<p>Samoa has achieved 50 percent renewable energy generation<a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>Some national mitigation projects have already been implemented, or are currently underway, that contribute to GHG emissions reductions in multiple sectors. For example, the passenger ferry, Lady Samoa III, recently had solar panels installed on the roof. There has also been an initiative to restore mangroves through the establishment of mangrove conservation areas.</p>
<p>However, Samoa has some way to go to reach its renewable energy targets</p>
<p>Limited financial capability and other constraints are hindering Samoa&rsquo;s ability to make faster progress in reducing emissions.<a href="#fn86" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Samoa is not on track to achieve the targets set in its First NDC. Reaching 100 percent renewable electricity generation in 2017 and maintaining this through 2025 would have reduced operational emissions from the electricity sector to zero. However, the renewable energy percentage in electricity generation in Samoa in 2021 was 50 percent.<a href="#fn87" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> This is an increase in renewable energy share by 24 percentage points (from 26 percent in 2014).</p>
<p>Although the share of renewable energy has increased, total electricity generation also increased from 126,800 MWh in 2014 to 132,000 MWh in 2019.<a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> This increase in generation partially offsets the reduction in GHG emissions from increased renewable energy because fossil fuels are still used for electricity generation.</p>
<p>At present, estimated operational emissions in the electricity sector is 48,225 tCO2e per annum.<a href="#fn88" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Assuming the emissions intensity of non-renewable electricity production remained constant, estimated emissions from the electricity sector decreased by 12 percent between 2014 and 2019.</p>
<p>There is also scope to reduce emissions in other sectors</p>
<p>The First NDC does not include specific goals for any sector other than electricity. Samoa&rsquo;s First NDC indicates significant potential to reduce emissions in sectors other than electricity, such as transport (land and maritime), waste, tourism, marine, and forestry sectors. However, it does not specify how this should be done, nor does it set targets for these other sectors.</p>
<p>GHG emissions reductions across all sectors were framed as being conditional on Samoa receiving external financial assistance from the international community. The First NDC did not specify the projects or policies required to realize GHG emissions reductions in sectors other than electricity.</p>
<p>Opportunities in each priority sector will help determine new GHG emission targets for Samoa&rsquo;s Second NDC</p>
<p>There is a lack of information on the current levels of GHG emissions in each priority sector&mdash; energy (including electricity, transport (land and maritime)), waste, tourism, marine, and AFOLU. The Third National Communication and First Biennial Update Report (BUR) is currently under development, however preliminary findings are not yet available, and are not expected until the second half of 2021. The report will include an updated national Greenhouse Gas Inventory.</p>
<p>While Samoa&rsquo;s First NDC mentioned adaptation, it focused explicitly on mitigation</p>
<p>Samoa&rsquo;s First NDC includes a brief section mentioning the need for adaptation to climate change. In this section, Samoa highlights the work done to develop Samoa&rsquo;s NAPA,<a href="#fn89" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> notes that some progress has been made, and emphasizes the need to build on this work leveraging external financial support. However, Samoa&rsquo;s First NDC does not set any specific targets for adaptation, and the adaptation section of the document explicitly states that the focus of the First NDC is on mitigation.</p>
<h4>Appendix D: Key inputs and feedback from stakeholders</h4>
<p>Selection of a base year</p>
<p>The base year for this NDC is defined by the Government of Samoa as 2007. The most recent GHG inventory for Samoa was completed in 2007, and this contains the most recent estimates of emissions disaggregated by sector. While a new emissions inventory for Samoa is currently being developed, this will not be ready until after Samoa needs to submit its Second NDC to the UNFCCC ahead of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. Therefore, the Government of Samoa communicates this Second NDC based on the 2007 GHG emissions inventory.</p>
<p>Number of projects that can be implemented concurrently in each sector</p>
<p>Stakeholders detailed the number of projects that could be implemented at the same time in each sector, summarized in Table D.1.</a> This feedback is informed by institutional constraints and context in each sector, such as financial limitations, human capacity constraints, and experience implementing GHG mitigation projects. This feedback was important when sequencing possible GHG mitigation projects<a href="#fn90" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> and enabled reasonable targets to be assigned to each sector.</p>

<p>GHG mitigation project prioritization</p>
<p>Stakeholders provided feedback on the prioritization of possible GHG mitigation projects, using a score from 1 to 5 (in which 1 indicates they think the project should receive the lowest priority and 5 indicates they think the project should receive the highest priority). This prioritization ensured that local expert advice was at the forefront of Samoa&rsquo;s pipeline of mitigation projects.<a href="#fn97" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn4">Gross emissions of 352.03 Gg in 2007 are taken as the baseline for this overall target. Samoa&rsquo;s last comprehensive GHG inventory was prepared in 2007. It monitored the years 2000 to 2007 for each sector. Samoa is in the process of updating its GHG inventory to reflect changes since 2007. However, given the urgency of developing a Second NDC for Samoa, the Government of Samoa has used 2007 data to develop this Second NDC. SIDS have flexibility in their submissions under the Paris Agreement, therefore Samoa has included this alternative specification of the overall mitigation target to ensure it can use updated information on national emissions when this becomes available.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn5">This overall target, and the subsidiary sector-specific targets, are set based on the aggregate emissions reduction potential of a pipeline of climate change mitigation projects identified in Samoa&rsquo;s NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan. The economy-wide target accounts for emissions reductions from adaptation actions, therefore it is greater than the sum of the energy, waste, and AFOLU sector mitigation targets.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn6">To ensure accuracy against GHG emissions reported in 2007, the energy sector includes the electricity, land transport, maritime transport, and tourism sub-sectors. While emissions from these sub-sectors were not reported in a way that would allow Samoa to form sub-sector targets relative to the 2007 emissions inventory baseline, Samoa would like to put forward to following mass-based sub-sector GHG emissions reduction targets that can be applied relative to the new reference year once the GHG emissions inventory is updated:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Electricity 44.2 Gg CO2e</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land transport 5.2 Gg CO2e</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maritime transport 3.0 Gg CO2e</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tourism 0.5 Gg CO2e</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each sub-sector has specific means to achieve the overall energy sector target.</p><a href="#fnref6">↩</a></li>

Based on the requests from the Government of Samoa, GGGI, as an implementation partner of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub, engaged a consulting firm Castalia Advisors Ltd to enhance Samoa&rsquo;s NDC and develop an NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan. This project involved gathering inputs from stakeholders in Samoa, identifying gaps in and progress of the First NDC, forming mitigation targets in the electricity, land and maritime transport, tourism, waste, marine, and AFOLU sectors in Samoa, and identifying measures to achieve these targets. It also involved developing an NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan that sets out practical steps and tangible projects that will help Samoa achieve its NDC targets.</p>
<p>Stakeholders in Samoa were involved at every step when identifying climate change mitigation projects and developing the NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan. Stakeholders included government officials, technical experts, and other industry representatives.

<li id="fn73">Samoa&rsquo;s last comprehensive GHG inventory was prepared in 2007. It monitored the years 2000 to 2007 for each sector. Samoa is in the process of updating its GHG inventory to reflect changes since 2007. However, given the urgency of developing a Second NDC for Samoa, the Government of Samoa has used 2007 data to develop this Second NDC.<a href="#fnref73">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn74"><p>The overall target, and the subsidiary sector-specific targets, are set based on the aggregate emissions reduction potential of a pipeline of climate change mitigation projects identified in Samoa&rsquo;s NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan. Based on the requests from the Government of Samoa, GGGI, as an implementation partner of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub, engaged a consulting firm Castalia Advisors Ltd to enhance Samoa&rsquo;s NDC and develop an NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan. This project involved gathering inputs from stakeholders in Samoa, identifying gaps in and progress of the First NDC, forming mitigation targets in the electricity, land and maritime transport, tourism, waste, marine, and AFOLU sectors in Samoa, and identifying measures to achieve these targets. It also involved developing an NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan that sets out practical steps and tangible projects that will help Samoa achieve its NDC targets.</p>
<p>Stakeholders in Samoa were involved at every step when identifying climate change mitigation projects and developing the NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan. Stakeholders included government officials, technical experts, and other industry representatives. The NDC Implementation Roadmap and NDC Investment Plan includes gender responsive considerations in the form of guidelines for promoting gender and social inclusion. MNRE took a coordinating role in gathering input from stakeholders and reviewing the outputs of the project.<a href="#fnref74">↩</a></li></p>
<li id="fn75"><p>To ensure accuracy against GHG emissions reported in 2007, the following sub-sectors have been included under the energy sector:</p>
<p>Electricity &gt; Land transport &gt; Maritime transport &gt; Tourism</p>
<p>Each sub-sector has specific means to achieve the overall energy sector target.<a href="#fnref75">↩</a></li></p>
<li id="fn76">To avoid double counting, the GHG emissions reductions of the 100 percent renewable electricity sector project is taken as the total GHG emissions reduction potential in the electricity sub-sector.<a href="#fnref76">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn77"><p>Given the lack of data on marine sector emissions, it is not possible to specify a numerical reduction target. Samoa has set an area-based target for mangrove restoration using recent land cover estimates from 2018.</p>
<p>It is expected that expansion of mangroves forests will also contribute to climate change mitigation, however, Samoa&rsquo;s 2007 emissions inventory did not include data on marine sector emissions and removals, so it was not possible to set a percentage-based target for emissions reductions in this sector.<a href="#fnref77">↩</a></li></p>
