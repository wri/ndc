<h1>Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Zambia for the timeframe 2015-2030 Updated as of 23 December 2020</h1>

<h2><strong>1.0 Background</strong></h2>
<p>This document presents a revised and updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for Zambia to the Paris Agreement on climate change. This pursuant to Decision <em><strong>1/CP.19, 1/CP.20</strong></em> and <em><strong>1/CP.21</strong></em> of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for countries to enhance their climate ambitions and update their Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020.</p>
<p>Zambia’s first NDC was submitted on 9<sup>th</sup> December, 2016, and consisted of both mitigation and adaptation components based on the country’s national circumstances. This NDC was submitted with a conditional pledge of reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 25% (20,000 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.) by 2030 against a base year of 2010 under the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario with limited international support or by 47% (38,000 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.) with substantial international support. The mitigation actions were focused on three programmes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sustainable forest management;</li>
<li>Sustainable agriculture, and;</li>
<li>Renewable energy and energy efficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adaptation actions in this NDC were focused on strategic productive systems (agriculture, wildlife and water), strategic infrastructure and health systems and enhanced capacity building, research, technology transfer and finance for adaptation. The country requires substantial resources to meet the means of implementation of these interventions.</p>
<p><em><strong>By this submission Zambia enhances its NDC by broadening the scope of sectors under mitigation by adding transport, liquid waste and coal (production, transportation and consumption) and by elaborating the adaptation component of the NDC by developing indicators that will enable the country track progress on building resilience in both the human and physical systems and on adaptation actions.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>1.1 Further information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of Zambia's NDC</strong></em></p>
<p>Zambia has used the guidance on information to provide clarity, transparency and understanding in Decision <em><strong>4/CMA.1</strong></em> for information provided in the Annex to this submission, as applicable to its NDC.</p>
<h3>1.1 Further information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding for the enhanced nationally determined contribution may be provided at a later date, when there is more clarity on the updated nationally determined contribution.</h3>

<p>By this submission Zambia enhances its Nationally Determined Contribution by broadening the scope of sectors under mitigation by adding transport, liquid waste and coal (production, transportation and consumption). This translates into additional categories which demonstrates the consideration of paragraph 31(c) and (d) of decision 1/CP.21</p>
<p><strong>Responding to the request in para. 31(c) of decision 1/CP.21</strong>, through this submission, Zambia demonstrates it has striven to enhance its NDC by broadening the scope of sectors which contribute to the country’s mitigation efforts. Zambia is now considering all sectors and categories as potential contributors to its mitigation efforts. Zambia is prioritising mitigation actions that it considers likely to be effective and reliable, targeted where possible at GHG inventory key categories, and, cost-effective. For brevity, this NDC presents a summary of the mitigation actions by sector, and not by category.</p>
<p><strong>Energy – Stationary combustion</strong></p>
<p>Major mitigation themes are: 1) better access to electrical energy; 2) better resilience, transmission efficiency, and, interconnectivity of the electricity supply network, 3) greater energy efficiency of both generation and consumption; 4) increased generation of and increased use of renewable energy. The investments Zambia are making in lowcarbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies are expected to reduce the energy intensity of our economic development, the carbon intensity of energy production, GHG emissions, and the long-term costs of mitigation.</p>
<p><strong>Energy – Transport</strong></p>
<p>Major mitigation themes are: 1) improved fuel efficiency; 2) modal shift; 3) improved transport infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU)</strong></p>
<p>Major mitigation themes are: 1) increased energy efficiency of processes; 2) improvements in technology.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture</strong></p>
<p>Major mitigation themes are: 1) conservation and sustainable agriculture; 2) efficient agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>Waste</strong></p>
<p>Major mitigation themes are: 1) improved solid waste handling and disposal practices; 2) reduction in waste generation; 3) generation of biomethane from waste; 4) improved waste-water treatment practices.</p>
<p><strong>Forestry and Land Use</strong></p>
<p>Major mitigation themes are: 1) reduction in deforestation; 2) increase in afforestation and reforestation; 3) improved forest management; 4) careful agro-forestry practice.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to the request in para. 31(d) of decision 1/CP.21</strong>, Zambia has not explicitly decided to exclude any sectors. Zambia has instead focussed its efforts on sectors with the greatest mitigation potential, with the greatest likelihood of rapid implementation, aligned where possible with the GHG inventory Key Category Analysis.</p>

<p>The National Designated Authority (NDA) for the Green Climate Fund has already been designated and is expected to play a key role of “clearing house or entity” for climate change projects to be funded from GCF in Zambia. The process is on-going to select a National Implementing Entity (NIE) and establishing a National Climate Change Fund (NCCF).</p>

<p><em><strong>Food security</strong>:</em> Zambia's role in global food security in the context of climate change is to adapt to a changing climate, manage and use these resources sustainably, to secure food supplies while emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gender equality</strong>:</em> In 2018, the Government Republic of Zambia with support from cooperating partners developed and launched a Climate Change Gender Action Plan (CCGAP) which ensures that Zambia’s climate change processes mainstream gender considerations to guarantee that women and men can have access to, participate in, and benefit equally from climate change initiatives.</p>
<p><em><strong>Youth actions</strong>:</em></p>
<p>Education and training are important elements in enhancing the country’s capacity to effectively undertake climate change actions. In order to ensure sustained implementation of education and training activities in the country, the National Policy on Education was formulated to provide a framework for education at primary and secondary school levels. In addition, a National Climate Change Learning Strategy has been developed to strengthen individual and institutional systemic capacities of the energy, forestry, health, agriculture and education sectors to enable them to deliver climate change.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>:</em></p>
<p>Zambia’s current National Development Plan (7NDP) has embraced an integrated multisectoral approach. The country has domesticated the SDGs, the AU Agenda 2063, among others, into its 7NDP. The 7NDP has mainstreamed 86% of SDGs goals and targets. Consequently, implementation and reporting on SDGs are coordinated through the institutional structures at national and sub-national levels using the Cluster approach.
