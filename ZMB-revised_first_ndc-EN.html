<h1>Zambia's NDC</h1>

<h2>REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA</h2>
<h1>1.0 Background</h1>
<p>This document presents a revised and updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for Zambia to the Paris Agreement on climate change. This is pursuant to Decision 1/CP.19, 1/CP.20 and 1/CP.21 of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for countries to enhance their climate ambitions and update their Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020.</p>
<p>Zambia&rsquo;s first NDC was submitted on 9th December, 2016, and consisted of both mitigation and adaptation components based on the country&rsquo;s national circumstances. This NDC was submitted with a conditional pledge of reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 25% (20,000 Gg CO2 eq.) by 2030 against a base year of 2010 under the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario with limited international support<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or by 47% (38,000 Gg CO2 eq.) with substantial international support<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The mitigation actions were focused on three programmes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sustainable forest management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustainable agriculture, and;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Renewable energy and energy efficiency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Adaptation actions in this NDC were focused on strategic productive systems (agriculture, wildlife and water), strategic infrastructure and health systems and enhanced capacity building, research, technology transfer and finance for adaptation. The country requires substantial resources to meet the means of implementation of these interventions.</p>
<p>By this submission Zambia enhances its NDC by broadening the scope of sectors under mitigation by adding transport, liquid waste and coal (production, transportation and consumption) and by elaborating the adaptation component of the NDC by developing indicators that will enable the country track progress on building resilience in both the human and physical systems and on adaptation actions.</p>
<p>1.1 Further information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of Zambia's NDC.</p>
<p>Zambia has used the guidance on information to provide clarity, transparency and understanding in Decision 4/CMA.1 for information provided in the Annex to this submission, as applicable to its NDC.</p>
<p>Zambia intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% (at Business As Usual (BAU) level of international support prevailing in 2015) and towards 47% (with substantial international support) compared to 2010 levels.</p>

<p>a.) Zambia has a total surface area of 752,614 km2 out of which 99 percent is made up of land area and 1percent is covered by water. The country&rsquo;s population was estimated at 13,092,666 in 2010 with approximately 60.5 percent living in rural areas and 39.5 percent lived in urban areas. The population growth rate was approximately 2.8 percent.</p>
<p>In 2010, Zambia&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 7.6 percent compared to 3.5 percent in 2000. This economic growth rate was largely driven by agriculture, infrastructure developments including increased metal production following a rebound in copper prices on international markets and provision of various tax incentives in the agricultural and mining sectors. Zambia&rsquo;s agricultural sector is the socio-economic backbone of the rural population, with 60 percent being dependent on the sector as the main source of income and livelihood. Many of the farmers are poor and engage in low-productivity rain-fed subsistence farming resulting from inadequate resources for the purchase of inputs, use of inappropriate farming practices and failure to fully develop the irrigation potential. These challenges are exacerbated by increased frequency of extreme weather events such as rainfall variation, floods and droughts caused by climate change, and in the last two years, effects of the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>About one sixth of the rural population depends heavily on forests and non-forest resources for their livelihood and contribute approximately 20 percent to rural household incomes. However, charcoal and fuel wood production including clearance of forest land for agriculture and settlement expansion has resulted in high rates of deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions. The country&rsquo;s annual deforestation rate was estimated at 276,021 hectares per annum.</p>

<p>Youth Participation:</p>
<p>Zambia has put in place a National Youth Policy which provides for strategies and programs for youth participation in the development agenda. A National Climate Change Learning Strategy was developed in 2020 to strengthen individual and institutional systemic capacities of the energy, forestry, health, agriculture and education sectors to enable them to deliver climate change.</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):</p>
<p>Zambia&rsquo;s National Development Plan (7NDP) of 2017 to 2021 has embraced an integrated multi-sectoral approach. The country has domesticated the SDGs, the African Union Agenda 2063, among others, into its 7NDP. The 7NDP has mainstreamed 86% of SDGs goals and targets. Consequently, implementation and reporting on SDGs are coordinated through the institutional structures at national and sub-national levels using the Multisectoral approach. This approach is likely to be replicated in the country&rsquo;s 8NDP to run from 2022 to 2026.</p>

<p>As one of the least contributors to global GHG emissions, Zambia places significant importance and priority on adaptation to the effects of climate change in order to enhance the resilience of its population, ecosystems, infrastructure, productive and health systems. The key socio-economic sectors identified as most vulnerable to climate change impacts include: agriculture, water, forestry, energy, wildlife, infrastructure and health. All the adaptation actions have strong synergies with mitigation actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of implementation, Zambia will take a landscape approach at watershed level to enhance synergies between adaptation and mitigation actions. Zambia has six major watersheds: Tanganyika; Luapula; Chambeshi; Luangwa; Kafue; and Zambezi.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The adaptation measures comprise three (3) goals/programs and 13 priority actions, which will also result in mitigation co benefits. The programs include:</p>
<p>Program 1: Adaptation of strategic productive systems (agriculture, wildlife, water)</p>
<p>Which include: 1. Guaranteed food security through diversification and promotion of Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) practices for crop, livestock and fisheries production including conservation of germplasm for land races and their wild relatives.</p>
<p>2. Develop a National Wildlife Adaptation Strategy and ensure its implementation through supportive policies, local community, civil society and private sector participation.</p>
<p>3. Protection and conservation of water catchment areas and enhanced investment in water capture, storage and transfer (linked to agriculture, energy, ecological, industrial and domestic use purposes) in selected watersheds.</p>
<p>Program 2: Adaptation of strategic infrastructure and health systems</p>

<p>This growth rate (8.85% pa) was then applied to the 2016 inventory emissions and projected out to 2050.</p>
<p>A baseline projection for forest land was calculated through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The net CO2 emissions are the sum of the emissions and removals. Here, we use the current deforestation rate of 0.7% (Government of the Republic of Zambia, 2020b) to project forward the changes in a) emissions and b) removals.</p>

<p>A baseline projection for cropland was calculated by:</p>
<p>1. Using a population growth rate to determine the projected CO2 emissions. By using a population growth rate of 2.9% up to 2030 and then a lower growth rate of 2.48% for the period of 2030-2050. Population data was obtained from from Worldometer (2021)</p>
<p>A baseline projection for waste was calculated:</p>
<p>- For solid waste, assuming that the currently low amount of waste generation per capita increases with GDP and that total amount of waste increases with population. Furthermore, assuming that the currently low rate of collection and landfilling of waste increases up to 80% by 2050.</p>

<p>Zambia considers the updated NDC as fair and ambitious enough to contribute to low carbon and climate resilient economy by 2030 in accordance with its national circumstance and desire to become a low carbon and climate resilient middle income and prosperous country by 2030. Zambia is a low contributor to the global greenhouse gas emission. In developing the NDC, Zambia considered the general principles and provisions of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, especially those related to Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) and equitable access to atmospheric space.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s NDC is guided by the country&rsquo;s desire to reduce poverty, address the challenges of COVID 19, attainment of low carbon and climate resilient economy through sustainable development and become a middle income and prosperous nation by 2030 in line with the country&rsquo;s Vision 2030.</p>
<p>The successful implementation of Zambia&rsquo;s NDC is conditional and dependent on the level of support to be provided through the Convention and other multilateral and bilateral arrangements.</p>

<p>Zambia's updated and revised nationally determined contribution represents a progression beyond its previously communicated nationally determined contribution, as it broadens the scope of sectors under mitigation by adding transport, liquid waste and coal (production, transportation and consumption) and elaborates the adaptation component of the NDC by developing indicators that will enable the country track progress on building resilience in both the human and physical systems.</p>
